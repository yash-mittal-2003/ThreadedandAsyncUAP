939987 [180] Chapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov
939987 [181] 
939987 [182] 
939987 [183] Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [184] Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and
939987 [185] still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which
939987 [186] happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper
939987 [187] place. For the present I will only say that this â€œlandownerâ€â€”for so we
939987 [188] used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own
939987 [189] estateâ€”was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a
939987 [190] type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of
939987 [191] those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their
939987 [192] worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [193] for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest;
939987 [194] he ran to dine at other menâ€™s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet
939987 [195] at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard
939987 [196] cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless,
939987 [197] fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not
939987 [198] stupidityâ€”the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and
939987 [199] intelligent enoughâ€”but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of
939987 [200] it.
939987 [201] 
939987 [202] He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first
939987 [203] wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s first
939987 [204] wife, AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble
939987 [205] family, also landowners in our district, the MiÃ¼sovs. How it came to pass
939987 [206] that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those
939987 [207] vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes
939987 [208] also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny
939987 [209] weakling, as we all called him, I wonâ€™t attempt to explain. I knew a young
939987 [210] lady of the last â€œromanticâ€ generation who after some years of an
939987 [211] enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have
939987 [212] married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and
939987 [213] ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid
939987 [214] river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to
939987 [215] satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeareâ€™s Ophelia. Indeed, if
939987 [216] this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less
939987 [217] picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most
939987 [218] likely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and
939987 [219] probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or
939987 [220] three generations. AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna MiÃ¼sovâ€™s action was similarly, no
939987 [221] doubt, an echo of other peopleâ€™s ideas, and was due to the irritation
939987 [222] caused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her
939987 [223] feminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism of
939987 [224] her family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for
939987 [225] a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic
939987 [226] position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive
939987 [227] epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
939987 [228] What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement,
939987 [229] and this greatly captivated AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovnaâ€™s fancy. Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [230] position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, for
939987 [231] he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another. To
939987 [232] attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring
939987 [233] prospect. As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in the
939987 [234] bride or in him, in spite of AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovnaâ€™s beauty. This was,
939987 [235] perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who
939987 [236] was always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on
939987 [237] the slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman who
939987 [238] made no particular appeal to his senses.
939987 [239] 
939987 [240] Immediately after the elopement AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna discerned in a flash
939987 [241] that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage
939987 [242] accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.
939987 [243] Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the
939987 [244] runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most
939987 [245] disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It was
939987 [246] said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity
939987 [247] than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up
939987 [248] to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that those
939987 [249] thousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the rather
939987 [250] fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a
939987 [251] long time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance. He
939987 [252] would probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire to
939987 [253] get rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his
939987 [254] persistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, AdelaÃ¯da
939987 [255] Ivanovnaâ€™s family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is known
939987 [256] for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife,
939987 [257] but rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was
939987 [258] beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient
939987 [259] woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the
939987 [260] house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity
939987 [261] student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husbandâ€™s
939987 [262] hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the
939987 [263] house, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he
939987 [264] used to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all
939987 [265] of AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovnaâ€™s having left him, going into details too disgraceful
939987 [266] for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to
939987 [267] gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part
939987 [268] of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.
939987 [269] 
939987 [270] â€œOne would think that youâ€™d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seem
939987 [271] so pleased in spite of your sorrow,â€ scoffers said to him. Many even added
939987 [272] that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and
939987 [273] that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of
939987 [274] his ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At
939987 [275] last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor
939987 [276] woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity
939987 [277] student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete
939987 [278] emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making
939987 [279] preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself
939987 [280] have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do
939987 [281] so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another
939987 [282] bout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wifeâ€™s family
939987 [283] received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly
939987 [284] in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had
939987 [285] it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wifeâ€™s
939987 [286] death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting
939987 [287] with joy, raising his hands to Heaven: â€œLord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
939987 [288] depart in peace,â€ but others say he wept without restraint like a little
939987 [289] child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the
939987 [290] repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true,
939987 [291] that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who
939987 [292] released him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more
939987 [293] naÃ¯ve and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.

939987 [296] 
939987 [297] Chapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son
939987 [298] 
939987 [299] 
939987 [300] You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would
939987 [301] bring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what might be
939987 [302] expected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with AdelaÃ¯da
939987 [303] Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but
939987 [304] simply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his
939987 [305] tears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a
939987 [306] faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya
939987 [307] into his care. If he hadnâ€™t looked after him there would have been no one
939987 [308] even to change the babyâ€™s little shirt.
939987 [309] 
939987 [310] It happened moreover that the childâ€™s relations on his motherâ€™s side
939987 [311] forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow,
939987 [312] Mityaâ€™s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his
939987 [313] daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in
939987 [314] old Grigoryâ€™s charge and lived with him in the servantâ€™s cottage. But if
939987 [315] his father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether
939987 [316] unaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as
939987 [317] the child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a
939987 [318] cousin of Mityaâ€™s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov, happened to return
939987 [319] from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that
939987 [320] time quite a young man, and distinguished among the MiÃ¼sovs as a man of
939987 [321] enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals
939987 [322] and abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the type
939987 [323] common in the forties and fifties. In the course of his career he had come
939987 [324] into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in
939987 [325] Russia and abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in
939987 [326] his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the
939987 [327] Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost
939987 [328] taken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most
939987 [329] grateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of
939987 [330] about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate
939987 [331] lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our
939987 [332] famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless
939987 [333] lawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rights
939987 [334] of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I donâ€™t know
939987 [335] exactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of
939987 [336] culture to open an attack upon the â€œclericals.â€ Hearing all about AdelaÃ¯da
939987 [337] Ivanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time
939987 [338] been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, in
939987 [339] spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.
939987 [340] He made the latterâ€™s acquaintance for the first time, and told him
939987 [341] directly that he wished to undertake the childâ€™s education. He used long
939987 [342] afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak
939987 [343] of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not
939987 [344] understand what child he was talking about, and even as though he was
939987 [345] surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story may
939987 [346] have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.
939987 [347] 
939987 [348] Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an
939987 [349] unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to
939987 [350] his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This
939987 [351] habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some
939987 [352] of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch
939987 [353] carried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor
939987 [354] Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house
939987 [355] and land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this
939987 [356] cousinâ€™s keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and after
939987 [357] securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to
939987 [358] Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living in
939987 [359] Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too,
939987 [360] forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out,
939987 [361] making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his
939987 [362] life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her
939987 [363] married daughters. I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. I
939987 [364] wonâ€™t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor
939987 [365] Pavlovitchâ€™s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential
939987 [366] facts about him, without which I could not begin my story.
939987 [367] 
939987 [368] In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the
939987 [369] only one of Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s three sons who grew up in the belief that
939987 [370] he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. He
939987 [371] spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the
939987 [372] gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was
939987 [373] promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion
939987 [374] again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin
939987 [375] to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and
939987 [376] until then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [377] for the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on
939987 [378] purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have liked
939987 [379] his father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away,
939987 [380] having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an
939987 [381] agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value
939987 [382] of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get
939987 [383] a statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time
939987 [384] then (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated
939987 [385] idea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this,
939987 [386] as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young man
939987 [387] was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and
939987 [388] that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although
939987 [389] only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take
939987 [390] advantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles,
939987 [391] installments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience,
939987 [392] came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his
939987 [393] father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was
939987 [394] difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of
939987 [395] his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even
939987 [396] in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own
939987 [397] desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect
939987 [398] anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed,
939987 [399] suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed,
939987 [400] this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the
939987 [401] subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.
939987 [402] But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [403] other two sons, and of their origin.
939987 [404] 
939987 [405] 
939987 [406] 
939987 [407] Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family
939987 [408] 
939987 [409] 
939987 [410] Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor
939987 [411] Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years.
939987 [412] He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from
939987 [413] another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in
939987 [414] company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious
939987 [415] debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his
939987 [416] business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not
939987 [417] over-scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon,
939987 [418] and was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up in
939987 [419] the house of a generalâ€™s widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who
939987 [420] was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, but
939987 [421] I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, was
939987 [422] once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the
939987 [423] loft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting
939987 [424] nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had
939987 [425] become an insufferable tyrant through idleness.
939987 [426] 
939987 [427] Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and he
939987 [428] was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopement
939987 [429] to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would not on any
939987 [430] account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.
939987 [431] But she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl of
939987 [432] sixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom of
939987 [433] the river than remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child
939987 [434] exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a
939987 [435] penny this time, for the generalâ€™s widow was furious. She gave them
939987 [436] nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry; what
939987 [437] allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all her
939987 [438] innocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious
939987 [439] profligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine
939987 [440] beauty.
939987 [441] 
939987 [442] â€œThose innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,â€ he used to say
939987 [443] afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this might,
939987 [444] of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had received no
939987 [445] dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her â€œfrom the halter,â€ he
939987 [446] did not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel that she had â€œwrongedâ€
939987 [447] him, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to
939987 [448] trample on the elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women
939987 [449] into his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wifeâ€™s
939987 [450] presence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that
939987 [451] Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had
939987 [452] always hated his first mistress, AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna, took the side of his
939987 [453] new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a
939987 [454] manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels
939987 [455] and drove all the disorderly women out of the house. In the end this
939987 [456] unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that
939987 [457] kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women
939987 [458] who are said to be â€œpossessed by devils.â€ At times after terrible fits of
939987 [459] hysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two
939987 [460] sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the
939987 [461] second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth
939987 [462] year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all
939987 [463] his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same
939987 [464] thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.
939987 [465] They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were
939987 [466] looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were
939987 [467] found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was
939987 [468] still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done
939987 [469] her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofyaâ€™s
939987 [470] manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she
939987 [471] declared aloud two or three times to her retainers:
939987 [472] 
939987 [473] â€œIt serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.â€
939987 [474] 
939987 [475] Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovnaâ€™s death the generalâ€™s widow
939987 [476] suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [477] house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.
939987 [478] It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eight
939987 [479] years, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him,
939987 [480] without any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slaps
939987 [481] on the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times up
939987 [482] and down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to the
939987 [483] two boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in
939987 [484] dirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and
939987 [485] announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them
939987 [486] just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to her
939987 [487] own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word,
939987 [488] and when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow
939987 [489] and pronounced impressively that, â€œGod would repay her for the orphans.â€
939987 [490] â€œYou are a blockhead all the same,â€ the old lady shouted to him as she
939987 [491] drove away.
939987 [492] 
939987 [493] Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, and
939987 [494] did not refuse the generalâ€™s widow his formal consent to any proposition
939987 [495] in regard to his childrenâ€™s education. As for the slaps she had given him,
939987 [496] he drove all over the town telling the story.
939987 [497] 
939987 [498] It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the boys
939987 [499] in her will a thousand roubles each â€œfor their instruction, and so that
939987 [500] all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so
939987 [501] portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it is more than
939987 [502] adequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to throw
939987 [503] away their money, let them.â€ I have not read the will myself, but I heard
939987 [504] there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. The
939987 [505] principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the
939987 [506] province, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor
939987 [507] Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him
939987 [508] for his childrenâ€™s education (though the latter never directly refused but
939987 [509] only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was, indeed, at
939987 [510] times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interest
939987 [511] in the orphans. He became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, who
939987 [512] lived for a long while as one of his family. I beg the reader to note this
939987 [513] from the beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and
939987 [514] humanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted for
939987 [515] their education and bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand
939987 [516] roubles left to them by the generalâ€™s widow intact, so that by the time
939987 [517] they came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of
939987 [518] interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent
939987 [519] far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I wonâ€™t enter into a
939987 [520] detailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few
939987 [521] of the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he
939987 [522] grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. At
939987 [523] ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home
939987 [524] but on other peopleâ€™s charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
939987 [525] was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancy
939987 [526] (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for
939987 [527] learning. I donâ€™t know precisely why, but he left the family of Yefim
939987 [528] Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and
939987 [529] boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of
939987 [530] Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to
939987 [531] the â€œardor for good worksâ€ of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the
939987 [532] idea that the boyâ€™s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
939987 [533] neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man
939987 [534] finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch
939987 [535] had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old ladyâ€™s legacy,
939987 [536] which had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to
939987 [537] formalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits
939987 [538] for the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep
939987 [539] himself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not
939987 [540] even attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from
939987 [541] contempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him
939987 [542] that from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that may
939987 [543] have been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in
939987 [544] getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting
939987 [545] paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of
939987 [546] â€œEye-Witness.â€ These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting and
939987 [547] piquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young manâ€™s
939987 [548] practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and
939987 [549] unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the
939987 [550] newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than
939987 [551] everlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.
939987 [552] Having once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept
939987 [553] up his connection with them, and in his latter years at the university he
939987 [554] published brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
939987 [555] that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his last year
939987 [556] he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of
939987 [557] readers, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It was
939987 [558] rather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and was
939987 [559] preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch
939987 [560] published in one of the more important journals a strange article, which
939987 [561] attracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have been
939987 [562] supposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. The
939987 [563] article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the
939987 [564] timeâ€”the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several
939987 [565] opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most
939987 [566] striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion.
939987 [567] Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.
939987 [568] And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their
939987 [569] applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was
939987 [570] nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident
939987 [571] particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in
939987 [572] our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the
939987 [573] question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.
939987 [574] Learning the authorâ€™s name, they were interested in his being a native of
939987 [575] the town and the son of â€œthat Fyodor Pavlovitch.â€ And just then it was
939987 [576] that the author himself made his appearance among us.
939987 [577] 
939987 [578] Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the
939987 [579] time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first
939987 [580] step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.
939987 [581] It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud,
939987 [582] and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house
939987 [583] and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never
939987 [584] thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him
939987 [585] money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
939987 [586] also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the
939987 [587] house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they
939987 [588] were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of
939987 [589] wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov, of
939987 [590] whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s first wife,
939987 [591] happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had
939987 [592] come from Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was more
939987 [593] surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man, who
939987 [594] interested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not
939987 [595] without an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.
939987 [596] 
939987 [597] â€œHe is proud,â€ he used to say, â€œhe will never be in want of pence; he has
939987 [598] got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every one can
939987 [599] see that he hasnâ€™t come for money, for his father would never give him
939987 [600] any. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his father canâ€™t
939987 [601] do without him. They get on so well together!â€
939987 [602] 
939987 [603] That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over his
939987 [604] father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even
939987 [605] seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and even
939987 [606] spitefully perverse.
939987 [607] 
939987 [608] It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the request
939987 [609] of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he saw for
939987 [610] the first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving Moscow
939987 [611] been in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concern
939987 [612] to Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader will learn fully
939987 [613] in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still
939987 [614] felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit
939987 [615] rather mysterious.
939987 [616] 
939987 [617] I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator
939987 [618] between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel
939987 [619] with his father and even planning to bring an action against him.
939987 [620] 
939987 [621] The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its
939987 [622] members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,
939987 [623] Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the
939987 [624] three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to
939987 [625] speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of
939987 [626] him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce
939987 [627] my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been
939987 [628] for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered
939987 [629] there for the rest of his life.
939987 [630] 
939987 [631] 
939987 [632] 
939987 [633] Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha
939987 [634] 
939987 [635] 
939987 [636] He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at the
939987 [637] time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven. First of all, I
939987 [638] must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my
939987 [639] opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my full
939987 [640] opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and
939987 [641] that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it
939987 [642] struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from
939987 [643] the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason
939987 [644] this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as
939987 [645] he thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whom
939987 [646] he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart. But I
939987 [647] do not dispute that he was very strange even at that time, and had been so
939987 [648] indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned already, by the way, that though
939987 [649] he lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his lifeâ€”her
939987 [650] face, her caresses, â€œas though she stood living before me.â€ Such memories
939987 [651] may persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two
939987 [652] years old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots
939987 [653] of light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which
939987 [654] has all faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
939987 [655] with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the
939987 [656] slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all);
939987 [657] in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on
939987 [658] her knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and
939987 [659] moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,
939987 [660] and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both arms to
939987 [661] the image as though to put him under the Motherâ€™s protection ... and
939987 [662] suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the
939987 [663] picture! And Alyosha remembered his motherâ€™s face at that minute. He used
939987 [664] to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely
939987 [665] cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth he
939987 [666] was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness
939987 [667] or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different,
939987 [668] from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with
939987 [669] other people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, to
939987 [670] forget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed
939987 [671] throughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever
939987 [672] looked on him as a simpleton or naÃ¯ve person. There was something about
939987 [673] him which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards)
939987 [674] that he did not care to be a judge of othersâ€”that he would never take it
939987 [675] upon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. He
939987 [676] seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though
939987 [677] often grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could
939987 [678] surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty to
939987 [679] his fatherâ€™s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste
939987 [680] and pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on was
939987 [681] unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.
939987 [682] His father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so was
939987 [683] sensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and
939987 [684] sullenness. â€œHe does not say much,â€ he used to say, â€œand thinks the more.â€
939987 [685] But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissing
939987 [686] him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yet
939987 [687] he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had never
939987 [688] been capable of feeling for any one before.
939987 [689] 
939987 [690] Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was so
939987 [691] from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his patron
939987 [692] and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts of all the
939987 [693] family, so that they looked on him quite as their own child. Yet he
939987 [694] entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted from
939987 [695] design nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift of making
939987 [696] himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very
939987 [697] nature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he seemed to be
939987 [698] just one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and
939987 [699] even disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and
939987 [700] rather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into
939987 [701] a corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
939987 [702] at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at the
939987 [703] first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the contrary he was
939987 [704] bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off among his
939987 [705] schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never afraid of any one,
939987 [706] yet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his
939987 [707] fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous. He
939987 [708] never resented an insult. It would happen that an hour after the offense
939987 [709] he would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and
939987 [710] candid an expression as though nothing had happened between them. And it
939987 [711] was not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the
939987 [712] affront, but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this
939987 [713] completely conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
939987 [714] which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to
939987 [715] mock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. This
939987 [716] characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could not
939987 [717] bear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women. There
939987 [718] are â€œcertainâ€ words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in
939987 [719] schools. Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking
939987 [720] in school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and
939987 [721] images of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than
939987 [722] that, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to
939987 [723] quite young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
939987 [724] moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the
939987 [725] appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something
939987 [726] refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha
939987 [727] Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of â€œthat,â€ they
939987 [728] used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shout
939987 [729] nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor, tried
939987 [730] to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insults
939987 [731] in silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him with
939987 [732] being a â€œregular girl,â€ and whatâ€™s more they looked upon it with
939987 [733] compassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in the class but
939987 [734] was never first.
939987 [735] 
939987 [736] At the time of Yefim Petrovitchâ€™s death Alyosha had two more years to
939987 [737] complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went almost
939987 [738] immediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her whole
939987 [739] family, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to live in
939987 [740] the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had
939987 [741] never seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did not know
939987 [742] himself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at
939987 [743] whose expense he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to
939987 [744] his elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two years
939987 [745] in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had from
939987 [746] childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his
939987 [747] benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyoshaâ€™s character must not, I
939987 [748] think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance with
939987 [749] him any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths,
939987 [750] almost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to
939987 [751] come into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give it
939987 [752] away for the asking, either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue.
939987 [753] In general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course,
939987 [754] in a literal sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked
939987 [755] for, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a
939987 [756] moment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
939987 [757] 
939987 [758] In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov, a man very sensitive on the
939987 [759] score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment,
939987 [760] after getting to know Alyosha:
939987 [761] 
939987 [762] â€œHere is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone
939987 [763] without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million
939987 [764] inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold and
939987 [765] hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were not, he
939987 [766] would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort or
939987 [767] humiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on the contrary,
939987 [768] would probably be looked on as a pleasure.â€
939987 [769] 
939987 [770] He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end of
939987 [771] the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to see
939987 [772] his father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry and
939987 [773] unwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and the
939987 [774] ladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from his
939987 [775] benefactorâ€™s family. They provided him liberally with money and even
939987 [776] fitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the money
939987 [777] they gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival
939987 [778] in the town he made no answer to his fatherâ€™s first inquiry why he had
939987 [779] come before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
939987 [780] thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his motherâ€™s
939987 [781] tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only
939987 [782] object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.
939987 [783] It is more probable that he himself did not understand and could not
939987 [784] explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn him irresistibly
939987 [785] into a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show
939987 [786] him where his second wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave
939987 [787] since he had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had
939987 [788] entirely forgotten where she was buried.
939987 [789] 
939987 [790] Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been
939987 [791] living in our town. Three or four years after his wifeâ€™s death he had gone
939987 [792] to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he spent
939987 [793] several years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own words, â€œof a
939987 [794] lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,â€ and ended by being received by
939987 [795] â€œJews high and low alike.â€ It may be presumed that at this period he
939987 [796] developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money. He finally
939987 [797] returned to our town only three years before Alyoshaâ€™s arrival. His former
939987 [798] acquaintances found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means
939987 [799] an old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more
939987 [800] effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making
939987 [801] buffoons of others. His depravity with women was not simply what it used
939987 [802] to be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a great number
939987 [803] of new taverns in the district. It was evident that he had perhaps a
939987 [804] hundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of the inhabitants of the
939987 [805] town and district were soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good
939987 [806] security. Of late, too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more
939987 [807] irresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to
939987 [808] begin one thing and go on with another, as though he were letting himself
939987 [809] go altogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not
939987 [810] been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerably
939987 [811] too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, Fyodor
939987 [812] Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyoshaâ€™s arrival seemed
939987 [813] to affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in this
939987 [814] prematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.
939987 [815] 
939987 [816] â€œDo you know,â€ he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, â€œthat you are
939987 [817] like her, â€˜the crazy womanâ€™ â€â€”that was what he used to call his dead wife,
939987 [818] Alyoshaâ€™s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the â€œcrazy womanâ€™sâ€ grave
939987 [819] to Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remote
939987 [820] corner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which were
939987 [821] inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death, and
939987 [822] below a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned
939987 [823] middle-class tombs. To Alyoshaâ€™s amazement this tomb turned out to be
939987 [824] Grigoryâ€™s doing. He had put it up on the poor â€œcrazy womanâ€™sâ€ grave at his
939987 [825] own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about the
939987 [826] grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories.
939987 [827] Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his motherâ€™s grave.
939987 [828] He only listened to Grigoryâ€™s minute and solemn account of the erection of
939987 [829] the tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a
939987 [830] word. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this
939987 [831] little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€”and a
939987 [832] very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to
939987 [833] pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,
939987 [834] Alyoshaâ€™s mother, the â€œcrazy woman,â€ but for the first, AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna,
939987 [835] who used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and
939987 [836] abused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he
939987 [837] had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange
939987 [838] impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
939987 [839] 
939987 [840] I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at this
939987 [841] time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he
939987 [842] had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent,
939987 [843] suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in
939987 [844] his little fat face, the Adamâ€™s apple hung below his sharp chin like a
939987 [845] great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual
939987 [846] appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between
939987 [847] which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobbered
939987 [848] every time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his own
939987 [849] face, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it. He used
939987 [850] particularly to point to his nose, which was not very large, but very
939987 [851] delicate and conspicuously aquiline. â€œA regular Roman nose,â€ he used to
939987 [852] say, â€œwith my goiter Iâ€™ve quite the countenance of an ancient Roman
939987 [853] patrician of the decadent period.â€ He seemed proud of it.
939987 [854] 
939987 [855] Not long after visiting his motherâ€™s grave Alyosha suddenly announced that
939987 [856] he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing to
939987 [857] receive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong desire, and
939987 [858] that he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The old man knew
939987 [859] that the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, had
939987 [860] made a special impression upon his â€œgentle boy.â€
939987 [861] 
939987 [862] â€œThat is the most honest monk among them, of course,â€ he observed, after
939987 [863] listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprised
939987 [864] at his request. â€œHâ€™m!... So thatâ€™s where you want to be, my gentle boy?â€
939987 [865] 
939987 [866] He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken grin,
939987 [867] which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. â€œHâ€™m!... I had
939987 [868] a presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would you
939987 [869] believe it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you have
939987 [870] your own two thousand. Thatâ€™s a dowry for you. And Iâ€™ll never desert you,
939987 [871] my angel. And Iâ€™ll pay whatâ€™s wanted for you there, if they ask for it.
939987 [872] But, of course, if they donâ€™t ask, why should we worry them? What do you
939987 [873] say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. Hâ€™m!...
939987 [874] Do you know that near one monastery thereâ€™s a place outside the town where
939987 [875] every baby knows there are none but â€˜the monksâ€™ wivesâ€™ living, as they are
939987 [876] called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, itâ€™s
939987 [877] interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is
939987 [878] itâ€™s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they
939987 [879] could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear
939987 [880] of it theyâ€™ll come along. Well, thereâ€™s nothing of that sort here, no
939987 [881] â€˜monksâ€™ wives,â€™ and two hundred monks. Theyâ€™re honest. They keep the
939987 [882] fasts. I admit it.... Hâ€™m.... So you want to be a monk? And do you know
939987 [883] Iâ€™m sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, Iâ€™ve really grown
939987 [884] fond of you? Well, itâ€™s a good opportunity. Youâ€™ll pray for us sinners; we
939987 [885] have sinned too much here. Iâ€™ve always been thinking who would pray for
939987 [886] me, and whether thereâ€™s any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, Iâ€™m
939987 [887] awfully stupid about that. You wouldnâ€™t believe it. Awfully. You see,
939987 [888] however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinkingâ€”from time
939987 [889] to time, of course, not all the while. Itâ€™s impossible, I think, for the
939987 [890] devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. Then
939987 [891] I wonderâ€”hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do
939987 [892] they forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in the
939987 [893] monastery probably believe that thereâ€™s a ceiling in hell, for instance.
939987 [894] Now Iâ€™m ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it more
939987 [895] refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after all, what
939987 [896] does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasnâ€™t? But, do you know,
939987 [897] thereâ€™s a damnable question involved in it? If thereâ€™s no ceiling there
939987 [898] can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which is
939987 [899] unlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me down to hell, and
939987 [900] if they donâ€™t drag me down what justice is there in the world? _Il
939987 [901] faudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if you
939987 [902] only knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.â€
939987 [903] 
939987 [904] â€œBut there are no hooks there,â€ said Alyosha, looking gently and seriously
939987 [905] at his father.
939987 [906] 
939987 [907] â€œYes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. Thatâ€™s how a
939987 [908] Frenchman described hell: â€˜_Jâ€™ai bu lâ€™ombre dâ€™un cocher qui avec lâ€™ombre
939987 [909] dâ€™une brosse frottait lâ€™ombre dâ€™une carrosse._â€™ How do you know there are
939987 [910] no hooks, darling? When youâ€™ve lived with the monks youâ€™ll sing a
939987 [911] different tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tell
939987 [912] me. Anyway itâ€™s easier going to the other world if one knows what there is
939987 [913] there. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here
939987 [914] with me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though youâ€™re like
939987 [915] an angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch you
939987 [916] there. Thatâ€™s why I let you go, because I hope for that. Youâ€™ve got all
939987 [917] your wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will be
939987 [918] healed and come back again. And I will wait for you. I feel that youâ€™re
939987 [919] the only creature in the world who has not condemned me. My dear boy, I
939987 [920] feel it, you know. I canâ€™t help feeling it.â€
939987 [921] 
939987 [922] And he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked and
939987 [923] sentimental.
939987 [924] 
939987 [925] 
939987 [926] 
939987 [927] Chapter V. Elders
939987 [928] 
939987 [929] 
939987 [930] Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic,
939987 [931] poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On the contrary,
939987 [932] Alyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of
939987 [933] nineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome, too, graceful,
939987 [934] moderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long,
939987 [935] oval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he was very
939987 [936] thoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red
939987 [937] cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy
939987 [938] that Alyosha was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the
939987 [939] monastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are
939987 [940] never a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
939987 [941] realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
939987 [942] always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if
939987 [943] he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather
939987 [944] disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he
939987 [945] admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does
939987 [946] not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.
939987 [947] If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to
939987 [948] admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not
939987 [949] believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, â€œMy Lord and my God!â€
939987 [950] Was it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed
939987 [951] solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his
939987 [952] secret heart even when he said, â€œI do not believe till I see.â€
939987 [953] 
939987 [954] I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had not
939987 [955] finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies is
939987 [956] true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
939987 [957] Iâ€™ll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path only
939987 [958] because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and presented
939987 [959] itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul from
939987 [960] darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of our
939987 [961] last epochâ€”that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for it
939987 [962] and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength
939987 [963] of his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice
939987 [964] everything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily fail to
939987 [965] understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest of
939987 [966] all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years of
939987 [967] their seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiply
939987 [968] tenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set
939987 [969] before them as their goalâ€”such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength
939987 [970] of many of them. The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite
939987 [971] direction, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As
939987 [972] soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God
939987 [973] and immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: â€œI want to
939987 [974] live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.â€ In the same way,
939987 [975] if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at once
939987 [976] have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely the
939987 [977] labor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the
939987 [978] question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower of
939987 [979] Babel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up
939987 [980] heaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go
939987 [981] on living as before. It is written: â€œGive all that thou hast to the poor
939987 [982] and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.â€
939987 [983] 
939987 [984] Alyosha said to himself: â€œI canâ€™t give two roubles instead of â€˜all,â€™ and
939987 [985] only go to mass instead of â€˜following Him.â€™ â€ Perhaps his memories of
939987 [986] childhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have taken
939987 [987] him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his
939987 [988] poor â€œcrazyâ€ mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination.
939987 [989] Brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see
939987 [990] whether here he could sacrifice all or only â€œtwo roubles,â€ and in the
939987 [991] monastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what an â€œelderâ€ is
939987 [992] in Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent
939987 [993] to do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a
939987 [994] few words. Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of
939987 [995] â€œeldersâ€ is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our
939987 [996] monasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos,
939987 [997] it has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
939987 [998] ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
939987 [999] Russiaâ€”the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the East
939987 [1000] after the destruction of Constantinopleâ€”this institution fell into
939987 [1001] oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end of last century by one
939987 [1002] of the great â€œascetics,â€ as they called him, PaÃ¯ssy Velitchkovsky, and his
939987 [1003] disciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and has
939987 [1004] sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It flourished
939987 [1005] especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was
939987 [1006] introduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three
939987 [1007] such elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying of
939987 [1008] weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The question
939987 [1009] for our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguished
939987 [1010] by anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints,
939987 [1011] nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical
939987 [1012] exploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its
939987 [1013] elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles
939987 [1014] from all parts.
939987 [1015] 
939987 [1016] What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,
939987 [1017] into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your
939987 [1018] own will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete
939987 [1019] self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is
939987 [1020] undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, in
939987 [1021] order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from
939987 [1022] self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without
939987 [1023] finding their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is not
939987 [1024] founded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of a
939987 [1025] thousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary
939987 [1026] â€œobedienceâ€ which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
939987 [1027] obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
939987 [1028] themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them.
939987 [1029] 
939987 [1030] The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
939987 [1031] one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his
939987 [1032] elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after great
939987 [1033] exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyrâ€™s
939987 [1034] death for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, was
939987 [1035] burying him, suddenly, at the deaconâ€™s exhortation, â€œDepart all ye
939987 [1036] unbaptized,â€ the coffin containing the martyrâ€™s body left its place and
939987 [1037] was cast forth from the church, and this took place three times. And only
939987 [1038] at last they learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and
939987 [1039] left his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elderâ€™s
939987 [1040] absolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral
939987 [1041] take place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
939987 [1042] instance.
939987 [1043] 
939987 [1044] A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he loved
939987 [1045] as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem to
939987 [1046] do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:
939987 [1047] â€œThere is the place for thee and not here.â€ The monk, overwhelmed with
939987 [1048] sorrow, went to the Å’cumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought
939987 [1049] him to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not
939987 [1050] only was he unable to release him, but there was not and could not be on
939987 [1051] earth a power which could release him except the elder who had himself
939987 [1052] laid that duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain
939987 [1053] cases with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many of
939987 [1054] our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
939987 [1055] persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed
939987 [1056] among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men of
939987 [1057] distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery to
939987 [1058] confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask for
939987 [1059] counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declared
939987 [1060] that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously
939987 [1061] degraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the
939987 [1062] monk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In the
939987 [1063] end, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming
939987 [1064] established in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this
939987 [1065] instrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral
939987 [1066] regeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility
939987 [1067] may be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
939987 [1068] complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondage
939987 [1069] and not to freedom.
939987 [1070] 
939987 [1071] The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners, had
939987 [1072] been in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.
939987 [1073] He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul.
939987 [1074] Alyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and let
939987 [1075] him wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no
939987 [1076] obligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days.
939987 [1077] Though he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different
939987 [1078] from others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination
939987 [1079] was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that so
939987 [1080] many people had for years past come to confess their sins to Father
939987 [1081] Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he had
939987 [1082] acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a
939987 [1083] new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his conscience. He
939987 [1084] sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of
939987 [1085] their secrets before they had spoken a word.
939987 [1086] 
939987 [1087] Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first
939987 [1088] time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy
939987 [1089] faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was
939987 [1090] not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks
939987 [1091] used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the
939987 [1092] greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the
939987 [1093] end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
939987 [1094] were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of
939987 [1095] great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks
939987 [1096] distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the
939987 [1097] majority were on Father Zossimaâ€™s side and very many of them loved him
939987 [1098] with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically
939987 [1099] devoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint,
939987 [1100] that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near,
939987 [1101] they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the
939987 [1102] immediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the
939987 [1103] miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the
939987 [1104] story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with
939987 [1105] sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and
939987 [1106] to pray over them, return shortly afterâ€”some the next dayâ€”and, falling in
939987 [1107] tears at the elderâ€™s feet, thank him for healing their sick.
939987 [1108] 
939987 [1109] Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural
939987 [1110] course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for
939987 [1111] he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in
939987 [1112] his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His heart
939987 [1113] throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out to
939987 [1114] the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the
939987 [1115] humbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to see
939987 [1116] the elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissed
939987 [1117] his feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the women
939987 [1118] held up their children to him and brought him the sick â€œpossessed with
939987 [1119] devils.â€ The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed
939987 [1120] them, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks of
939987 [1121] illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrims
939987 [1122] waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder why
939987 [1123] they loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotion
939987 [1124] merely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of
939987 [1125] the Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the
939987 [1126] everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the worldâ€™s, it was
939987 [1127] the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall
939987 [1128] down before and worship.
939987 [1129] 
939987 [1130] â€œAmong us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere on
939987 [1131] earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows the
939987 [1132] truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us,
939987 [1133] too, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.â€
939987 [1134] 
939987 [1135] Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. He
939987 [1136] understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian of
939987 [1137] Godâ€™s truthâ€”of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the
939987 [1138] sick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction that
939987 [1139] after his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery
939987 [1140] was even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind
939987 [1141] of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart.
939987 [1142] He was not at all troubled at this elderâ€™s standing as a solitary example
939987 [1143] before him.
939987 [1144] 
939987 [1145] â€œNo matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal for
939987 [1146] all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and all
939987 [1147] men will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich nor
939987 [1148] poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, and
939987 [1149] the true Kingdom of Christ will come.â€ That was the dream in Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [1150] heart.
939987 [1151] 
939987 [1152] The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then, seemed
939987 [1153] to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made friends with
939987 [1154] his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than with his own
939987 [1155] brother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but when
939987 [1156] the latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairly
939987 [1157] often, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he
939987 [1158] seemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his
939987 [1159] brother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
939987 [1160] curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyosha
939987 [1161] noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brotherâ€™s indifference
939987 [1162] at first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wondered
939987 [1163] whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some
939987 [1164] other cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was
939987 [1165] absorbed in somethingâ€”something inward and importantâ€”that he was striving
939987 [1166] towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he
939987 [1167] had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some
939987 [1168] contempt on the part of the learned atheist for himâ€”a foolish novice. He
939987 [1169] knew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take
939987 [1170] offense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment
939987 [1171] which he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come
939987 [1172] nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and
939987 [1173] with a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of
939987 [1174] the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
939987 [1175] bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitriâ€™s enthusiastic references to
939987 [1176] Ivan were the more striking in Alyoshaâ€™s eyes since Dmitri was, compared
939987 [1177] with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in
939987 [1178] personality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more
939987 [1179] unlike.
939987 [1180] 
939987 [1181] It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members
939987 [1182] of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had
939987 [1183] such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gathering
939987 [1184] was a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and
939987 [1185] his father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become
939987 [1186] insufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to
939987 [1187] suggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossimaâ€™s
939987 [1188] cell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might
939987 [1189] more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of
939987 [1190] the elderâ€™s presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally
939987 [1191] supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretly
939987 [1192] blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several
939987 [1193] recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he was
939987 [1194] not, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other end
939987 [1195] of the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov, who was staying
939987 [1196] in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the
939987 [1197] forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by
939987 [1198] boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with
939987 [1199] the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the
939987 [1200] monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the
939987 [1201] Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with
939987 [1202] such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and
939987 [1203] consideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from
939987 [1204] within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had
939987 [1205] scarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his
939987 [1206] ordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was
939987 [1207] fixed.
939987 [1208] 
939987 [1209] â€œWho has made me a judge over them?â€ was all he said, smilingly, to
939987 [1210] Alyosha.
939987 [1211] 
939987 [1212] Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the
939987 [1213] wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the
939987 [1214] interview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives,
939987 [1215] perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and
939987 [1216] MiÃ¼sov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his
939987 [1217] father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said
939987 [1218] nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was
939987 [1219] far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with
939987 [1220] a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the family
939987 [1221] discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety concerned the elder. He
939987 [1222] trembled for him, for his glory, and dreaded any affront to him,
939987 [1223] especially the refined, courteous irony of MiÃ¼sov and the supercilious
939987 [1224] half-utterances of the highly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture on
939987 [1225] warning the elder, telling him something about them, but, on second
939987 [1226] thoughts, said nothing. He only sent word the day before, through a
939987 [1227] friend, to his brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep
939987 [1228] his promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had
939987 [1229] promised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let
939987 [1230] himself be provoked â€œby vileness,â€ but that, although he had a deep
939987 [1231] respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that the
939987 [1232] meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.
939987 [1233] 
939987 [1234] â€œNevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respect
939987 [1235] to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,â€ he wrote in conclusion.
939987 [1236] Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.

939987 [1245] Chapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery
939987 [1246] 
939987 [1247] 
939987 [1248] It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with the
939987 [1249] elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass.
939987 [1250] Our visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it was
939987 [1251] over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove
939987 [1252] up with MiÃ¼sov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty,
939987 [1253] called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter the
939987 [1254] university. MiÃ¼sov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to
939987 [1255] persuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young
939987 [1256] man was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was
939987 [1257] nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixity
939987 [1258] in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he would
939987 [1259] sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and rather
939987 [1260] awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he became
939987 [1261] talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But his
939987 [1262] animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and even
939987 [1263] elaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and
939987 [1264] expectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyoshaâ€™s.
939987 [1265] 
939987 [1266] In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old
939987 [1267] pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind MiÃ¼sovâ€™s carriage, came Fyodor
939987 [1268] Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been
939987 [1269] informed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriage
939987 [1270] at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the
939987 [1271] monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever
939987 [1272] seen the monastery, and MiÃ¼sov had probably not even been to church for
939987 [1273] thirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumed
939987 [1274] ease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these too
939987 [1275] were ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the
939987 [1276] monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church,
939987 [1277] bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few of
939987 [1278] higher rankâ€”two or three ladies and a very old general. They were all
939987 [1279] staying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, but
939987 [1280] none of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took a
939987 [1281] ten-copeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassedâ€”God knows
939987 [1282] why!â€”hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: â€œDivide it equally.â€ None
939987 [1283] of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to be
939987 [1284] embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.
939987 [1285] 
939987 [1286] It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they
939987 [1287] were not received with special honor, though one of them had recently made
939987 [1288] a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy and
939987 [1289] highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense
939987 [1290] dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their
939987 [1291] fishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.
939987 [1292] 
939987 [1293] MiÃ¼sov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and was
939987 [1294] on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty
939987 [1295] penny for the right of lying in this â€œholy place,â€ but refrained. His
939987 [1296] liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.
939987 [1297] 
939987 [1298] â€œWho the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out,
939987 [1299] for time is passing,â€ he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.
939987 [1300] 
939987 [1301] All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating
939987 [1302] little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, he
939987 [1303] introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula. He
939987 [1304] at once entered into our visitorsâ€™ difficulty.
939987 [1305] 
939987 [1306] â€œFather Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from the
939987 [1307] monastery, the other side of the copse.â€
939987 [1308] 
939987 [1309] â€œI know itâ€™s the other side of the copse,â€ observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [1310] â€œbut we donâ€™t remember the way. It is a long time since weâ€™ve been here.â€
939987 [1311] 
939987 [1312] â€œThis way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Come
939987 [1313] with me, wonâ€™t you? Iâ€™ll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself.
939987 [1314] This way, this way.â€
939987 [1315] 
939987 [1316] They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man of
939987 [1317] sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, with
939987 [1318] an incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out of
939987 [1319] his head.
939987 [1320] 
939987 [1321] â€œYou see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,â€ observed
939987 [1322] MiÃ¼sov severely. â€œThat personage has granted us an audience, so to speak,
939987 [1323] and so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you to
939987 [1324] accompany us.â€
939987 [1325] 
939987 [1326] â€œIâ€™ve been there. Iâ€™ve been already; _un chevalier parfait_,â€ and Maximov
939987 [1327] snapped his fingers in the air.
939987 [1328] 
939987 [1329] â€œWho is a _chevalier_?â€ asked MiÃ¼sov.
939987 [1330] 
939987 [1331] â€œThe elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the
939987 [1332] monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!â€
939987 [1333] 
939987 [1334] But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk of
939987 [1335] medium height, wearing a monkâ€™s cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [1336] and MiÃ¼sov stopped.
939987 [1337] 
939987 [1338] The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:
939987 [1339] 
939987 [1340] â€œThe Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after
939987 [1341] your visit to the hermitage. At one oâ€™clock, not later. And you also,â€ he
939987 [1342] added, addressing Maximov.
939987 [1343] 
939987 [1344] â€œThat I certainly will, without fail,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely
939987 [1345] delighted at the invitation. â€œAnd, believe me, weâ€™ve all given our word to
939987 [1346] behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?â€
939987 [1347] 
939987 [1348] â€œYes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here?
939987 [1349] The only obstacle to me is your company....â€
939987 [1350] 
939987 [1351] â€œYes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.â€
939987 [1352] 
939987 [1353] â€œIt would be a capital thing if he didnâ€™t turn up. Do you suppose I like
939987 [1354] all this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner.
939987 [1355] Thank the Father Superior,â€ he said to the monk.
939987 [1356] 
939987 [1357] â€œNo, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,â€ answered the monk.
939987 [1358] 
939987 [1359] â€œIf so Iâ€™ll go straight to the Father Superiorâ€”to the Father Superior,â€
939987 [1360] babbled Maximov.
939987 [1361] 
939987 [1362] â€œThe Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you pleaseâ€”â€ the monk
939987 [1363] hesitated.
939987 [1364] 
939987 [1365] â€œImpertinent old man!â€ MiÃ¼sov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to
939987 [1366] the monastery.
939987 [1367] 
939987 [1368] â€œHeâ€™s like von Sohn,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
939987 [1369] 
939987 [1370] â€œIs that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Have
939987 [1371] you ever seen von Sohn?â€
939987 [1372] 
939987 [1373] â€œIâ€™ve seen his portrait. Itâ€™s not the features, but something indefinable.
939987 [1374] Heâ€™s a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.â€
939987 [1375] 
939987 [1376] â€œAh, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor
939987 [1377] Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave
939987 [1378] properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin
939987 [1379] to play the fool I donâ€™t intend to be associated with you here.... You see
939987 [1380] what a man he isâ€â€”he turned to the monkâ€”â€œIâ€™m afraid to go among decent
939987 [1381] people with him.â€ A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to
939987 [1382] the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and was
939987 [1383] evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. MiÃ¼sov frowned more than
939987 [1384] ever.
939987 [1385] 
939987 [1386] â€œOh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, and
939987 [1387] nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,â€ flashed through
939987 [1388] MiÃ¼sovâ€™s mind.
939987 [1389] 
939987 [1390] â€œHereâ€™s the hermitage. Weâ€™ve arrived,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. â€œThe gates
939987 [1391] are shut.â€
939987 [1392] 
939987 [1393] And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above
939987 [1394] and on the sides of the gates.
939987 [1395] 
939987 [1396] â€œWhen you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitage
939987 [1397] there are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, and
939987 [1398] eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. Thatâ€™s what is
939987 [1399] remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives
939987 [1400] ladies,â€ he remarked suddenly to the monk.
939987 [1401] 
939987 [1402] â€œWomen of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting.
939987 [1403] But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the
939987 [1404] portico, but outside the precinctsâ€”you can see the windowsâ€”and the elder
939987 [1405] goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They are
939987 [1406] always outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,
939987 [1407] waiting there now with her sick daughter. Probably he has promised to come
939987 [1408] out to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown
939987 [1409] himself even to the people.â€
939987 [1410] 
939987 [1411] â€œSo then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage to
939987 [1412] the ladies. Donâ€™t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do you
939987 [1413] know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but no
939987 [1414] creature of the female sexâ€”no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.â€
939987 [1415] 
939987 [1416] â€œFyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. Theyâ€™ll
939987 [1417] turn you out when Iâ€™m gone.â€
939987 [1418] 
939987 [1419] â€œBut Iâ€™m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,â€ he cried
939987 [1420] suddenly, stepping within the precincts, â€œwhat a vale of roses they live
939987 [1421] in!â€
939987 [1422] 
939987 [1423] Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautiful
939987 [1424] autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidently
939987 [1425] tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, and
939987 [1426] between the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived
939987 [1427] was also surrounded with flowers.
939987 [1428] 
939987 [1429] â€œAnd was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didnâ€™t
939987 [1430] care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladies
939987 [1431] with a stick,â€ observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.
939987 [1432] 
939987 [1433] â€œThe elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great deal
939987 [1434] thatâ€™s told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,â€ answered the monk.
939987 [1435] â€œNow, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.â€
939987 [1436] 
939987 [1437] â€œFyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behave
939987 [1438] properly or I will pay you out!â€ MiÃ¼sov had time to mutter again.
939987 [1439] 
939987 [1440] â€œI canâ€™t think why you are so agitated,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch observed
939987 [1441] sarcastically. â€œAre you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell by
939987 [1442] oneâ€™s eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their
939987 [1443] opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. Iâ€™m surprised at you.â€
939987 [1444] 
939987 [1445] But MiÃ¼sov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to come
939987 [1446] in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.
939987 [1447] 
939987 [1448] â€œNow, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to
939987 [1449] quarrelâ€”and lower myself and my ideas,â€ he reflected.
939987 [1450] 
939987 [1451] 
939987 [1452] 
939987 [1453] Chapter II. The Old Buffoon
939987 [1454] 
939987 [1455] 
939987 [1456] They entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in
939987 [1457] from his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, two
939987 [1458] monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other Father
939987 [1459] PaÃ¯ssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though not
939987 [1460] old. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty,
939987 [1461] standing in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh
939987 [1462] face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary
939987 [1463] dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of the
939987 [1464] monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,
939987 [1465] reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an
939987 [1466] equality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.
939987 [1467] 
939987 [1468] Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks
939987 [1469] rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their
939987 [1470] fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as
939987 [1471] deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was
939987 [1472] performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an
939987 [1473] everyday rite. But MiÃ¼sov fancied that it was all done with intentional
939987 [1474] impressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He oughtâ€”he had
939987 [1475] reflected upon it the evening beforeâ€”from simple politeness, since it was
939987 [1476] the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elderâ€™s blessing, even if
939987 [1477] he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on
939987 [1478] the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified
939987 [1479] gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a
939987 [1480] chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking MiÃ¼sov like an ape. Ivan
939987 [1481] bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his
939987 [1482] sides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The
939987 [1483] elder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again,
939987 [1484] asked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyoshaâ€™s cheeks. He was
939987 [1485] ashamed. His forebodings were coming true.
939987 [1486] 
939987 [1487] Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, covered
939987 [1488] with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite
939987 [1489] wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monks
939987 [1490] sat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student,
939987 [1491] the novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large and
939987 [1492] had a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture,
939987 [1493] of coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window,
939987 [1494] and a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon
939987 [1495] of the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures in
939987 [1496] shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic
939987 [1497] cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign
939987 [1498] engravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to these
939987 [1499] costly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints
939987 [1500] of saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the
939987 [1501] fairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and
939987 [1502] present.
939987 [1503] 
939987 [1504] MiÃ¼sov took a cursory glance at all these â€œconventionalâ€ surroundings and
939987 [1505] bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his own
939987 [1506] insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which a
939987 [1507] clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking
939987 [1508] himself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima.
939987 [1509] There was, indeed, something in the elderâ€™s face which many people besides
939987 [1510] MiÃ¼sov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very
939987 [1511] weak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years
939987 [1512] older. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,
939987 [1513] particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,
939987 [1514] quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of gray
939987 [1515] hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and his
939987 [1516] lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads. His nose was
939987 [1517] not long, but sharp, like a birdâ€™s beak.
939987 [1518] 
939987 [1519] â€œTo all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,â€ thought
939987 [1520] MiÃ¼sov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
939987 [1521] 
939987 [1522] A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to
939987 [1523] begin the conversation.
939987 [1524] 
939987 [1525] â€œPrecisely to our time,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, â€œbut no sign of my son,
939987 [1526] Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!â€ (Alyosha shuddered all over at
939987 [1527] â€œsacred elder.â€) â€œI am always punctual myself, minute for minute,
939987 [1528] remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....â€
939987 [1529] 
939987 [1530] â€œBut you are not a king, anyway,â€ MiÃ¼sov muttered, losing his
939987 [1531] self-restraint at once.
939987 [1532] 
939987 [1533] â€œYes; thatâ€™s true. Iâ€™m not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr
939987 [1534] Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say the
939987 [1535] wrong thing. Your reverence,â€ he cried, with sudden pathos, â€œyou behold
939987 [1536] before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. Itâ€™s an old
939987 [1537] habit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place itâ€™s with an
939987 [1538] object, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. One
939987 [1539] must be agreeable, mustnâ€™t one? I was seven years ago in a little town
939987 [1540] where I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We
939987 [1541] went to the captain of police because we had to see him about something,
939987 [1542] and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, the
939987 [1543] most dangerous type in such cases. Itâ€™s their liver. I went straight up to
939987 [1544] him, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, â€˜Mr. Ispravnik,â€™
939987 [1545] said I, â€˜be our Napravnik.â€™ â€˜What do you mean by Napravnik?â€™ said he. I
939987 [1546] saw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there so
939987 [1547] glum. â€˜I wanted to make a joke,â€™ said I, â€˜for the general diversion, as
939987 [1548] Mr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we
939987 [1549] need for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.â€™ And I
939987 [1550] explained my comparison very reasonably, didnâ€™t I? â€˜Excuse me,â€™ said he,
939987 [1551] â€˜I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.â€™ He
939987 [1552] turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, â€˜Yes, yes, you are an
939987 [1553] Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.â€™ â€˜No,â€™ he said, â€˜since you called me a
939987 [1554] Napravnik I am one.â€™ And would you believe it, it ruined our business! And
939987 [1555] Iâ€™m always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with my
939987 [1556] politeness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: â€˜Your
939987 [1557] wife is a ticklish lady,â€™ in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities,
939987 [1558] so to speak. But he asked me, â€˜Why, have you tickled her?â€™ I thought Iâ€™d
939987 [1559] be polite, so I couldnâ€™t help saying, â€˜Yes,â€™ and he gave me a fine
939987 [1560] tickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so Iâ€™m not ashamed to
939987 [1561] tell the story. Iâ€™m always injuring myself like that.â€
939987 [1562] 
939987 [1563] â€œYouâ€™re doing it now,â€ muttered MiÃ¼sov, with disgust.
939987 [1564] 
939987 [1565] Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
939987 [1566] 
939987 [1567] â€œAm I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr
939987 [1568] Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon as
939987 [1569] I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that youâ€™d be the first
939987 [1570] to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isnâ€™t coming off, your
939987 [1571] reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower
939987 [1572] jaw and there is almost a spasm in them. Thatâ€™s been so since I was young,
939987 [1573] when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemenâ€™s families. I am an
939987 [1574] inveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, itâ€™s as
939987 [1575] though it were a craze in me. I dare say itâ€™s a devil within me. But only
939987 [1576] a little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But
939987 [1577] not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; youâ€™re not a lodging worth having
939987 [1578] either. But I do believeâ€”I believe in God, though I have had doubts of
939987 [1579] late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. Iâ€™m like the philosopher,
939987 [1580] Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot
939987 [1581] went to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?
939987 [1582] He went in and said straight out, â€˜There is no God.â€™ To which the great
939987 [1583] bishop lifted up his finger and answered, â€˜The fool hath said in his heart
939987 [1584] there is no God.â€™ And he fell down at his feet on the spot. â€˜I believe,â€™
939987 [1585] he cried, â€˜and will be christened.â€™ And so he was. Princess Dashkov was
939987 [1586] his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.â€
939987 [1587] 
939987 [1588] â€œFyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know youâ€™re telling lies and
939987 [1589] that that stupid anecdote isnâ€™t true. Why are you playing the fool?â€ cried
939987 [1590] MiÃ¼sov in a shaking voice.
939987 [1591] 
939987 [1592] â€œI suspected all my life that it wasnâ€™t true,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch cried
939987 [1593] with conviction. â€œBut Iâ€™ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great
939987 [1594] elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderotâ€™s christening I made up
939987 [1595] just now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I
939987 [1596] play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though I
939987 [1597] really donâ€™t know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot,
939987 [1598] I heard as far as â€˜the fool hath said in his heartâ€™ twenty times from the
939987 [1599] gentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr
939987 [1600] Alexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that the
939987 [1601] infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan
939987 [1602] Platon....â€
939987 [1603] 
939987 [1604] MiÃ¼sov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, and
939987 [1605] conscious of being ridiculous.
939987 [1606] 
939987 [1607] What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty or
939987 [1608] fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had entered
939987 [1609] that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every one
939987 [1610] admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Many
939987 [1611] remained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had been
939987 [1612] men of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted by
939987 [1613] curiosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence
939987 [1614] and delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on the
939987 [1615] one side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to
939987 [1616] decide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed
939987 [1617] and bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with
939987 [1618] unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the
939987 [1619] elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like MiÃ¼sov.
939987 [1620] Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed to
939987 [1621] him strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he had
939987 [1622] rested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that he
939987 [1623] could have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes,
939987 [1624] apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had
939987 [1625] nothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the
939987 [1626] divinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the
939987 [1627] monastery knew Rakitinâ€™s thoughts.
939987 [1628] 
939987 [1629] â€œForgive me,â€ began MiÃ¼sov, addressing Father Zossima, â€œfor perhaps I seem
939987 [1630] to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in believing
939987 [1631] that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on a
939987 [1632] visit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I should have to
939987 [1633] apologize simply for having come with him....â€
939987 [1634] 
939987 [1635] Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room,
939987 [1636] overwhelmed with confusion.
939987 [1637] 
939987 [1638] â€œDonâ€™t distress yourself, I beg.â€ The elder got on to his feeble legs, and
939987 [1639] taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again. â€œI beg
939987 [1640] you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest.â€ And
939987 [1641] with a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa.
939987 [1642] 
939987 [1643] â€œGreat elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [1644] cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as though
939987 [1645] ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
939987 [1646] 
939987 [1647] â€œI earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,â€
939987 [1648] the elder said impressively. â€œDo not trouble. Make yourself quite at home.
939987 [1649] And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root
939987 [1650] of it all.â€
939987 [1651] 
939987 [1652] â€œQuite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I
939987 [1653] accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, youâ€™d better not
939987 [1654] invite me to be my natural self. Donâ€™t risk it.... I will not go so far as
939987 [1655] that myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged
939987 [1656] in the mists of uncertainty, though there are people whoâ€™d be pleased to
939987 [1657] describe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for
939987 [1658] you, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.â€
939987 [1659] 
939987 [1660] He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, â€œBlessed be the womb that
939987 [1661] bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suckâ€”the paps especially. When you
939987 [1662] said just now, â€˜Donâ€™t be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root
939987 [1663] of it all,â€™ you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me to
939987 [1664] the core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than
939987 [1665] all, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, â€˜Let me really
939987 [1666] play the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one
939987 [1667] of you worse than I am.â€™ That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame,
939987 [1668] great elder, from shame; itâ€™s simply over-sensitiveness that makes me
939987 [1669] rowdy. If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the
939987 [1670] kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have been
939987 [1671] then! Teacher!â€ he fell suddenly on his knees, â€œwhat must I do to gain
939987 [1672] eternal life?â€
939987 [1673] 
939987 [1674] It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.
939987 [1675] 
939987 [1676] Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:
939987 [1677] 
939987 [1678] â€œYou have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough:
939987 [1679] donâ€™t give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; donâ€™t give way
939987 [1680] to sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. And close your
939987 [1681] taverns. If you canâ€™t close all, at least two or three. And, above
939987 [1682] allâ€”donâ€™t lie.â€
939987 [1683] 
939987 [1684] â€œYou mean about Diderot?â€
939987 [1685] 
939987 [1686] â€œNo, not about Diderot. Above all, donâ€™t lie to yourself. The man who lies
939987 [1687] to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot
939987 [1688] distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect
939987 [1689] for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and
939987 [1690] in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to
939987 [1691] passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all
939987 [1692] from continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to
939987 [1693] himself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimes
939987 [1694] very pleasant to take offense, isnâ€™t it? A man may know that nobody has
939987 [1695] insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied
939987 [1696] and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a
939987 [1697] mountain out of a molehillâ€”he knows that himself, yet he will be the first
939987 [1698] to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great
939987 [1699] pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit
939987 [1700] down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....â€
939987 [1701] 
939987 [1702] â€œBlessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.â€
939987 [1703] 
939987 [1704] Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elderâ€™s
939987 [1705] thin hand. â€œIt is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well,
939987 [1706] as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking offense,
939987 [1707] to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not so
939987 [1708] much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insultedâ€”that you had
939987 [1709] forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a note of that.
939987 [1710] But I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day and
939987 [1711] hour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though I
939987 [1712] believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say,
939987 [1713] the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may
939987 [1714] sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a
939987 [1715] word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had
939987 [1716] been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to
939987 [1717] find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me.
939987 [1718] Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told
939987 [1719] somewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his
939987 [1720] faith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his
939987 [1721] head, and, â€˜courteously kissing it,â€™ walked a long way, carrying it in his
939987 [1722] hands. Is that true or not, honored Father?â€
939987 [1723] 
939987 [1724] â€œNo, it is untrue,â€ said the elder.
939987 [1725] 
939987 [1726] â€œThere is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint
939987 [1727] do you say the story is told of?â€ asked the Father Librarian.
939987 [1728] 
939987 [1729] â€œI do not know what saint. I do not know, and canâ€™t tell. I was deceived.
939987 [1730] I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr
939987 [1731] Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it
939987 [1732] was who told the story.â€
939987 [1733] 
939987 [1734] â€œI have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.â€
939987 [1735] 
939987 [1736] â€œIt is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It
939987 [1737] was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you
939987 [1738] shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I went
939987 [1739] home with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shaken
939987 [1740] ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall.
939987 [1741] That was not a Diderot!â€
939987 [1742] 
939987 [1743] Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clear
939987 [1744] to every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet MiÃ¼sov was stung
939987 [1745] by his words.
939987 [1746] 
939987 [1747] â€œWhat nonsense, and it is all nonsense,â€ he muttered. â€œI may really have
939987 [1748] told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself. I
939987 [1749] heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at our mass
939987 [1750] from the _Lives of the Saints_ ... he was a very learned man who had made
939987 [1751] a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in
939987 [1752] Russia.... I have not read the _Lives of the Saints_ myself, and I am not
939987 [1753] going to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinnerâ€”we were
939987 [1754] dining then.â€
939987 [1755] 
939987 [1756] â€œYes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!â€ said Fyodor
939987 [1757] Pavlovitch, mimicking him.
939987 [1758] 
939987 [1759] â€œWhat do I care for your faith?â€ MiÃ¼sov was on the point of shouting, but
939987 [1760] he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, â€œYou defile
939987 [1761] everything you touch.â€
939987 [1762] 
939987 [1763] The elder suddenly rose from his seat. â€œExcuse me, gentlemen, for leaving
939987 [1764] you a few minutes,â€ he said, addressing all his guests. â€œI have visitors
939987 [1765] awaiting me who arrived before you. But donâ€™t you tell lies all the same,â€
939987 [1766] he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He went
939987 [1767] out of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps.
939987 [1768] Alyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too,
939987 [1769] that the elder was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going
939987 [1770] towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor
939987 [1771] Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.
939987 [1772] 
939987 [1773] â€œBlessed man!â€ he cried, with feeling. â€œAllow me to kiss your hand once
939987 [1774] more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think
939987 [1775] I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting
939987 [1776] like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all
939987 [1777] the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my
939987 [1778] humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one
939987 [1779] can get on with you! But now, Iâ€™ll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the
939987 [1780] time. Iâ€™ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak,
939987 [1781] Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left nowâ€”for ten
939987 [1782] minutes.â€
939987 [1783]

939987 [1786] Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith
939987 [1787] 
939987 [1788] 
939987 [1789] Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct,
939987 [1790] there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told that
939987 [1791] the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in
939987 [1792] anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come
939987 [1793] out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it
939987 [1794] set aside for women of rank.
939987 [1795] 
939987 [1796] Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and always
939987 [1797] dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. She
939987 [1798] was not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow. Her
939987 [1799] daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The poor child had
939987 [1800] not been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in a
939987 [1801] long reclining chair. She had a charming little face, rather thin from
939987 [1802] illness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark
939987 [1803] eyes with their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her
939987 [1804] abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by
939987 [1805] business connected with their estate. They had been staying a week in our
939987 [1806] town, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, but
939987 [1807] had visited Father Zossima once already, three days before. Though they
939987 [1808] knew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned up
939987 [1809] again, and urgently entreated â€œthe happiness of looking once again on the
939987 [1810] great healer.â€
939987 [1811] 
939987 [1812] The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughterâ€™s invalid
939987 [1813] carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of our
939987 [1814] monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north.
939987 [1815] He too sought the elderâ€™s blessing.
939987 [1816] 
939987 [1817] But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the
939987 [1818] peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into
939987 [1819] the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and
939987 [1820] began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led
939987 [1821] up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking
939987 [1822] and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her
939987 [1823] forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and
939987 [1824] quieted.
939987 [1825] 
939987 [1826] I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to
939987 [1827] see and hear these â€œpossessedâ€ women in the villages and monasteries. They
939987 [1828] used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that
939987 [1829] they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in
939987 [1830] and they were led up to it, at once the â€œpossessionâ€ ceased, and the sick
939987 [1831] women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed
939987 [1832] at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my
939987 [1833] town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that
939987 [1834] it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told
939987 [1835] to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical
939987 [1836] specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible
939987 [1837] illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in
939987 [1838] Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a
939987 [1839] disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard,
939987 [1840] abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery,
939987 [1841] from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like
939987 [1842] others. The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling
939987 [1843] woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been
939987 [1844] explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the â€œclericals,â€
939987 [1845] arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported
939987 [1846] her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that
939987 [1847] the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman
939987 [1848] were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, with
939987 [1849] a nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the
939987 [1850] whole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the
939987 [1851] moment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the
939987 [1852] miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and
939987 [1853] it did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same now
939987 [1854] as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.
939987 [1855] 
939987 [1856] Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the
939987 [1857] effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, others
939987 [1858] cried out in sing-song voices.
939987 [1859] 
939987 [1860] He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The â€œpossessedâ€ woman he
939987 [1861] knew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery,
939987 [1862] and had been brought to him before.
939987 [1863] 
939987 [1864] â€œBut here is one from afar.â€ He pointed to a woman by no means old but
939987 [1865] very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened
939987 [1866] by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder;
939987 [1867] there was something almost frenzied in her eyes.
939987 [1868] 
939987 [1869] â€œFrom afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here.
939987 [1870] From afar off, Father, from afar off!â€ the woman began in a sing-song
939987 [1871] voice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head from side to
939987 [1872] side with her cheek resting in her hand.
939987 [1873] 
939987 [1874] There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the
939987 [1875] peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief
939987 [1876] that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent
939987 [1877] in wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter a
939987 [1878] grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart
939987 [1879] still more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense
939987 [1880] of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to
939987 [1881] reopen the wound.
939987 [1882] 
939987 [1883] â€œYou are of the tradesman class?â€ said Father Zossima, looking curiously
939987 [1884] at her.
939987 [1885] 
939987 [1886] â€œTownfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live in
939987 [1887] the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father, we
939987 [1888] heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a
939987 [1889] pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, â€˜Go,
939987 [1890] Nastasya, go to themâ€™â€”that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at the
939987 [1891] service, and to-day I have come to you.â€
939987 [1892] 
939987 [1893] â€œWhat are you weeping for?â€
939987 [1894] 
939987 [1895] â€œItâ€™s my little son Iâ€™m grieving for, Father. He was three years oldâ€”three
939987 [1896] years all but three months. For my little boy, Father, Iâ€™m in anguish, for
939987 [1897] my little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and
939987 [1898] now weâ€™ve no children, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the first
939987 [1899] three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I canâ€™t
939987 [1900] forget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He has
939987 [1901] withered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his
939987 [1902] little boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his
939987 [1903] little things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, â€˜Let
939987 [1904] me go on a pilgrimage, master.â€™ He is a driver. Weâ€™re not poor people,
939987 [1905] Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. Itâ€™s all our own, the horse and
939987 [1906] the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun
939987 [1907] drinking while I am away. Heâ€™s sure to. It used to be so before. As soon
939987 [1908] as I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I donâ€™t think about him.
939987 [1909] Itâ€™s three months since I left home. Iâ€™ve forgotten him. Iâ€™ve forgotten
939987 [1910] everything. I donâ€™t want to remember. And what would our life be now
939987 [1911] together? Iâ€™ve done with him, Iâ€™ve done. Iâ€™ve done with them all. I donâ€™t
939987 [1912] care to look upon my house and my goods. I donâ€™t care to see anything at
939987 [1913] all!â€
939987 [1914] 
939987 [1915] â€œListen, mother,â€ said the elder. â€œOnce in olden times a holy saint saw in
939987 [1916] the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only one,
939987 [1917] whom God had taken. â€˜Knowest thou not,â€™ said the saint to her, â€˜how bold
939987 [1918] these little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there are none
939987 [1919] bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. â€œThou didst give us life, O
939987 [1920] Lord,â€ they say, â€œand scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take
939987 [1921] it back again.â€ And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them
939987 [1922] at once the rank of angels. Therefore,â€™ said the saint, â€˜thou, too, O
939987 [1923] mother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the
939987 [1924] fellowship of the angels.â€™ Thatâ€™s what the saint said to the weeping
939987 [1925] mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely.
939987 [1926] Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before the
939987 [1927] throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, and
939987 [1928] therefore weep not, but rejoice.â€
939987 [1929] 
939987 [1930] The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. She
939987 [1931] sighed deeply.
939987 [1932] 
939987 [1933] â€œMy Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. â€˜Foolish one,â€™
939987 [1934] he said, â€˜why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before
939987 [1935] God.â€™ He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he cries like
939987 [1936] me. â€˜I know, Nikita,â€™ said I. â€˜Where could he be if not with the Lord God?
939987 [1937] Only, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before.â€™ And
939987 [1938] if only I could look upon him one little time, if only I could peep at him
939987 [1939] one little time, without going up to him, without speaking, if I could be
939987 [1940] hidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him
939987 [1941] playing in the yard, calling in his little voice, â€˜Mammy, where are you?â€™
939987 [1942] If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room
939987 [1943] just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used to run
939987 [1944] to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet I should
939987 [1945] know him! But heâ€™s gone, Father, heâ€™s gone, and I shall never hear him
939987 [1946] again. Hereâ€™s his little sash, but him I shall never see or hear now.â€
939987 [1947] 
939987 [1948] She drew out of her bosom her boyâ€™s little embroidered sash, and as soon
939987 [1949] as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes with her
939987 [1950] fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.
939987 [1951] 
939987 [1952] â€œIt is Rachel of old,â€ said the elder, â€œweeping for her children, and will
939987 [1953] not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on earth for
939987 [1954] you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep and
939987 [1955] be not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep be sure to
939987 [1956] remember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looks
939987 [1957] down from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and
939987 [1958] points at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that
939987 [1959] great motherâ€™s grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your
939987 [1960] bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart
939987 [1961] and delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your childâ€™s
939987 [1962] soul. What was his name?â€
939987 [1963] 
939987 [1964] â€œAlexey, Father.â€
939987 [1965] 
939987 [1966] â€œA sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?â€
939987 [1967] 
939987 [1968] â€œYes, Father.â€
939987 [1969] 
939987 [1970] â€œWhat a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in my
939987 [1971] prayers, and I will pray for your husbandâ€™s health. It is a sin for you to
939987 [1972] leave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his
939987 [1973] father, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his happiness? He is
939987 [1974] living, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is not in the house he
939987 [1975] is near you, unseen. How can he go into the house when you say that the
939987 [1976] house is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together,
939987 [1977] his father and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But
939987 [1978] then he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this
939987 [1979] very day.â€
939987 [1980] 
939987 [1981] â€œI will go, Father, at your word. I will go. Youâ€™ve gone straight to my
939987 [1982] heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,â€ the woman began in a
939987 [1983] sing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very old
939987 [1984] woman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes
939987 [1985] showed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something.
939987 [1986] She said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close
939987 [1987] by in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had
939987 [1988] gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now a
939987 [1989] year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him, but she
939987 [1990] did not know the proper place to inquire.
939987 [1991] 
939987 [1992] â€œOnly the other day Stepanida Ilyinishnaâ€”sheâ€™s a rich merchantâ€™s wifeâ€”said
939987 [1993] to me, â€˜You go, Prohorovna, and put your sonâ€™s name down for prayer in the
939987 [1994] church, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead. His
939987 [1995] soul will be troubled,â€™ she said, â€˜and he will write you a letter.â€™ And
939987 [1996] Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many
939987 [1997] times tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or
939987 [1998] false, and would it be right?â€
939987 [1999] 
939987 [2000] â€œDonâ€™t think of it. Itâ€™s shameful to ask the question. How is it possible
939987 [2001] to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother too! Itâ€™s a
939987 [2002] great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you.
939987 [2003] Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for his
939987 [2004] good health, and that she may forgive you for your error. And another
939987 [2005] thing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you,
939987 [2006] your son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in
939987 [2007] peace. Your son is alive, I tell you.â€
939987 [2008] 
939987 [2009] â€œDear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us and
939987 [2010] for our sins!â€
939987 [2011] 
939987 [2012] But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon
939987 [2013] him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman was
939987 [2014] gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid to
939987 [2015] approach.
939987 [2016] 
939987 [2017] â€œWhat is it, my child?â€
939987 [2018] 
939987 [2019] â€œAbsolve my soul, Father,â€ she articulated softly, and slowly sank on her
939987 [2020] knees and bowed down at his feet. â€œI have sinned, Father. I am afraid of
939987 [2021] my sin.â€
939987 [2022] 
939987 [2023] The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him, still
939987 [2024] on her knees.
939987 [2025] 
939987 [2026] â€œI am a widow these three years,â€ she began in a half-whisper, with a sort
939987 [2027] of shudder. â€œI had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man. He used
939987 [2028] to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he were to
939987 [2029] get well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the thought came
939987 [2030] to meâ€”â€
939987 [2031] 
939987 [2032] â€œStay!â€ said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.
939987 [2033] 
939987 [2034] The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to
939987 [2035] catch anything. She had soon done.
939987 [2036] 
939987 [2037] â€œThree years ago?â€ asked the elder.
939987 [2038] 
939987 [2039] â€œThree years. At first I didnâ€™t think about it, but now Iâ€™ve begun to be
939987 [2040] ill, and the thought never leaves me.â€
939987 [2041] 
939987 [2042] â€œHave you come from far?â€
939987 [2043] 
939987 [2044] â€œOver three hundred miles away.â€
939987 [2045] 
939987 [2046] â€œHave you told it in confession?â€
939987 [2047] 
939987 [2048] â€œI have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.â€
939987 [2049] 
939987 [2050] â€œHave you been admitted to Communion?â€
939987 [2051] 
939987 [2052] â€œYes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.â€
939987 [2053] 
939987 [2054] â€œFear nothing and never be afraid; and donâ€™t fret. If only your penitence
939987 [2055] fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there can be no sin
939987 [2056] on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant!
939987 [2057] Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God.
939987 [2058] Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of
939987 [2059] repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe
939987 [2060] that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your
939987 [2061] sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner
939987 [2062] there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not.
939987 [2063] Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the
939987 [2064] dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in
939987 [2065] truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All
939987 [2066] things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even
939987 [2067] as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will
939987 [2068] God. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world
939987 [2069] by it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.â€
939987 [2070] 
939987 [2071] He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a little
939987 [2072] ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking.
939987 [2073] 
939987 [2074] He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny
939987 [2075] baby in her arms.
939987 [2076] 
939987 [2077] â€œFrom Vyshegorye, dear Father.â€
939987 [2078] 
939987 [2079] â€œFive miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?â€
939987 [2080] 
939987 [2081] â€œIâ€™ve come to look at you. I have been to you beforeâ€”or have you
939987 [2082] forgotten? Youâ€™ve no great memory if youâ€™ve forgotten me. They told us you
939987 [2083] were ill. Thinks I, Iâ€™ll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, and
939987 [2084] youâ€™re not ill! Youâ€™ll live another twenty years. God bless you! There are
939987 [2085] plenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?â€
939987 [2086] 
939987 [2087] â€œI thank you for all, daughter.â€
939987 [2088] 
939987 [2089] â€œBy the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty
939987 [2090] copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought as
939987 [2091] I came along, better give through him. Heâ€™ll know whom to give to.â€
939987 [2092] 
939987 [2093] â€œThanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so
939987 [2094] certainly. Is that your little girl?â€
939987 [2095] 
939987 [2096] â€œMy little girl, Father, Lizaveta.â€
939987 [2097] 
939987 [2098] â€œMay the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You have
939987 [2099] gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.â€
939987 [2100] 
939987 [2101] He blessed them all and bowed low to them.
939987 [2102] 
939987 [2103] 
939987 [2104] 
939987 [2105] Chapter IV. A Lady Of Little Faith
939987 [2106] 
939987 [2107] 
939987 [2108] A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the peasants and
939987 [2109] his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with her
939987 [2110] handkerchief. She was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good
939987 [2111] disposition in many respects. When the elder went up to her at last she
939987 [2112] met him enthusiastically.
939987 [2113] 
939987 [2114] â€œAh, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...â€ She
939987 [2115] could not go on for emotion. â€œOh, I understand the peopleâ€™s love for you.
939987 [2116] I love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could help loving
939987 [2117] them, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!â€
939987 [2118] 
939987 [2119] â€œHow is your daughterâ€™s health? You wanted to talk to me again?â€
939987 [2120] 
939987 [2121] â€œOh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it! I was
939987 [2122] ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until
939987 [2123] you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express our ardent
939987 [2124] gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely by
939987 [2125] praying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We have
939987 [2126] hastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our
939987 [2127] homage.â€
939987 [2128] 
939987 [2129] â€œWhat do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her chair.â€
939987 [2130] 
939987 [2131] â€œBut her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,â€ said the
939987 [2132] lady with nervous haste. â€œAnd thatâ€™s not all. Her legs are stronger. This
939987 [2133] morning she got up well; she had slept all night. Look at her rosy cheeks,
939987 [2134] her bright eyes! She used to be always crying, but now she laughs and is
939987 [2135] gay and happy. This morning she insisted on my letting her stand up, and
939987 [2136] she stood up for a whole minute without any support. She wagers that in a
939987 [2137] fortnight sheâ€™ll be dancing a quadrille. Iâ€™ve called in Doctor
939987 [2138] Herzenstube. He shrugged his shoulders and said, â€˜I am amazed; I can make
939987 [2139] nothing of it.â€™ And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not
939987 [2140] fly here to thank you? Lise, thank himâ€”thank him!â€
939987 [2141] 
939987 [2142] Liseâ€™s pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She rose in
939987 [2143] her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder, clasped her hands
939987 [2144] before him, but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter.
939987 [2145] 
939987 [2146] â€œItâ€™s at him,â€ she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation at
939987 [2147] herself for not being able to repress her mirth.
939987 [2148] 
939987 [2149] If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, he
939987 [2150] would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant. His
939987 [2151] eyes shone and he looked down.
939987 [2152] 
939987 [2153] â€œShe has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?â€ the mother
939987 [2154] went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.
939987 [2155] 
939987 [2156] The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha. The
939987 [2157] latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way, held
939987 [2158] out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important air.
939987 [2159] 
939987 [2160] â€œKaterina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.â€ She handed him a little
939987 [2161] note. â€œShe particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible;
939987 [2162] that you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.â€
939987 [2163] 
939987 [2164] â€œShe asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?â€ Alyosha muttered in great
939987 [2165] astonishment. His face at once looked anxious. â€œOh, itâ€™s all to do with
939987 [2166] Dmitri Fyodorovitch andâ€”what has happened lately,â€ the mother explained
939987 [2167] hurriedly. â€œKaterina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see you
939987 [2168] about it.... Why, of course, I canâ€™t say. But she wants to see you at
939987 [2169] once. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.â€
939987 [2170] 
939987 [2171] â€œI have only seen her once,â€ Alyosha protested with the same perplexity.
939987 [2172] 
939987 [2173] â€œOh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her
939987 [2174] suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring now!
939987 [2175] Think what awaits her! Itâ€™s all terrible, terrible!â€
939987 [2176] 
939987 [2177] â€œVery well, I will come,â€ Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the
939987 [2178] brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would
939987 [2179] come, without any sort of explanation.
939987 [2180] 
939987 [2181] â€œOh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!â€ cried Lise with sudden
939987 [2182] animation. â€œI told mamma youâ€™d be sure not to go. I said you were saving
939987 [2183] your soul. How splendid you are! Iâ€™ve always thought you were splendid.
939987 [2184] How glad I am to tell you so!â€
939987 [2185] 
939987 [2186] â€œLise!â€ said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had said
939987 [2187] it.
939987 [2188] 
939987 [2189] â€œYou have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ she said; â€œyou never
939987 [2190] come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except
939987 [2191] with you.â€
939987 [2192] 
939987 [2193] Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled
939987 [2194] without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He had
939987 [2195] begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his
939987 [2196] entrance by Liseâ€™s chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that is
939987 [2197] of the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in
939987 [2198] his own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from the far
939987 [2199] north, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor
939987 [2200] monastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing
939987 [2201] and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.
939987 [2202] 
939987 [2203] â€œHow can you presume to do such deeds?â€ the monk asked suddenly, pointing
939987 [2204] solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her â€œhealing.â€
939987 [2205] 
939987 [2206] â€œItâ€™s too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete cure,
939987 [2207] and may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing,
939987 [2208] it is by no power but Godâ€™s will. Itâ€™s all from God. Visit me, Father,â€ he
939987 [2209] added to the monk. â€œItâ€™s not often I can see visitors. I am ill, and I
939987 [2210] know that my days are numbered.â€
939987 [2211] 
939987 [2212] â€œOh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, long
939987 [2213] time yet,â€ cried the lady. â€œAnd in what way are you ill? You look so well,
939987 [2214] so gay and happy.â€
939987 [2215] 
939987 [2216] â€œI am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that itâ€™s only for a
939987 [2217] moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to you,
939987 [2218] you could never say anything that would please me so much. For men are
939987 [2219] made for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to say
939987 [2220] to himself, â€˜I am doing Godâ€™s will on earth.â€™ All the righteous, all the
939987 [2221] saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.â€
939987 [2222] 
939987 [2223] â€œOh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!â€ cried the lady. â€œYou seem
939987 [2224] to pierce with your words. And yetâ€”happiness, happinessâ€”where is it? Who
939987 [2225] can say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you have been so good as to
939987 [2226] let us see you once more to-day, let me tell you what I could not utter
939987 [2227] last time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and have been for so
939987 [2228] long! I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering!â€
939987 [2229] 
939987 [2230] And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.
939987 [2231] 
939987 [2232] â€œFrom what specially?â€
939987 [2233] 
939987 [2234] â€œI suffer ... from lack of faith.â€
939987 [2235] 
939987 [2236] â€œLack of faith in God?â€
939987 [2237] 
939987 [2238] â€œOh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future lifeâ€”it is such
939987 [2239] an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You are a healer, you
939987 [2240] are deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare not expect you
939987 [2241] to believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of honor that I am not
939987 [2242] speaking lightly now. The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts
939987 [2243] me to anguish, to terror. And I donâ€™t know to whom to appeal, and have not
939987 [2244] dared to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God! What
939987 [2245] will you think of me now?â€
939987 [2246] 
939987 [2247] She clasped her hands.
939987 [2248] 
939987 [2249] â€œDonâ€™t distress yourself about my opinion of you,â€ said the elder. â€œI
939987 [2250] quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.â€
939987 [2251] 
939987 [2252] â€œOh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself if
939987 [2253] every one has faith, where did it come from? And then they do say that it
939987 [2254] all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and that none
939987 [2255] of itâ€™s real. And I say to myself, â€˜What if Iâ€™ve been believing all my
939987 [2256] life, and when I come to die thereâ€™s nothing but the burdocks growing on
939987 [2257] my grave?â€™ as I read in some author. Itâ€™s awful! Howâ€”how can I get back my
939987 [2258] faith? But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically,
939987 [2259] without thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come now
939987 [2260] to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this chance
939987 [2261] slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can I
939987 [2262] convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me and see
939987 [2263] that scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his head about it, and
939987 [2264] Iâ€™m the only one who canâ€™t stand it. Itâ€™s deadlyâ€”deadly!â€
939987 [2265] 
939987 [2266] â€œNo doubt. But thereâ€™s no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.â€
939987 [2267] 
939987 [2268] â€œHow?â€
939987 [2269] 
939987 [2270] â€œBy the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor actively
939987 [2271] and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of
939987 [2272] the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to
939987 [2273] perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will
939987 [2274] believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has
939987 [2275] been tried. This is certain.â€
939987 [2276] 
939987 [2277] â€œIn active love? Thereâ€™s another questionâ€”and such a question! You see, I
939987 [2278] so love humanity thatâ€”would you believe it?â€”I often dream of forsaking all
939987 [2279] that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy. I close my eyes
939987 [2280] and think and dream, and at that moment I feel full of strength to
939987 [2281] overcome all obstacles. No wounds, no festering sores could at that moment
939987 [2282] frighten me. I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would
939987 [2283] nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.â€
939987 [2284] 
939987 [2285] â€œIt is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not
939987 [2286] others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.â€
939987 [2287] 
939987 [2288] â€œYes. But could I endure such a life for long?â€ the lady went on
939987 [2289] fervently, almost frantically. â€œThatâ€™s the chief questionâ€”thatâ€™s my most
939987 [2290] agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, â€˜Would you persevere
939987 [2291] long on that path? And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not
939987 [2292] meet you with gratitude, but worried you with his whims, without valuing
939987 [2293] or remarking your charitable services, began abusing you and rudely
939987 [2294] commanding you, and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which
939987 [2295] often happens when people are in great suffering)â€”what then? Would you
939987 [2296] persevere in your love, or not?â€™ And do you know, I came with horror to
939987 [2297] the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity, it
939987 [2298] would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant, I expect my payment
939987 [2299] at onceâ€”that is, praise, and the repayment of love with love. Otherwise I
939987 [2300] am incapable of loving any one.â€
939987 [2301] 
939987 [2302] She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding, she
939987 [2303] looked with defiant resolution at the elder.
939987 [2304] 
939987 [2305] â€œItâ€™s just the same story as a doctor once told me,â€ observed the elder.
939987 [2306] â€œHe was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as
939987 [2307] frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. â€˜I love humanity,â€™ he
939987 [2308] said, â€˜but I wonder at myself. The more I love humanity in general, the
939987 [2309] less I love man in particular. In my dreams,â€™ he said, â€˜I have often come
939987 [2310] to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I
939987 [2311] might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary;
939987 [2312] and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two
939987 [2313] days together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me, his
939987 [2314] personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. In
939987 [2315] twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because heâ€™s too
939987 [2316] long over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing
939987 [2317] his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But
939987 [2318] it has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more
939987 [2319] ardent becomes my love for humanity.â€™ â€
939987 [2320] 
939987 [2321] â€œBut whatâ€™s to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one despair?â€
939987 [2322] 
939987 [2323] â€œNo. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and it
939987 [2324] will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you since you can so
939987 [2325] deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have been talking to me so
939987 [2326] sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did from
939987 [2327] me just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in the
939987 [2328] achievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and your
939987 [2329] whole life will slip away like a phantom. In that case you will naturally
939987 [2330] cease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer
939987 [2331] after a fashion in the end.â€
939987 [2332] 
939987 [2333] â€œYou have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that I was
939987 [2334] really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you I
939987 [2335] could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to myself. You have
939987 [2336] seen through me and explained me to myself!â€
939987 [2337] 
939987 [2338] â€œAre you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I believe
939987 [2339] that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not attain happiness,
939987 [2340] always remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it.
939987 [2341] Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness
939987 [2342] to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every
939987 [2343] hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself.
939987 [2344] What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of
939987 [2345] your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the
939987 [2346] consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own
939987 [2347] faint-heartedness in attaining love. Donâ€™t be frightened overmuch even at
939987 [2348] your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for
939987 [2349] love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.
939987 [2350] Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in
939987 [2351] the sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does
939987 [2352] not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as
939987 [2353] though on the stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some
939987 [2354] people too, perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you
939987 [2355] see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther
939987 [2356] from your goal instead of nearer to itâ€”at that very moment I predict that
939987 [2357] you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who
939987 [2358] has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you. Forgive me for
939987 [2359] not being able to stay longer with you. They are waiting for me. Good-by.â€
939987 [2360] 
939987 [2361] The lady was weeping.
939987 [2362] 
939987 [2363] â€œLise, Lise! Bless herâ€”bless her!â€ she cried, starting up suddenly.
939987 [2364] 
939987 [2365] â€œShe does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness all along,â€
939987 [2366] the elder said jestingly. â€œWhy have you been laughing at Alexey?â€
939987 [2367] 
939987 [2368] Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time. She had
939987 [2369] noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her, and she
939987 [2370] found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to catch his eye.
939987 [2371] Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was irresistibly and
939987 [2372] suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she smiled triumphantly in
939987 [2373] his face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed. At last he turned
939987 [2374] away from her altogether and hid behind the elderâ€™s back. After a few
939987 [2375] minutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he turned again to see
939987 [2376] whether he was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out
939987 [2377] of her chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look.
939987 [2378] Catching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying,
939987 [2379] â€œWhy do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?â€
939987 [2380] 
939987 [2381] Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed and her
939987 [2382] face became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and nervously in a
939987 [2383] warm and resentful voice:
939987 [2384] 
939987 [2385] â€œWhy has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me about when I
939987 [2386] was little. We used to play together. He used to come to teach me to read,
939987 [2387] do you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he would never
939987 [2388] forget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now heâ€™s
939987 [2389] afraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesnâ€™t he want to
939987 [2390] come near me? Why doesnâ€™t he talk? Why wonâ€™t he come and see us? Itâ€™s not
939987 [2391] that you wonâ€™t let him. We know that he goes everywhere. Itâ€™s not good
939987 [2392] manners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought of it first, if he
939987 [2393] hasnâ€™t forgotten me. No, now heâ€™s saving his soul! Why have you put that
939987 [2394] long gown on him? If he runs heâ€™ll fall.â€
939987 [2395] 
939987 [2396] And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible,
939987 [2397] prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a
939987 [2398] smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly
939987 [2399] pressed it to her eyes and began crying.
939987 [2400] 
939987 [2401] â€œDonâ€™t be angry with me. Iâ€™m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps
939987 [2402] Alyoshaâ€™s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a
939987 [2403] ridiculous girl.â€
939987 [2404] 
939987 [2405] â€œI will certainly send him,â€ said the elder.
939987 [2406] 
939987 [2407] 
939987 [2408] 
939987 [2409] Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It!
939987 [2410] 
939987 [2411] 
939987 [2412] The elderâ€™s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five
939987 [2413] minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account
939987 [2414] they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be
939987 [2415] forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests
939987 [2416] engaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks took the leading
939987 [2417] share in it. MiÃ¼sov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently very
939987 [2418] eagerly, in the conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was
939987 [2419] evidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with neglect,
939987 [2420] which increased his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
939987 [2421] Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showed
939987 [2422] him.
939987 [2423] 
939987 [2424] â€œHitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is
939987 [2425] progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,â€
939987 [2426] he thought.
939987 [2427] 
939987 [2428] Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be quiet, had
939987 [2429] actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his neighbor MiÃ¼sov with
939987 [2430] an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his discomfiture. He had been
939987 [2431] waiting for some time to pay off old scores, and now he could not let the
939987 [2432] opportunity slip. Bending over his shoulder he began teasing him again in
939987 [2433] a whisper.
939987 [2434] 
939987 [2435] â€œWhy didnâ€™t you go away just now, after the â€˜courteously kissingâ€™? Why did
939987 [2436] you consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you felt
939987 [2437] insulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by showing
939987 [2438] off your intelligence. Now you wonâ€™t go till youâ€™ve displayed your
939987 [2439] intellect to them.â€
939987 [2440] 
939987 [2441] â€œYou again?... On the contrary, Iâ€™m just going.â€
939987 [2442] 
939987 [2443] â€œYouâ€™ll be the last, the last of all to go!â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
939987 [2444] him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossimaâ€™s return.
939987 [2445] 
939987 [2446] The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself in
939987 [2447] his former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting them to
939987 [2448] go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his face, saw that he was
939987 [2449] fearfully exhausted and making a great effort. Of late he had been liable
939987 [2450] to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face had the pallor that was common
939987 [2451] before such attacks, and his lips were white. But he evidently did not
939987 [2452] want to break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of his
939987 [2453] own in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
939987 [2454] 
939987 [2455] â€œWe are discussing this gentlemanâ€™s most interesting article,â€ said Father
939987 [2456] Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. â€œHe
939987 [2457] brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways.
939987 [2458] It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical
939987 [2459] authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of
939987 [2460] its jurisdiction.â€
939987 [2461] 
939987 [2462] â€œIâ€™m sorry I have not read your article, but Iâ€™ve heard of it,â€ said the
939987 [2463] elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
939987 [2464] 
939987 [2465] â€œHe takes up a most interesting position,â€ continued the Father Librarian.
939987 [2466] â€œAs far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed
939987 [2467] to the separation of Church from State.â€
939987 [2468] 
939987 [2469] â€œThatâ€™s interesting. But in what sense?â€ Father Zossima asked Ivan.
939987 [2470] 
939987 [2471] The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had
939987 [2472] feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently
939987 [2473] without the slightest _arriÃ¨re-pensÃ©e_.
939987 [2474] 
939987 [2475] â€œI start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of
939987 [2476] the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for
939987 [2477] ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and
939987 [2478] that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even
939987 [2479] normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it.
939987 [2480] Compromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for
939987 [2481] instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.
939987 [2482] My clerical opponent maintains that the Church holds a precise and defined
939987 [2483] position in the State. I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church ought
939987 [2484] to include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and,
939987 [2485] if this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in
939987 [2486] reality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the future
939987 [2487] development of Christian society!â€
939987 [2488] 
939987 [2489] â€œPerfectly true,â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy, the silent and learned monk, assented
939987 [2490] with fervor and decision.
939987 [2491] 
939987 [2492] â€œThe purest Ultramontanism!â€ cried MiÃ¼sov impatiently, crossing and
939987 [2493] recrossing his legs.
939987 [2494] 
939987 [2495] â€œOh, well, we have no mountains,â€ cried Father Iosif, and turning to the
939987 [2496] elder he continued: â€œObserve the answer he makes to the following
939987 [2497] â€˜fundamental and essentialâ€™ propositions of his opponent, who is, you must
939987 [2498] note, an ecclesiastic. First, that â€˜no social organization can or ought to
939987 [2499] arrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights of
939987 [2500] its members.â€™ Secondly, that â€˜criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to
939987 [2501] belong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as a
939987 [2502] divine institution and as an organization of men for religious objects,â€™
939987 [2503] and, finally, in the third place, â€˜the Church is a kingdom not of this
939987 [2504] world.â€™ â€
939987 [2505] 
939987 [2506] â€œA most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy could
939987 [2507] not refrain from breaking in again. â€œI have read the book which you have
939987 [2508] answered,â€ he added, addressing Ivan, â€œand was astounded at the words â€˜the
939987 [2509] Church is a kingdom not of this world.â€™ If it is not of this world, then
939987 [2510] it cannot exist on earth at all. In the Gospel, the words â€˜not of this
939987 [2511] worldâ€™ are not used in that sense. To play with such words is
939987 [2512] indefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth.
939987 [2513] The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but
939987 [2514] it is only entered through the Church which has been founded and
939987 [2515] established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a
939987 [2516] connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, a
939987 [2517] kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the
939987 [2518] kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine promise.â€
939987 [2519] 
939987 [2520] He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After listening
939987 [2521] attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder with
939987 [2522] perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:
939987 [2523] 
939987 [2524] â€œThe whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first
939987 [2525] three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and was
939987 [2526] nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to become
939987 [2527] Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it included
939987 [2528] the Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments. In
939987 [2529] reality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of
939987 [2530] the pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects
939987 [2531] and fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering
939987 [2532] into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental
939987 [2533] principlesâ€”the rock on which it standsâ€”and could pursue no other aims than
939987 [2534] those which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them
939987 [2535] that of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State
939987 [2536] itself, into the Church. In that way (that is, with a view to the future)
939987 [2537] it is not the Church that should seek a definite position in the State,
939987 [2538] like â€˜every social organization,â€™ or as â€˜an organization of men for
939987 [2539] religious purposesâ€™ (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the
939987 [2540] contrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completely
939987 [2541] transformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a Church,
939987 [2542] rejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this
939987 [2543] will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great
939987 [2544] State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false,
939987 [2545] still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone
939987 [2546] leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the book _On the
939987 [2547] Foundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged correctly if, in
939987 [2548] seeking and laying down those foundations, he had looked upon them as a
939987 [2549] temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days. But as
939987 [2550] soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he
939987 [2551] predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the
939987 [2552] permanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he is going directly
939987 [2553] against the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist
939987 [2554] of my article.â€
939987 [2555] 
939987 [2556] â€œThat is, in brief,â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy began again, laying stress on each
939987 [2557] word, â€œaccording to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the
939987 [2558] nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, as
939987 [2559] though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as to
939987 [2560] disappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, and
939987 [2561] civilization. And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will
939987 [2562] be set apart for her in the State, and even that under controlâ€”and this
939987 [2563] will be so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopes
939987 [2564] and conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower
939987 [2565] into a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State
939987 [2566] should end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else. So
939987 [2567] be it! So be it!â€
939987 [2568] 
939987 [2569] â€œWell, I confess youâ€™ve reassured me somewhat,â€ MiÃ¼sov said smiling, again
939987 [2570] crossing his legs. â€œSo far as I understand, then, the realization of such
939987 [2571] an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ. Thatâ€™s as
939987 [2572] you please. Itâ€™s a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war,
939987 [2573] diplomacy, banks, and so onâ€”something after the fashion of socialism,
939987 [2574] indeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that the
939987 [2575] Church might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence them to
939987 [2576] beating, prison, and even death.â€
939987 [2577] 
939987 [2578] â€œBut if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would not
939987 [2579] even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the way of
939987 [2580] regarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, but
939987 [2581] fairly soon,â€ Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.
939987 [2582] 
939987 [2583] â€œAre you serious?â€ MiÃ¼sov glanced keenly at him.
939987 [2584] 
939987 [2585] â€œIf everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the
939987 [2586] criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,â€ Ivan went
939987 [2587] on. â€œI ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut off
939987 [2588] then not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he would
939987 [2589] have transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ.
939987 [2590] This is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly
939987 [2591] enunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to-day compromises with
939987 [2592] his conscience: â€˜I steal,â€™ he says, â€˜but I donâ€™t go against the Church.
939987 [2593] Iâ€™m not an enemy of Christ.â€™ Thatâ€™s what the criminal of to-day is
939987 [2594] continually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the
939987 [2595] State it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over
939987 [2596] the world, to say: â€˜All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are
939987 [2597] the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian
939987 [2598] Church.â€™ It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires a
939987 [2599] rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, take
939987 [2600] the Churchâ€™s own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present
939987 [2601] almost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its
939987 [2602] tainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, into
939987 [2603] completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man,
939987 [2604] of his reformation and salvation?â€
939987 [2605] 
939987 [2606] â€œWhat do you mean? I fail to understand again,â€ MiÃ¼sov interrupted. â€œSome
939987 [2607] sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible. What
939987 [2608] is excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I suspect you are simply
939987 [2609] amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [2610] 
939987 [2611] â€œYes, but you know, in reality it is so now,â€ said the elder suddenly, and
939987 [2612] all turned to him at once. â€œIf it were not for the Church of Christ there
939987 [2613] would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no real
939987 [2614] chastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical
939987 [2615] punishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only
939987 [2616] embitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one,
939987 [2617] the only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin
939987 [2618] by conscience.â€
939987 [2619] 
939987 [2620] â€œHow is that, may one inquire?â€ asked MiÃ¼sov, with lively curiosity.
939987 [2621] 
939987 [2622] â€œWhy,â€ began the elder, â€œall these sentences to exile with hard labor, and
939987 [2623] formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and whatâ€™s more, deter hardly
939987 [2624] a single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish but is
939987 [2625] continually on the increase. You must admit that. Consequently the
939987 [2626] security of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious member
939987 [2627] is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another criminal
939987 [2628] always comes to take his place at once, and often two of them. If anything
939987 [2629] does preserve society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform
939987 [2630] the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience. It
939987 [2631] is only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian
939987 [2632] societyâ€”that is, of the Churchâ€”that he recognizes his sin against
939987 [2633] societyâ€”that is, against the Church. So that it is only against the
939987 [2634] Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day can
939987 [2635] recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,
939987 [2636] then it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to
939987 [2637] itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the power of
939987 [2638] moral condemnation, withdraws of her own accord from punishing the
939987 [2639] criminal actively. She does not excommunicate him but simply persists in
939987 [2640] motherly exhortation of him. What is more, the Church even tries to
939987 [2641] preserve all Christian communion with the criminal. She admits him to
939987 [2642] church services, to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him
939987 [2643] more as a captive than as a convict. And what would become of the
939987 [2644] criminal, O Lord, if even the Christian societyâ€”that is, the Churchâ€”were
939987 [2645] to reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off? What
939987 [2646] would become of him if the Church punished him with her excommunication as
939987 [2647] the direct consequence of the secular law? There could be no more terrible
939987 [2648] despair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still have
939987 [2649] faith. Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen,
939987 [2650] perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then
939987 [2651] what would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother,
939987 [2652] holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely
939987 [2653] punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one to
939987 [2654] have pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgment
939987 [2655] is the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practically
939987 [2656] and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary
939987 [2657] compromise. She can enter into no compact about that. The foreign
939987 [2658] criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to-day
939987 [2659] confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction
939987 [2660] against an unjustly oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a
939987 [2661] force that triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of
939987 [2662] themselves in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred,
939987 [2663] forgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate
939987 [2664] of the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the
939987 [2665] compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are no
939987 [2666] churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid church
939987 [2667] buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass
939987 [2668] from Church into State and to disappear in it completely. So it seems at
939987 [2669] least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was proclaimed a State
939987 [2670] instead of a Church a thousand years ago. And so the criminal is no longer
939987 [2671] conscious of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If he
939987 [2672] returns to society, often it is with such hatred that society itself
939987 [2673] instinctively cuts him off. You can judge for yourself how it must end. In
939987 [2674] many cases it would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is
939987 [2675] that besides the established law courts we have the Church too, which
939987 [2676] always keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious
939987 [2677] son. And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought,
939987 [2678] the judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice is
939987 [2679] still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively
939987 [2680] recognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said here just now is
939987 [2681] true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introduced
939987 [2682] in practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the society were
939987 [2683] changed into the Church, not only the judgment of the Church would have
939987 [2684] influence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, but
939987 [2685] possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished. And
939987 [2686] there can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the
939987 [2687] crime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in
939987 [2688] restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in
939987 [2689] regenerating the fallen. It is true,â€ said Father Zossima, with a smile,
939987 [2690] â€œthe Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven
939987 [2691] righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will continue still
939987 [2692] unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society
939987 [2693] almost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful
939987 [2694] Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for it is
939987 [2695] ordained to come to pass! And there is no need to be troubled about times
939987 [2696] and seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of
939987 [2697] God, in His foresight, and His love. And what in human reckoning seems
939987 [2698] still afar off, may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve
939987 [2699] of its appearance. And so be it, so be it!â€
939987 [2700] 
939987 [2701] â€œSo be it, so be it!â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy repeated austerely and reverently.
939987 [2702] 
939987 [2703] â€œStrange, extremely strange!â€ MiÃ¼sov pronounced, not so much with heat as
939987 [2704] with latent indignation.
939987 [2705] 
939987 [2706] â€œWhat strikes you as so strange?â€ Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
939987 [2707] 
939987 [2708] â€œWhy, itâ€™s beyond anything!â€ cried MiÃ¼sov, suddenly breaking out; â€œthe
939987 [2709] State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the State.
939987 [2710] Itâ€™s not simply Ultramontanism, itâ€™s arch-Ultramontanism! Itâ€™s beyond the
939987 [2711] dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!â€
939987 [2712] 
939987 [2713] â€œYou are completely misunderstanding it,â€ said Father PaÃ¯ssy sternly.
939987 [2714] â€œUnderstand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State. That is
939987 [2715] Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. On the
939987 [2716] contrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and become
939987 [2717] a Church over the whole worldâ€”which is the complete opposite of
939987 [2718] Ultramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the glorious
939987 [2719] destiny ordained for the Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the
939987 [2720] east!â€
939987 [2721] 
939987 [2722] MiÃ¼sov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary
939987 [2723] personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile played on his
939987 [2724] lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart. The whole
939987 [2725] conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced casually at Rakitin, who
939987 [2726] was standing immovable in his place by the door listening and watching
939987 [2727] intently though with downcast eyes. But from the color in his cheeks
939987 [2728] Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he knew
939987 [2729] what caused his excitement.
939987 [2730] 
939987 [2731] â€œAllow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,â€ MiÃ¼sov said
939987 [2732] impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. â€œSome years ago, soon after
939987 [2733] the _coup dâ€™Ã©tat_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an
939987 [2734] extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very
939987 [2735] interesting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a
939987 [2736] detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of
939987 [2737] political detectivesâ€”a rather powerful position in its own way. I was
939987 [2738] prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him.
939987 [2739] And as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing
939987 [2740] a special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, he
939987 [2741] deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course.
939987 [2742] He was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,
939987 [2743] especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The subject
939987 [2744] was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I will
939987 [2745] quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. â€˜We are not
939987 [2746] particularly afraid,â€™ said he, â€˜of all these socialists, anarchists,
939987 [2747] infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all their
939987 [2748] goings on. But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God
939987 [2749] and are Christians, but at the same time are socialists. These are the
939987 [2750] people we are most afraid of. They are dreadful people! The socialist who
939987 [2751] is a Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.â€™
939987 [2752] The words struck me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to
939987 [2753] me here, gentlemen.â€
939987 [2754] 
939987 [2755] â€œYou apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy
939987 [2756] asked directly, without beating about the bush.
939987 [2757] 
939987 [2758] But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the door
939987 [2759] opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in. They
939987 [2760] had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden appearance caused
939987 [2761] some surprise for a moment.
939987 [2762] 
939987 [2763] 
939987 [2764] 
939987 [2765] Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?
939987 [2766] 
939987 [2767] 
939987 [2768] Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height and
939987 [2769] agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was muscular, and
939987 [2770] showed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was something
939987 [2771] not healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and
939987 [2772] there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His rather large,
939987 [2773] prominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet
939987 [2774] there was a vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking
939987 [2775] irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed
939987 [2776] something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. â€œItâ€™s
939987 [2777] hard to tell what heâ€™s thinking,â€ those who talked to him sometimes
939987 [2778] declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes were
939987 [2779] startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful and
939987 [2780] light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so gloomy. A
939987 [2781] certain strained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment.
939987 [2782] Every one knew, or had heard of, the extremely restless and dissipated
939987 [2783] life which he had been leading of late, as well as of the violent anger to
939987 [2784] which he had been roused in his quarrels with his father. There were
939987 [2785] several stories current in the town about it. It is true that he was
939987 [2786] irascible by nature, â€œof an unstable and unbalanced mind,â€ as our justice
939987 [2787] of the peace, Katchalnikov, happily described him.
939987 [2788] 
939987 [2789] He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned
939987 [2790] frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat. Having only lately
939987 [2791] left the army, he still had mustaches and no beard. His dark brown hair
939987 [2792] was cropped short, and combed forward on his temples. He had the long,
939987 [2793] determined stride of a military man. He stood still for a moment on the
939987 [2794] threshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder,
939987 [2795] guessing him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his
939987 [2796] blessing. Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed
939987 [2797] his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:
939987 [2798] 
939987 [2799] â€œBe so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long, but
939987 [2800] Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my inquiries, told
939987 [2801] me twice over that the appointment was for one. Now I suddenly learnâ€”â€
939987 [2802] 
939987 [2803] â€œDonâ€™t disturb yourself,â€ interposed the elder. â€œNo matter. You are a
939987 [2804] little late. Itâ€™s of no consequence....â€
939987 [2805] 
939987 [2806] â€œIâ€™m extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your goodness.â€
939987 [2807] 
939987 [2808] Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards his
939987 [2809] father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful bow. He had
939987 [2810] evidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all seriousness,
939987 [2811] thinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions.
939987 [2812] 
939987 [2813] Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to the
939987 [2814] occasion. In response to Dmitriâ€™s bow he jumped up from his chair and made
939987 [2815] his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly solemn and
939987 [2816] impressive, which gave him a positively malignant look. Dmitri bowed
939987 [2817] generally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with his
939987 [2818] long, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near Father
939987 [2819] PaÃ¯ssy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he
939987 [2820] had interrupted.
939987 [2821] 
939987 [2822] Dmitriâ€™s entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the conversation
939987 [2823] was resumed. But this time MiÃ¼sov thought it unnecessary to reply to
939987 [2824] Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s persistent and almost irritable question.
939987 [2825] 
939987 [2826] â€œAllow me to withdraw from this discussion,â€ he observed with a certain
939987 [2827] well-bred nonchalance. â€œItâ€™s a subtle question, too. Here Ivan
939987 [2828] Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting to say
939987 [2829] about that also. Ask him.â€
939987 [2830] 
939987 [2831] â€œNothing special, except one little remark,â€ Ivan replied at once.
939987 [2832] â€œEuropean Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often mix
939987 [2833] up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity. This wild
939987 [2834] notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But itâ€™s not only Liberals
939987 [2835] and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases,
939987 [2836] it appears, the policeâ€”the foreign police, of courseâ€”do the same. Your
939987 [2837] Paris anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.â€
939987 [2838] 
939987 [2839] â€œI ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,â€ MiÃ¼sov repeated.
939987 [2840] â€œI will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and rather
939987 [2841] characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself. Only five days ago,
939987 [2842] in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he solemnly declared in
939987 [2843] argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their
939987 [2844] neighbors. That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind,
939987 [2845] and that, if there had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing
939987 [2846] to a natural law, but simply because men have believed in immortality.
939987 [2847] Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in
939987 [2848] that faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in
939987 [2849] immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of
939987 [2850] the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then would be
939987 [2851] immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism. Thatâ€™s not all. He
939987 [2852] ended by asserting that for every individual, like ourselves, who does not
939987 [2853] believe in God or immortality, the moral law of nature must immediately be
939987 [2854] changed into the exact contrary of the former religious law, and that
939987 [2855] egoism, even to crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized as
939987 [2856] the inevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position.
939987 [2857] From this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric
939987 [2858] and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitchâ€™s theories.â€
939987 [2859] 
939987 [2860] â€œExcuse me,â€ Dmitri cried suddenly; â€œif Iâ€™ve heard aright, crime must not
939987 [2861] only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the most
939987 [2862] rational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is that so or not?â€
939987 [2863] 
939987 [2864] â€œQuite so,â€ said Father PaÃ¯ssy.
939987 [2865] 
939987 [2866] â€œIâ€™ll remember it.â€
939987 [2867] 
939987 [2868] Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he had
939987 [2869] begun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.
939987 [2870] 
939987 [2871] â€œIs that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
939987 [2872] disappearance of the faith in immortality?â€ the elder asked Ivan suddenly.
939987 [2873] 
939987 [2874] â€œYes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no
939987 [2875] immortality.â€
939987 [2876] 
939987 [2877] â€œYou are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.â€
939987 [2878] 
939987 [2879] â€œWhy unhappy?â€ Ivan asked smiling.
939987 [2880] 
939987 [2881] â€œBecause, in all probability you donâ€™t believe yourself in the immortality
939987 [2882] of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your article on
939987 [2883] Church jurisdiction.â€
939987 [2884] 
939987 [2885] â€œPerhaps you are right! ... But I wasnâ€™t altogether joking,â€ Ivan suddenly
939987 [2886] and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.
939987 [2887] 
939987 [2888] â€œYou were not altogether joking. Thatâ€™s true. The question is still
939987 [2889] fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes sometimes to
939987 [2890] divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair
939987 [2891] itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself with
939987 [2892] magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you donâ€™t believe
939987 [2893] your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....
939987 [2894] That question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it
939987 [2895] clamors for an answer.â€
939987 [2896] 
939987 [2897] â€œBut can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?â€ Ivan went on
939987 [2898] asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable
939987 [2899] smile.
939987 [2900] 
939987 [2901] â€œIf it canâ€™t be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided in
939987 [2902] the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and all
939987 [2903] its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who has given you a
939987 [2904] lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higher
939987 [2905] things, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God grant that your heart will
939987 [2906] attain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path.â€
939987 [2907] 
939987 [2908] The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross over
939987 [2909] Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his seat, went up to
939987 [2910] him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand went back to his place in
939987 [2911] silence. His face looked firm and earnest. This action and all the
939987 [2912] preceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan, impressed every
939987 [2913] one by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that all were silent
939987 [2914] for a moment, and there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [2915] face. But MiÃ¼sov suddenly shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment
939987 [2916] Fyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.
939987 [2917] 
939987 [2918] â€œMost pious and holy elder,â€ he cried, pointing to Ivan, â€œthat is my son,
939987 [2919] flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most dutiful Karl
939987 [2920] Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri, against
939987 [2921] whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz Moorâ€”they are
939987 [2922] both out of Schillerâ€™s _Robbers_, and so I am the reigning Count von Moor!
939987 [2923] Judge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!â€
939987 [2924] 
939987 [2925] â€œSpeak without buffoonery, and donâ€™t begin by insulting the members of
939987 [2926] your family,â€ answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He was
939987 [2927] obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing.
939987 [2928] 
939987 [2929] â€œAn unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!â€ cried Dmitri
939987 [2930] indignantly. He too leapt up. â€œForgive it, reverend Father,â€ he added,
939987 [2931] addressing the elder. â€œI am not a cultivated man, and I donâ€™t even know
939987 [2932] how to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have been
939987 [2933] too good-natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is a
939987 [2934] scandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive. But
939987 [2935] I believe I know whyâ€”â€
939987 [2936] 
939987 [2937] â€œThey all blame me, all of them!â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn.
939987 [2938] â€œPyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, Pyotr
939987 [2939] Alexandrovitch, you have!â€ he turned suddenly to MiÃ¼sov, although the
939987 [2940] latter was not dreaming of interrupting him. â€œThey all accuse me of having
939987 [2941] hidden the childrenâ€™s money in my boots, and cheated them, but isnâ€™t there
939987 [2942] a court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
939987 [2943] from your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money you
939987 [2944] had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left. Why does Pyotr
939987 [2945] Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him.
939987 [2946] Because they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to
939987 [2947] me, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentary
939987 [2948] proof. The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was
939987 [2949] stationed before, he several times spent a thousand or two for the
939987 [2950] seduction of some respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri
939987 [2951] Fyodorovitch, in its most secret details. Iâ€™ll prove it.... Would you
939987 [2952] believe it, holy Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable
939987 [2953] of young ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,
939987 [2954] formerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and had the
939987 [2955] Anna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by his promise of
939987 [2956] marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed to him, yet
939987 [2957] before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress.
939987 [2958] And although this enchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriage
939987 [2959] with a respectable man, yet she is of an independent character, an
939987 [2960] unapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wifeâ€”for she is
939987 [2961] virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to
939987 [2962] open this fortress with a golden key, and thatâ€™s why he is insolent to me
939987 [2963] now, trying to get money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this
939987 [2964] enchantress already. Heâ€™s continually borrowing money for the purpose.
939987 [2965] From whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?â€
939987 [2966] 
939987 [2967] â€œBe silent!â€ cried Dmitri, â€œwait till Iâ€™m gone. Donâ€™t dare in my presence
939987 [2968] to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you should utter a
939987 [2969] word about her is an outrage, and I wonâ€™t permit it!â€
939987 [2970] 
939987 [2971] He was breathless.
939987 [2972] 
939987 [2973] â€œMitya! Mitya!â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a
939987 [2974] tear. â€œAnd is your fatherâ€™s blessing nothing to you? If I curse you, what
939987 [2975] then?â€
939987 [2976] 
939987 [2977] â€œShameless hypocrite!â€ exclaimed Dmitri furiously.
939987 [2978] 
939987 [2979] â€œHe says that to his father! his father! What would he be with others?
939987 [2980] Gentlemen, only fancy; thereâ€™s a poor but honorable man living here,
939987 [2981] burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and was
939987 [2982] discharged from the army, but not publicly, not by court-martial, with no
939987 [2983] slur on his honor. And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in
939987 [2984] a tavern, dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly, and all
939987 [2985] because he is an agent in a little business of mine.â€
939987 [2986] 
939987 [2987] â€œItâ€™s all a lie! Outwardly itâ€™s the truth, but inwardly a lie!â€ Dmitri was
939987 [2988] trembling with rage. â€œFather, I donâ€™t justify my action. Yes, I confess it
939987 [2989] publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I regret it now, and
939987 [2990] Iâ€™m disgusted with myself for my brutal rage. But this captain, this agent
939987 [2991] of yours, went to that lady whom you call an enchantress, and suggested to
939987 [2992] her from you, that she should take I.O.U.â€™s of mine which were in your
939987 [2993] possession, and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by
939987 [2994] means of them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my
939987 [2995] property. Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you
939987 [2996] yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face.... She
939987 [2997] told me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to put me in prison
939987 [2998] because you are jealous of me with her, because youâ€™d begun to force your
939987 [2999] attentions upon her; and I know all about that, too; she laughed at you
939987 [3000] for that as wellâ€”you hearâ€”she laughed at you as she described it. So here
939987 [3001] you have this man, this father who reproaches his profligate son!
939987 [3002] Gentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would
939987 [3003] only bring you together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if
939987 [3004] he held out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has
939987 [3005] just this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady, for
939987 [3006] whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in vain, I have
939987 [3007] made up my mind to show up his game, though he is my father....â€
939987 [3008] 
939987 [3009] He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed with
939987 [3010] difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except Father
939987 [3011] Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere but
939987 [3012] waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale, not from
939987 [3013] excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring smile lighted up
939987 [3014] his face; from time to time he raised his hand, as though to check the
939987 [3015] storm, and, of course, a gesture from him would have been enough to end
939987 [3016] the scene; but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched them
939987 [3017] intently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectly
939987 [3018] clear to him. At last MiÃ¼sov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
939987 [3019] 
939987 [3020] â€œWe are all to blame for this scandalous scene,â€ he said hotly. â€œBut I did
939987 [3021] not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal. This
939987 [3022] must be stopped at once! Believe me, your reverence, I had no precise
939987 [3023] knowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was unwilling to
939987 [3024] believe them, and I learn for the first time.... A father is jealous of
939987 [3025] his sonâ€™s relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the
939987 [3026] creature to get his son into prison! This is the company in which I have
939987 [3027] been forced to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was
939987 [3028] as much deceived as any one.â€
939987 [3029] 
939987 [3030] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an unnatural
939987 [3031] voice, â€œif you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a
939987 [3032] duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a handkerchief,â€ he
939987 [3033] ended, stamping with both feet.
939987 [3034] 
939987 [3035] With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when
939987 [3036] they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears
939987 [3037] of emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later,
939987 [3038] they are able to whisper to themselves, â€œYou know you are lying, you
939987 [3039] shameless old sinner! Youâ€™re acting now, in spite of your â€˜holyâ€™ wrath.â€
939987 [3040] 
939987 [3041] Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at his
939987 [3042] father.
939987 [3043] 
939987 [3044] â€œI thought ... I thought,â€ he said, in a soft and, as it were, controlled
939987 [3045] voice, â€œthat I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart,
939987 [3046] my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find nothing but a depraved
939987 [3047] profligate, a despicable clown!â€
939987 [3048] 
939987 [3049] â€œA duel!â€ yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at each
939987 [3050] syllable. â€œAnd you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch MiÃ¼sov, let me tell you that
939987 [3051] there has never been in all your family a loftier, and more honestâ€”you
939987 [3052] hearâ€”more honest woman than this â€˜creature,â€™ as you have dared to call
939987 [3053] her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for that
939987 [3054] â€˜creature,â€™ so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldnâ€™t
939987 [3055] hold a candle to her. Thatâ€™s the woman called a â€˜creatureâ€™!â€
939987 [3056] 
939987 [3057] â€œShameful!â€ broke from Father Iosif.
939987 [3058] 
939987 [3059] â€œShameful and disgraceful!â€ Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a boyish
939987 [3060] voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till that moment.
939987 [3061] 
939987 [3062] â€œWhy is such a man alive?â€ Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in a
939987 [3063] hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed.
939987 [3064] â€œTell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?â€ He looked round
939987 [3065] at every one and pointed at the old man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.
939987 [3066] 
939987 [3067] â€œListen, listen, monks, to the parricide!â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [3068] rushing up to Father Iosif. â€œThatâ€™s the answer to your â€˜shameful!â€™ What is
939987 [3069] shameful? That â€˜creature,â€™ that â€˜woman of loose behaviorâ€™ is perhaps
939987 [3070] holier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation! She
939987 [3071] fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved much,
939987 [3072] and Christ himself forgave the woman â€˜who loved much.â€™ â€
939987 [3073] 
939987 [3074] â€œIt was not for such love Christ forgave her,â€ broke impatiently from the
939987 [3075] gentle Father Iosif.
939987 [3076] 
939987 [3077] â€œYes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here, eating
939987 [3078] cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and you
939987 [3079] think you bribe God with gudgeon.â€
939987 [3080] 
939987 [3081] â€œThis is unendurable!â€ was heard on all sides in the cell.
939987 [3082] 
939987 [3083] But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way. Father
939987 [3084] Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with anxiety for
939987 [3085] the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supporting
939987 [3086] him by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank
939987 [3087] on his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness,
939987 [3088] but this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at
939987 [3089] Dmitriâ€™s feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so
939987 [3090] astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a
939987 [3091] faint smile on his lips.
939987 [3092] 
939987 [3093] â€œGood-by! Forgive me, all of you!â€ he said, bowing on all sides to his
939987 [3094] guests.
939987 [3095] 
939987 [3096] Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to himâ€”what did
939987 [3097] it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, â€œOh, God!â€ hid his face in his hands,
939987 [3098] and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after him, in their
939987 [3099] confusion not saying good-by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks went
939987 [3100] up to him again for a blessing.
939987 [3101] 
939987 [3102] â€œWhat did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic or
939987 [3103] what?â€ said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen
939987 [3104] conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They were
939987 [3105] all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.
939987 [3106] 
939987 [3107] â€œI canâ€™t answer for a madhouse and for madmen,â€ MiÃ¼sov answered at once
939987 [3108] ill-humoredly, â€œbut I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [3109] and, trust me, for ever. Whereâ€™s that monk?â€
939987 [3110] 
939987 [3111] â€œThat monk,â€ that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with the
939987 [3112] Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came down
939987 [3113] the steps from the elderâ€™s cell, as though he had been waiting for them
939987 [3114] all the time.
939987 [3115] 
939987 [3116] â€œReverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest respect to the
939987 [3117] Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, MiÃ¼sov, to his reverence,
939987 [3118] telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances I
939987 [3119] am unable to have the honor of being present at his table, greatly as I
939987 [3120] should desire to do so,â€ MiÃ¼sov said irritably to the monk.
939987 [3121] 
939987 [3122] â€œAnd that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,â€ Fyodor
939987 [3123] Pavlovitch cut in immediately. â€œDo you hear, Father; this gentleman
939987 [3124] doesnâ€™t want to remain in my company or else heâ€™d come at once. And you
939987 [3125] shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and good
939987 [3126] appetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home, Iâ€™ll eat at
939987 [3127] home, I donâ€™t feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable
939987 [3128] relative.â€
939987 [3129] 
939987 [3130] â€œI am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible man!â€
939987 [3131] 
939987 [3132] â€œI said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim the
939987 [3133] relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling.
939987 [3134] Iâ€™ll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan, stay if you like.
939987 [3135] Iâ€™ll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires you to go to the
939987 [3136] Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to apologize for the disturbance
939987 [3137] weâ€™ve been making....â€
939987 [3138] 
939987 [3139] â€œIs it true that you are going home? Arenâ€™t you lying?â€
939987 [3140] 
939987 [3141] â€œPyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after whatâ€™s happened! Forgive me,
939987 [3142] gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And, indeed, I am
939987 [3143] ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon and
939987 [3144] another the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog
939987 [3145] Fido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to
939987 [3146] gobble up the monasteryâ€™s sauces? I am ashamed, I canâ€™t. You must excuse
939987 [3147] me!â€
939987 [3148] 
939987 [3149] â€œThe devil only knows, what if he deceives us?â€ thought MiÃ¼sov, still
939987 [3150] hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes. The
939987 [3151] latter turned round, and noticing that MiÃ¼sov was watching him, waved him
939987 [3152] a kiss.
939987 [3153] 
939987 [3154] â€œWell, are you coming to the Superior?â€ MiÃ¼sov asked Ivan abruptly.
939987 [3155] 
939987 [3156] â€œWhy not? I was especially invited yesterday.â€
939987 [3157] 
939987 [3158] â€œUnfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner,â€
939987 [3159] said MiÃ¼sov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact that the
939987 [3160] monk was listening. â€œWe ought, at least, to apologize for the disturbance,
939987 [3161] and explain that it was not our doing. What do you think?â€
939987 [3162] 
939987 [3163] â€œYes, we must explain that it wasnâ€™t our doing. Besides, father wonâ€™t be
939987 [3164] there,â€ observed Ivan.
939987 [3165] 
939987 [3166] â€œWell, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!â€
939987 [3167] 
939987 [3168] They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On the road
939987 [3169] through the copse he made one observation howeverâ€”that the Father Superior
939987 [3170] had been waiting a long time, and that they were more than half an hour
939987 [3171] late. He received no answer. MiÃ¼sov looked with hatred at Ivan.
939987 [3172] 
939987 [3173] â€œHere he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,â€ he
939987 [3174] thought. â€œA brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!â€
939987 [3175] 
939987 [3176] 
939987 [3177] 
939987 [3178] Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career
939987 [3179] 
939987 [3180] 
939987 [3181] Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed. It
939987 [3182] was a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrow
939987 [3183] iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the corner, under
939987 [3184] the ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The
939987 [3185] elder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard.
939987 [3186] He looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
939987 [3187] 
939987 [3188] â€œGo, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are needed
939987 [3189] there, go and wait at the Father Superiorâ€™s table.â€
939987 [3190] 
939987 [3191] â€œLet me stay here,â€ Alyosha entreated.
939987 [3192] 
939987 [3193] â€œYou are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be
939987 [3194] of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, my
939987 [3195] sonâ€â€”the elder liked to call him thatâ€”â€œthis is not the place for you in
939987 [3196] the future. When it is Godâ€™s will to call me, leave the monastery. Go away
939987 [3197] for good.â€
939987 [3198] 
939987 [3199] Alyosha started.
939987 [3200] 
939987 [3201] â€œWhat is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great
939987 [3202] service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have
939987 [3203] to take a wife, too. You will have to bear _all_ before you come back.
939987 [3204] There will be much to do. But I donâ€™t doubt of you, and so I send you
939987 [3205] forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you.
939987 [3206] You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is
939987 [3207] my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.
939987 [3208] Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only my
939987 [3209] days but my hours are numbered.â€
939987 [3210] 
939987 [3211] Alyoshaâ€™s face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouth
939987 [3212] quivered.
939987 [3213] 
939987 [3214] â€œWhat is it again?â€ Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. â€œThe worldly may
939987 [3215] follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who is
939987 [3216] departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go, and
939987 [3217] make haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.â€
939987 [3218] 
939987 [3219] Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make no
939987 [3220] protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover, to
939987 [3221] ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tip
939987 [3222] of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder would have
939987 [3223] explained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it was not his
939987 [3224] will. That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed
939987 [3225] blindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
939987 [3226] 
939987 [3227] As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in
939987 [3228] time to serve at the Father Superiorâ€™s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at
939987 [3229] his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossimaâ€™s
939987 [3230] words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly
939987 [3231] must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how
939987 [3232] could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing
939987 [3233] him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the
939987 [3234] monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He
939987 [3235] hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage,
939987 [3236] and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient
939987 [3237] pines beside the path. He had not far to goâ€”about five hundred paces. He
939987 [3238] expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he
939987 [3239] noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.
939987 [3240] 
939987 [3241] â€œAre you waiting for me?â€ asked Alyosha, overtaking him.
939987 [3242] 
939987 [3243] â€œYes,â€ grinned Rakitin. â€œYou are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know;
939987 [3244] he has a banquet. Thereâ€™s not been such a banquet since the Superior
939987 [3245] entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shanâ€™t be
939987 [3246] there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what
939987 [3247] does that vision mean? Thatâ€™s what I want to ask you.â€
939987 [3248] 
939987 [3249] â€œWhat vision?â€
939987 [3250] 
939987 [3251] â€œThat bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didnâ€™t he tap the ground with
939987 [3252] his forehead, too!â€
939987 [3253] 
939987 [3254] â€œYou speak of Father Zossima?â€
939987 [3255] 
939987 [3256] â€œYes, of Father Zossima.â€
939987 [3257] 
939987 [3258] â€œTapped the ground?â€
939987 [3259] 
939987 [3260] â€œAh, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that
939987 [3261] vision mean?â€
939987 [3262] 
939987 [3263] â€œI donâ€™t know what it means, Misha.â€
939987 [3264] 
939987 [3265] â€œI knew he wouldnâ€™t explain it to you! Thereâ€™s nothing wonderful about it,
939987 [3266] of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the
939987 [3267] performance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it and
939987 [3268] spread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To my
939987 [3269] thinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your
939987 [3270] house stinks of it.â€
939987 [3271] 
939987 [3272] â€œWhat crime?â€
939987 [3273] 
939987 [3274] Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.
939987 [3275] 
939987 [3276] â€œItâ€™ll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your rich
939987 [3277] old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn
939987 [3278] up. If something happens later on, itâ€™ll be: â€˜Ah, the holy man foresaw it,
939987 [3279] prophesied it!â€™ though itâ€™s a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.
939987 [3280] â€˜Ah, but it was symbolic,â€™ theyâ€™ll say, â€˜an allegory,â€™ and the devil knows
939987 [3281] what all! Itâ€™ll be remembered to his glory: â€˜He predicted the crime and
939987 [3282] marked the criminal!â€™ Thatâ€™s always the way with these crazy fanatics;
939987 [3283] they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like
939987 [3284] your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a
939987 [3285] murderer.â€
939987 [3286] 
939987 [3287] â€œWhat crime? What murderer? What do you mean?â€
939987 [3288] 
939987 [3289] Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.
939987 [3290] 
939987 [3291] â€œWhat murderer? As though you didnâ€™t know! Iâ€™ll bet youâ€™ve thought of it
939987 [3292] before. Thatâ€™s interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you always
939987 [3293] speak the truth, though youâ€™re always between two stools. Have you thought
939987 [3294] of it or not? Answer.â€
939987 [3295] 
939987 [3296] â€œI have,â€ answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.
939987 [3297] 
939987 [3298] â€œWhat? Have you really?â€ he cried.
939987 [3299] 
939987 [3300] â€œI ... Iâ€™ve not exactly thought it,â€ muttered Alyosha, â€œbut directly you
939987 [3301] began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.â€
939987 [3302] 
939987 [3303] â€œYou see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and your
939987 [3304] brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then Iâ€™m not mistaken?â€
939987 [3305] 
939987 [3306] â€œBut wait, wait a minute,â€ Alyosha broke in uneasily. â€œWhat has led you to
939987 [3307] see all this? Why does it interest you? Thatâ€™s the first question.â€
939987 [3308] 
939987 [3309] â€œTwo questions, disconnected, but natural. Iâ€™ll deal with them separately.
939987 [3310] What led me to see it? I shouldnâ€™t have seen it, if I hadnâ€™t suddenly
939987 [3311] understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him all
939987 [3312] at once. I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest but
939987 [3313] passionate people have a line which mustnâ€™t be crossed. If it were, heâ€™d
939987 [3314] run at your father with a knife. But your fatherâ€™s a drunken and abandoned
939987 [3315] old sinner, who can never draw the lineâ€”if they both let themselves go,
939987 [3316] theyâ€™ll both come to grief.â€
939987 [3317] 
939987 [3318] â€œNo, Misha, no. If thatâ€™s all, youâ€™ve reassured me. It wonâ€™t come to
939987 [3319] that.â€
939987 [3320] 
939987 [3321] â€œBut why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our Mitya
939987 [3322] (he is stupid, but honest), but heâ€™sâ€”a sensualist. Thatâ€™s the very
939987 [3323] definition and inner essence of him. Itâ€™s your father has handed him on
939987 [3324] his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you, Alyosha, how you
939987 [3325] can have kept your purity. Youâ€™re a Karamazov too, you know! In your
939987 [3326] family sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these three
939987 [3327] sensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts.
939987 [3328] The three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be the
939987 [3329] fourth.â€
939987 [3330] 
939987 [3331] â€œYou are mistaken about that woman. Dmitriâ€”despises her,â€ said Alyosha,
939987 [3332] with a sort of shudder.
939987 [3333] 
939987 [3334] â€œGrushenka? No, brother, he doesnâ€™t despise her. Since he has openly
939987 [3335] abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesnâ€™t despise her. Thereâ€™s something
939987 [3336] here, my dear boy, that you donâ€™t understand yet. A man will fall in love
939987 [3337] with some beauty, with a womanâ€™s body, or even with a part of a womanâ€™s
939987 [3338] body (a sensualist can understand that), and heâ€™ll abandon his own
939987 [3339] children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia,
939987 [3340] too. If heâ€™s honest, heâ€™ll steal; if heâ€™s humane, heâ€™ll murder; if heâ€™s
939987 [3341] faithful, heâ€™ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of womenâ€™s feet, sung of their
939987 [3342] feet in his verse. Others donâ€™t sing their praises, but they canâ€™t look at
939987 [3343] their feet without a thrillâ€”and itâ€™s not only their feet. Contemptâ€™s no
939987 [3344] help here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
939987 [3345] canâ€™t tear himself away.â€
939987 [3346] 
939987 [3347] â€œI understand that,â€ Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
939987 [3348] 
939987 [3349] â€œReally? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the
939987 [3350] first word,â€ said Rakitin, malignantly. â€œThat escaped you unawares, and
939987 [3351] the confessionâ€™s the more precious. So itâ€™s a familiar subject; youâ€™ve
939987 [3352] thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul!
939987 [3353] Youâ€™re a quiet one, Alyosha, youâ€™re a saint, I know, but the devil only
939987 [3354] knows what youâ€™ve thought about, and what you know already! You are pure,
939987 [3355] but youâ€™ve been down into the depths.... Iâ€™ve been watching you a long
939987 [3356] time. Youâ€™re a Karamazov yourself; youâ€™re a thorough Karamazovâ€”no doubt
939987 [3357] birth and selection have something to answer for. Youâ€™re a sensualist from
939987 [3358] your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do you tremble? Is it
939987 [3359] true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along.
939987 [3360] â€˜Iâ€™ll pull off his cassock,â€™ she says. You canâ€™t think how she keeps
939987 [3361] begging me to bring you. I wondered why she took such an interest in you.
939987 [3362] Do you know, sheâ€™s an extraordinary woman, too!â€
939987 [3363] 
939987 [3364] â€œThank her and say Iâ€™m not coming,â€ said Alyosha, with a strained smile.
939987 [3365] â€œFinish what you were saying, Misha. Iâ€™ll tell you my idea after.â€
939987 [3366] 
939987 [3367] â€œThereâ€™s nothing to finish. Itâ€™s all clear. Itâ€™s the same old tune,
939987 [3368] brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
939987 [3369] Ivan? Heâ€™s a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is
939987 [3370] that youâ€™re all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan writes
939987 [3371] theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his own,
939987 [3372] though heâ€™s an atheist, and he admits itâ€™s a fraud himselfâ€”thatâ€™s your
939987 [3373] brother Ivan. Heâ€™s trying to get Mityaâ€™s betrothed for himself, and I
939987 [3374] fancy heâ€™ll succeed, too. And whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s with Mityaâ€™s consent. For
939987 [3375] Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to
939987 [3376] Grushenka. And heâ€™s ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and
939987 [3377] disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
939987 [3378] devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it!
939987 [3379] Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mityaâ€™s way
939987 [3380] now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His mouth waters at the
939987 [3381] sight of her. Itâ€™s simply on her account he made that scene in the cell
939987 [3382] just now, simply because MiÃ¼sov called her an â€˜abandoned creature.â€™ Heâ€™s
939987 [3383] worse than a tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him in
939987 [3384] connection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he
939987 [3385] has suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
939987 [3386] pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And theyâ€™ll
939987 [3387] come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path! But
939987 [3388] Grushenka favors neither of them, sheâ€™s still playing with them, and
939987 [3389] teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of. For though
939987 [3390] she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldnâ€™t marry her, and
939987 [3391] maybe heâ€™ll turn stingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. Thatâ€™s where
939987 [3392] Mityaâ€™s value comes in; he has no money, but heâ€™s ready to marry her. Yes,
939987 [3393] ready to marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina
939987 [3394] Ivanovna, whoâ€™s rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry
939987 [3395] Grushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant,
939987 [3396] Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict
939987 [3397] may well come to pass from all this, and thatâ€™s what your brother Ivan is
939987 [3398] waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. Heâ€™ll carry off
939987 [3399] Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of
939987 [3400] sixty thousand. Thatâ€™s very alluring to start with, for a man of no
939987 [3401] consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he wonâ€™t be wronging Mitya, but
939987 [3402] doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last
939987 [3403] week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud
939987 [3404] that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan,
939987 [3405] he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
939987 [3406] refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. Sheâ€™s hesitating between the two of
939987 [3407] them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship
939987 [3408] him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.â€
939987 [3409] 
939987 [3410] â€œHow do you know? How can you speak so confidently?â€ Alyosha asked
939987 [3411] sharply, frowning.
939987 [3412] 
939987 [3413] â€œWhy do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know
939987 [3414] Iâ€™m speaking the truth.â€
939987 [3415] 
939987 [3416] â€œYou donâ€™t like Ivan. Ivan wouldnâ€™t be tempted by money.â€
939987 [3417] 
939987 [3418] â€œReally? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? Itâ€™s not only the money,
939987 [3419] though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.â€
939987 [3420] 
939987 [3421] â€œIvan is above that. He wouldnâ€™t make up to any one for thousands. It is
939987 [3422] not money, itâ€™s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps itâ€™s suffering he is
939987 [3423] seeking.â€
939987 [3424] 
939987 [3425] â€œWhat wild dream now? Oh, youâ€”aristocrats!â€
939987 [3426] 
939987 [3427] â€œAh, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted
939987 [3428] by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who donâ€™t want millions,
939987 [3429] but an answer to their questions.â€
939987 [3430] 
939987 [3431] â€œThatâ€™s plagiarism, Alyosha. Youâ€™re quoting your elderâ€™s phrases. Ah, Ivan
939987 [3432] has set you a problem!â€ cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice. His face
939987 [3433] changed, and his lips twitched. â€œAnd the problemâ€™s a stupid one. It is no
939987 [3434] good guessing it. Rack your brainsâ€”youâ€™ll understand it. His article is
939987 [3435] absurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid theory just now: if
939987 [3436] thereâ€™s no immortality of the soul, then thereâ€™s no virtue, and everything
939987 [3437] is lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried
939987 [3438] out: â€˜I will remember!â€™) An attractive theory for scoundrels!â€”(Iâ€™m being
939987 [3439] abusive, thatâ€™s stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic _poseurs_,
939987 [3440] â€˜haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.â€™ Heâ€™s showing off, and what it all
939987 [3441] comes to is, â€˜on the one hand we cannot but admitâ€™ and â€˜on the other it
939987 [3442] must be confessed!â€™ His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in
939987 [3443] itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality.
939987 [3444] It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity.â€
939987 [3445] 
939987 [3446] Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
939987 [3447] though remembering something, he stopped short.
939987 [3448] 
939987 [3449] â€œWell, thatâ€™s enough,â€ he said, with a still more crooked smile. â€œWhy are
939987 [3450] you laughing? Do you think Iâ€™m a vulgar fool?â€
939987 [3451] 
939987 [3452] â€œNo, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but ...
939987 [3453] never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot about it,
939987 [3454] Misha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina
939987 [3455] Ivanovna yourself; Iâ€™ve suspected that for a long time, brother, thatâ€™s
939987 [3456] why you donâ€™t like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?â€
939987 [3457] 
939987 [3458] â€œAnd jealous of her money, too? Wonâ€™t you add that?â€
939987 [3459] 
939987 [3460] â€œIâ€™ll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.â€
939987 [3461] 
939987 [3462] â€œI believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivan
939987 [3463] with you. Donâ€™t you understand that one might very well dislike him, apart
939987 [3464] from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? He
939987 [3465] condescends to abuse me, you know. Why havenâ€™t I a right to abuse him?â€
939987 [3466] 
939987 [3467] â€œI never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He doesnâ€™t
939987 [3468] speak of you at all.â€
939987 [3469] 
939987 [3470] â€œBut I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s he was
939987 [3471] abusing me for all he was worthâ€”you see what an interest he takes in your
939987 [3472] humble servant. And which is the jealous one after that, brother, I canâ€™t
939987 [3473] say. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if I donâ€™t go in for
939987 [3474] the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and donâ€™t become a
939987 [3475] monk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid
939987 [3476] magazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and in
939987 [3477] the end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal
939987 [3478] and atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of
939987 [3479] socialism, but keeping a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in
939987 [3480] with both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brotherâ€™s
939987 [3481] account, the tinge of socialism wonâ€™t hinder me from laying by the
939987 [3482] proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the
939987 [3483] end of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my
939987 [3484] publishing offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
939987 [3485] even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the Neva,
939987 [3486] which they say is to be built in Petersburg.â€
939987 [3487] 
939987 [3488] â€œAh, Misha, thatâ€™s just what will really happen, every word of it,â€ cried
939987 [3489] Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
939987 [3490] 
939987 [3491] â€œYou are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [3492] 
939987 [3493] â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m joking, forgive me. Iâ€™ve something quite different in my
939987 [3494] mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You canâ€™t have been
939987 [3495] at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s yourself when he was talking about you?â€
939987 [3496] 
939987 [3497] â€œI wasnâ€™t there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it with
939987 [3498] my own ears; if you want to know, he didnâ€™t tell me, but I overheard him,
939987 [3499] unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in Grushenkaâ€™s bedroom and I
939987 [3500] couldnâ€™t go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room.â€
939987 [3501] 
939987 [3502] â€œOh, yes, Iâ€™d forgotten she was a relation of yours.â€
939987 [3503] 
939987 [3504] â€œA relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!â€ cried Rakitin, turning
939987 [3505] crimson. â€œAre you mad? Youâ€™re out of your mind!â€
939987 [3506] 
939987 [3507] â€œWhy, isnâ€™t she a relation of yours? I heard so.â€
939987 [3508] 
939987 [3509] â€œWhere can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient,
939987 [3510] noble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon at
939987 [3511] other menâ€™s tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor. I may
939987 [3512] be only a priestâ€™s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but
939987 [3513] donâ€™t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too,
939987 [3514] Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldnâ€™t be a relation of Grushenka, a common
939987 [3515] harlot. I beg you to understand that!â€
939987 [3516] 
939987 [3517] Rakitin was intensely irritated.
939987 [3518] 
939987 [3519] â€œForgive me, for goodnessâ€™ sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you
939987 [3520] call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?â€ Alyosha flushed
939987 [3521] suddenly. â€œI tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. You
939987 [3522] often go to see her, and you told me yourself youâ€™re not her lover. I
939987 [3523] never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she
939987 [3524] really deserve it?â€
939987 [3525] 
939987 [3526] â€œI may have reasons of my own for visiting her. Thatâ€™s not your business.
939987 [3527] But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely
939987 [3528] to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. Youâ€™d better go to the
939987 [3529] kitchen. Hullo! whatâ€™s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They canâ€™t have
939987 [3530] finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No
939987 [3531] doubt they have. Hereâ€™s your father and your brother Ivan after him.
939987 [3532] Theyâ€™ve broken out from the Father Superiorâ€™s. And look, Father Isidorâ€™s
939987 [3533] shouting out something after them from the steps. And your fatherâ€™s
939987 [3534] shouting and waving his arms. I expect heâ€™s swearing. Bah, and there goes
939987 [3535] MiÃ¼sov driving away in his carriage. You see, heâ€™s going. And thereâ€™s old
939987 [3536] Maximov running!â€”there must have been a row. There canâ€™t have been any
939987 [3537] dinner. Surely theyâ€™ve not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they,
939987 [3538] perhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!â€
939987 [3539] 
939987 [3540] There was reason for Rakitinâ€™s exclamations. There had been a scandalous,
939987 [3541] an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.
939987 [3542] 
939987 [3543] 
939987 [3544] 
939987 [3545] Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene
939987 [3546] 
939987 [3547] 
939987 [3548] MiÃ¼sov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inward
939987 [3549] qualms, when he reached the Father Superiorâ€™s with Ivan: he felt ashamed
939987 [3550] of having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdained that
939987 [3551] despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him
939987 [3552] in Father Zossimaâ€™s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. â€œThe monks
939987 [3553] were not to blame, in any case,â€ he reflected, on the steps. â€œAnd if
939987 [3554] theyâ€™re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
939987 [3555] nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I wonâ€™t argue, Iâ€™ll
939987 [3556] fall in with everything, Iâ€™ll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
939987 [3557] them that Iâ€™ve nothing to do with that Ã†sop, that buffoon, that Pierrot,
939987 [3558] and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.â€
939987 [3559] 
939987 [3560] He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish
939987 [3561] his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the more
939987 [3562] ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he
939987 [3563] had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.
939987 [3564] 
939987 [3565] These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father
939987 [3566] Superiorâ€™s dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a
939987 [3567] dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they
939987 [3568] were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossimaâ€™s. But
939987 [3569] there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. The
939987 [3570] furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned
939987 [3571] style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining
939987 [3572] with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the
939987 [3573] most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the
939987 [3574] beautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there
939987 [3575] were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of
939987 [3576] excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvasâ€”both the latter made in the
939987 [3577] monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin
939987 [3578] related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of
939987 [3579] sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a
939987 [3580] special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally,
939987 [3581] blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could
939987 [3582] not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He
939987 [3583] had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of
939987 [3584] an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable
939987 [3585] abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he
939987 [3586] would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to
939987 [3587] him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and
939987 [3588] quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that
939987 [3589] because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the
939987 [3590] highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced
939987 [3591] him in that.
939987 [3592] 
939987 [3593] Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invited
939987 [3594] to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father PaÃ¯ssy, and one other monk
939987 [3595] were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were already waiting
939987 [3596] when MiÃ¼sov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a
939987 [3597] little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of
939987 [3598] the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous
939987 [3599] old man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic
939987 [3600] face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to
939987 [3601] receive his blessing. MiÃ¼sov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
939987 [3602] Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov
939987 [3603] went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner,
939987 [3604] kissing his hand as peasants do.
939987 [3605] 
939987 [3606] â€œWe must apologize most humbly, your reverence,â€ began MiÃ¼sov, simpering
939987 [3607] affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. â€œPardon us for
939987 [3608] having come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He
939987 [3609] felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not without
939987 [3610] reason. In the reverend Father Zossimaâ€™s cell he was carried away by the
939987 [3611] unhappy dissension with his son, and let fall words which were quite out
939987 [3612] of keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ... asâ€â€”he glanced at the
939987 [3613] monksâ€”â€œyour reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore,
939987 [3614] recognizing that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame,
939987 [3615] and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
939987 [3616] apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
939987 [3617] later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
939987 [3618] place.â€
939987 [3619] 
939987 [3620] As he uttered the last word of his tirade, MiÃ¼sov completely recovered his
939987 [3621] self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation disappeared. He
939987 [3622] fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
939987 [3623] 
939987 [3624] The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight bend
939987 [3625] of the head, replied:
939987 [3626] 
939987 [3627] â€œI sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have
939987 [3628] learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.â€
939987 [3629] 
939987 [3630] He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent
939987 [3631] their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with
939987 [3632] peculiar fervor.
939987 [3633] 
939987 [3634] It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It
939987 [3635] must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt the
939987 [3636] impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing
939987 [3637] had happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elderâ€™s cell. Not that
939987 [3638] he was so very much ashamed of himselfâ€”quite the contrary perhaps. But
939987 [3639] still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking
939987 [3640] carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had
939987 [3641] hardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own
939987 [3642] words at the elderâ€™s: â€œI always feel when I meet people that I am lower
939987 [3643] than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
939987 [3644] the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.â€ He
939987 [3645] longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness. He
939987 [3646] suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, â€œWhy do you hate
939987 [3647] so and so, so much?â€ And he had answered them, with his shameless
939987 [3648] impudence, â€œIâ€™ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a
939987 [3649] dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.â€
939987 [3650] 
939987 [3651] Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for a
939987 [3652] moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. â€œWell, since I
939987 [3653] have begun, I may as well go on,â€ he decided. His predominant sensation at
939987 [3654] that moment might be expressed in the following words, â€œWell, there is no
939987 [3655] rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
939987 [3656] show them I donâ€™t care what they thinkâ€”thatâ€™s all!â€
939987 [3657] 
939987 [3658] He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to the
939987 [3659] monastery and straight to the Father Superiorâ€™s. He had no clear idea what
939987 [3660] he would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that a
939987 [3661] touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only to
939987 [3662] obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be legally
939987 [3663] punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had
939987 [3664] marveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeared in the
939987 [3665] Father Superiorâ€™s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and
939987 [3666] all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the
939987 [3667] company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
939987 [3668] them all boldly in the face. â€œThey thought I had gone, and here I am
939987 [3669] again,â€ he cried to the whole room.
939987 [3670] 
939987 [3671] For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once every
939987 [3672] one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, was
939987 [3673] about to happen. MiÃ¼sov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame
939987 [3674] of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died
939987 [3675] down in his heart revived instantly.
939987 [3676] 
939987 [3677] â€œNo! this I cannot endure!â€ he cried. â€œI absolutely cannot! and ... I
939987 [3678] certainly cannot!â€
939987 [3679] 
939987 [3680] The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyond
939987 [3681] thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
939987 [3682] 
939987 [3683] â€œWhat is it he cannot?â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, â€œthat he absolutely
939987 [3684] cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will
939987 [3685] you receive me as your guest?â€
939987 [3686] 
939987 [3687] â€œYou are welcome with all my heart,â€ answered the Superior. â€œGentlemen!â€
939987 [3688] he added, â€œI venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your
939987 [3689] dissensions, and to be united in love and family harmonyâ€”with prayer to
939987 [3690] the Lord at our humble table.â€
939987 [3691] 
939987 [3692] â€œNo, no, it is impossible!â€ cried MiÃ¼sov, beside himself.
939987 [3693] 
939987 [3694] â€œWell, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for
939987 [3695] me, and I wonâ€™t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr
939987 [3696] Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
939987 [3697] I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what
939987 [3698] you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my
939987 [3699] relation. Thatâ€™s right, isnâ€™t it, von Sohn? Hereâ€™s von Sohn. How are you,
939987 [3700] von Sohn?â€
939987 [3701] 
939987 [3702] â€œDo you mean me?â€ muttered Maximov, puzzled.
939987 [3703] 
939987 [3704] â€œOf course I mean you,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. â€œWho else? The Father
939987 [3705] Superior could not be von Sohn.â€
939987 [3706] 
939987 [3707] â€œBut I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.â€
939987 [3708] 
939987 [3709] â€œNo, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It
939987 [3710] was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotryâ€”I believe
939987 [3711] that is what such places are called among youâ€”he was killed and robbed,
939987 [3712] and in spite of his venerable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from
939987 [3713] Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing him
939987 [3714] up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano.
939987 [3715] So this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasnâ€™t he, von
939987 [3716] Sohn?â€
939987 [3717] 
939987 [3718] â€œWhat is happening? Whatâ€™s this?â€ voices were heard in the group of monks.
939987 [3719] 
939987 [3720] â€œLet us go,â€ cried MiÃ¼sov, addressing Kalganov.
939987 [3721] 
939987 [3722] â€œNo, excuse me,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another step
939987 [3723] into the room. â€œAllow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me for
939987 [3724] behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr
939987 [3725] Alexandrovitch. MiÃ¼sov, my relation, prefers to have _plus de noblesse que
939987 [3726] de sincÃ©ritÃ©_ in his words, but I prefer in mine _plus de sincÃ©ritÃ© que de
939987 [3727] noblesse_, andâ€”damn the _noblesse_! Thatâ€™s right, isnâ€™t it, von Sohn?
939987 [3728] Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet
939987 [3729] I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of
939987 [3730] honor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing
939987 [3731] else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
939987 [3732] Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and
939987 [3733] it is my duty to care. While Iâ€™ve been playing the fool, I have been
939987 [3734] listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the
939987 [3735] last act of the performance. You know how things are with us? As a thing
939987 [3736] falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever.
939987 [3737] Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with
939987 [3738] you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down
939987 [3739] reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud.
939987 [3740] Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
939987 [3741] confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it
939987 [3742] was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this
939987 [3743] and that ... well, you understand whatâ€”sometimes it would not be proper to
939987 [3744] talk about itâ€”so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried
939987 [3745] along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunity
939987 [3746] I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.â€
939987 [3747] 
939987 [3748] We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak
939987 [3749] spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached
939987 [3750] the Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others where the
939987 [3751] institution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the
939987 [3752] elders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that the
939987 [3753] elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so onâ€”absurd
939987 [3754] charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of
939987 [3755] folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the
939987 [3756] current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
939987 [3757] prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a
939987 [3758] word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no
939987 [3759] one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elderâ€™s cell, so that he
939987 [3760] could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from
939987 [3761] confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish
939987 [3762] tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to
939987 [3763] prove to his audience, and above all to himself, that he had not been
939987 [3764] talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word
939987 [3765] he would be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
939987 [3766] and plunged forward blindly.
939987 [3767] 
939987 [3768] â€œHow disgraceful!â€ cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
939987 [3769] 
939987 [3770] â€œPardon me!â€ said the Father Superior. â€œIt was said of old, â€˜Many have
939987 [3771] begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And
939987 [3772] hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He
939987 [3773] has sent it to heal my vain soul.â€™ And so we humbly thank you, honored
939987 [3774] guest!â€ and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.
939987 [3775] 
939987 [3776] â€œTutâ€”tutâ€”tutâ€”sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old
939987 [3777] gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. A
939987 [3778] kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schillerâ€™s _Robbers_. I
939987 [3779] donâ€™t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to
939987 [3780] be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do
939987 [3781] you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward
939987 [3782] like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being
939987 [3783] virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in
939987 [3784] a monastery at other peopleâ€™s expense, and without expecting a reward up
939987 [3785] aloft for itâ€”youâ€™ll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father
939987 [3786] Superior. What have they got here?â€ He went up to the table. â€œOld port
939987 [3787] wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is
939987 [3788] something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought
939987 [3789] out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the
939987 [3790] laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it
939987 [3791] from his family and the tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy
939987 [3792] fathers.â€
939987 [3793] 
939987 [3794] â€œThis is too disgraceful!â€ said Father Iosif.
939987 [3795] 
939987 [3796] Father PaÃ¯ssy kept obstinately silent. MiÃ¼sov rushed from the room, and
939987 [3797] Kalganov after him.
939987 [3798] 
939987 [3799] â€œWell, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see
939987 [3800] you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shanâ€™t come. I sent you a
939987 [3801] thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No,
939987 [3802] Iâ€™ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the
939987 [3803] humiliation I endured.â€ He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm
939987 [3804] of simulated feeling. â€œThis monastery has played a great part in my life!
939987 [3805] It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
939987 [3806] against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me
939987 [3807] all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the
939987 [3808] age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles,
939987 [3809] no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!â€
939987 [3810] 
939987 [3811] It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part
939987 [3812] in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was
939987 [3813] so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one moment
939987 [3814] almost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But
939987 [3815] at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.
939987 [3816] 
939987 [3817] The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke
939987 [3818] impressively:
939987 [3819] 
939987 [3820] â€œIt is written again, â€˜Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh
939987 [3821] upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who
939987 [3822] hath dishonored thee.â€™ And so will we.â€
939987 [3823] 
939987 [3824] â€œTut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink
939987 [3825] yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from
939987 [3826] here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most
939987 [3827] dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you
939987 [3828] to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only
939987 [3829] one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and
939987 [3830] kasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... Iâ€™ve
939987 [3831] cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, donâ€™t lose your chance.â€ He went out,
939987 [3832] shouting and gesticulating.
939987 [3833] 
939987 [3834] It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.
939987 [3835] 
939987 [3836] â€œAlexey!â€ his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. â€œYou
939987 [3837] come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, and
939987 [3838] leave no trace behind.â€
939987 [3839] 
939987 [3840] Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
939987 [3841] Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was about
939987 [3842] to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good-by to
939987 [3843] Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque
939987 [3844] buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly
939987 [3845] appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being
939987 [3846] too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was in such a hurry that
939987 [3847] in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivanâ€™s left foot
939987 [3848] was still resting, and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in.
939987 [3849] â€œI am going with you!â€ he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh
939987 [3850] with a look of reckless glee in his face. â€œTake me, too.â€
939987 [3851] 
939987 [3852] â€œThere!â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. â€œDid I not say he was von
939987 [3853] Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear
939987 [3854] yourself away? What did you _vonsohn_ there? And how could you get away
939987 [3855] from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but
939987 [3856] I am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It
939987 [3857] will be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet,
939987 [3858] von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von
939987 [3859] Sohn!â€
939987 [3860] 
939987 [3861] But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a
939987 [3862] violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance he
939987 [3863] did not fall.
939987 [3864] 
939987 [3865] â€œDrive on!â€ Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
939987 [3866] 
939987 [3867] â€œWhy, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?â€ Fyodor
939987 [3868] Pavlovitch protested.
939987 [3869] 
939987 [3870] But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
939987 [3871] 
939987 [3872] â€œWell, you are a fellow,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
939987 [3873] 
939987 [3874] After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, â€œWhy, it was you
939987 [3875] got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Why
939987 [3876] are you angry now?â€
939987 [3877] 
939987 [3878] â€œYouâ€™ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,â€ Ivan snapped
939987 [3879] sullenly.
939987 [3880] 
939987 [3881] Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
939987 [3882] 
939987 [3883] â€œA drop of brandy would be nice now,â€ he observed sententiously, but Ivan
939987 [3884] made no response.
939987 [3885] 
939987 [3886] â€œYou shall have some, too, when we get home.â€
939987 [3887] 
939987 [3888] Ivan was still silent.
939987 [3889] 
939987 [3890] Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
939987 [3891] 
939987 [3892] â€œBut I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike
939987 [3893] it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.â€
939987 [3894] 
939987 [3895] Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the
939987 [3896] road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

939987 [3902] 
939987 [3903] 
939987 [3904] 
939987 [3905] Chapter I. In The Servantsâ€™ Quarters
939987 [3906] 
939987 [3907] 
939987 [3908] The Karamazovsâ€™ house was far from being in the center of the town, but it
939987 [3909] was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old house of two
939987 [3910] stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, and
939987 [3911] might still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little
939987 [3912] cupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but Fyodor
939987 [3913] Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. â€œOne doesnâ€™t feel so solitary
939987 [3914] when oneâ€™s left alone in the evening,â€ he used to say. It was his habit to
939987 [3915] send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up
939987 [3916] alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor
939987 [3917] Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was a
939987 [3918] kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter
939987 [3919] and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
939987 [3920] house was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many,
939987 [3921] with their servants. But at the time of our story there was no one living
939987 [3922] in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodge
939987 [3923] there were only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a
939987 [3924] young man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Of
939987 [3925] old Grigory we have said something already. He was firm and determined and
939987 [3926] went blindly and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought
939987 [3927] by any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that
939987 [3928] it was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa
939987 [3929] Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husbandâ€™s will implicitly all her life, yet she
939987 [3930] had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was set
939987 [3931] on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with
939987 [3932] their small savings. But Grigory decided then, once for all, that â€œthe
939987 [3933] womanâ€™s talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,â€ and that they
939987 [3934] ought not to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for â€œthat was
939987 [3935] now their duty.â€
939987 [3936] 
939987 [3937] â€œDo you understand what duty is?â€ he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
939987 [3938] 
939987 [3939] â€œI understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why itâ€™s our
939987 [3940] duty to stay here I never shall understand,â€ Marfa answered firmly.
939987 [3941] 
939987 [3942] â€œWell, donâ€™t understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your
939987 [3943] tongue.â€
939987 [3944] 
939987 [3945] And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a
939987 [3946] small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too, that he had
939987 [3947] an indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and he was aware
939987 [3948] of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though
939987 [3949] his will was strong enough â€œin some of the affairs of life,â€ as he
939987 [3950] expressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in
939987 [3951] facing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of
939987 [3952] them. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
939987 [3953] thatâ€™s not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
939987 [3954] trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [3955] had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigoryâ€™s intervention,
939987 [3956] and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But it
939987 [3957] wasnâ€™t only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were
939987 [3958] graver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor
939987 [3959] Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one
939987 [3960] faithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
939987 [3961] moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his
939987 [3962] lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in
939987 [3963] moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral
939987 [3964] convulsion which took an almost physical form. â€œMy soulâ€™s simply quaking
939987 [3965] in my throat at those times,â€ he used to say. At such moments he liked to
939987 [3966] feel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a
939987 [3967] strong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his
939987 [3968] debauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to
939987 [3969] overlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or
939987 [3970] threaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in
939987 [3971] case of need, to defend himâ€”from whom? From somebody unknown, but terrible
939987 [3972] and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was _another_ man, an
939987 [3973] old and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely to
939987 [3974] look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with
939987 [3975] him. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he
939987 [3976] were angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however)
939987 [3977] that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
939987 [3978] fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would
939987 [3979] begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go
939987 [3980] again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor
939987 [3981] Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the
939987 [3982] just. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on
939987 [3983] Alyoshaâ€™s arrival. Alyosha â€œpierced his heartâ€ by â€œliving with him, seeing
939987 [3984] everything and blaming nothing.â€ Moreover, Alyosha brought with him
939987 [3985] something his father had never known before: a complete absence of
939987 [3986] contempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural
939987 [3987] unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was
939987 [3988] a complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
939987 [3989] ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till then
939987 [3990] loved nothing but â€œevil.â€ When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to
939987 [3991] himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to
939987 [3992] learn.
939987 [3993] 
939987 [3994] I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna, the
939987 [3995] first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he had,
939987 [3996] on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor â€œcrazy woman,â€ against
939987 [3997] his master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His
939987 [3998] sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him, so that
939987 [3999] even now, twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to
939987 [4000] her from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
939987 [4001] Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words,
939987 [4002] without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he
939987 [4003] loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she knew
939987 [4004] it.
939987 [4005] 
939987 [4006] Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
939987 [4007] cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he in worldly
939987 [4008] affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without question or
939987 [4009] complaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for his spiritual
939987 [4010] superiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the
939987 [4011] course of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs. The
939987 [4012] grave and dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone,
939987 [4013] so that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did not
939987 [4014] need her advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
939987 [4015] it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once, and then
939987 [4016] only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s marriage
939987 [4017] with AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna, the village girls and womenâ€”at that time
939987 [4018] serfsâ€”were called together before the house to sing and dance. They were
939987 [4019] beginning â€œIn the Green Meadows,â€ when Marfa, at that time a young woman,
939987 [4020] skipped forward and danced â€œthe Russian Dance,â€ not in the village
939987 [4021] fashion, but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of
939987 [4022] the rich MiÃ¼sov family, in their private theater, where the actors were
939987 [4023] taught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wife
939987 [4024] danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson,
939987 [4025] pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was never
939987 [4026] repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
939987 [4027] 
939987 [4028] God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died.
939987 [4029] Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. When
939987 [4030] AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of three
939987 [4031] years old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands, and
939987 [4032] looked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan
939987 [4033] and Alyosha, for which the generalâ€™s widow had rewarded him with a slap in
939987 [4034] the face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his own
939987 [4035] child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it
939987 [4036] was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had six
939987 [4037] fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only silent till
939987 [4038] the day of the christening, but kept away in the garden. It was spring,
939987 [4039] and he spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day was
939987 [4040] fixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a
939987 [4041] conclusion. Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the
939987 [4042] visitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand
939987 [4043] god-father, he suddenly announced that the baby â€œought not to be
939987 [4044] christened at all.â€ He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his
939987 [4045] words, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest.
939987 [4046] 
939987 [4047] â€œWhy not?â€ asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
939987 [4048] 
939987 [4049] â€œBecause itâ€™s a dragon,â€ muttered Grigory.
939987 [4050] 
939987 [4051] â€œA dragon? What dragon?â€
939987 [4052] 
939987 [4053] Grigory did not speak for some time. â€œItâ€™s a confusion of nature,â€ he
939987 [4054] muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.
939987 [4055] 
939987 [4056] They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayed
939987 [4057] earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child remained
939987 [4058] unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sickly
939987 [4059] infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, and
939987 [4060] for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of a
939987 [4061] fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its
939987 [4062] little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling
939987 [4063] up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the
939987 [4064] earth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfa
939987 [4065] speak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, she
939987 [4066] never spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day of
939987 [4067] the burial, he devoted himself to â€œreligion,â€ and took to reading the
939987 [4068] _Lives of the Saints_, for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and
939987 [4069] always putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read
939987 [4070] aloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had
939987 [4071] somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of â€œthe God-fearing
939987 [4072] Father Isaac the Syrian,â€ which he read persistently for years together,
939987 [4073] understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the
939987 [4074] more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect
939987 [4075] of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood. He was evidently shaken by
939987 [4076] them, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His habit of
939987 [4077] theological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity.
939987 [4078] 
939987 [4079] He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformed
939987 [4080] child, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompanied
939987 [4081] by another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said later, had left
939987 [4082] a â€œstampâ€ upon his soul. It happened that, on the very night after the
939987 [4083] burial of his child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of a new-born baby.
939987 [4084] She was frightened and waked her husband. He listened and said he thought
939987 [4085] it was more like some one groaning, â€œit might be a woman.â€ He got up and
939987 [4086] dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
939987 [4087] distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard
939987 [4088] into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of
939987 [4089] entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going
939987 [4090] back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and
939987 [4091] taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still
939987 [4092] persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby
939987 [4093] crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he
939987 [4094] heard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near the
939987 [4095] garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of
939987 [4096] the bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who
939987 [4097] wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname
939987 [4098] of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the
939987 [4099] bath-house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
939987 [4100] baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak.
939987 [4101] But her story needs a chapter to itself.
939987 [4102] 
939987 [4103] 
939987 [4104] 
939987 [4105] Chapter II. Lizaveta
939987 [4106] 
939987 [4107] 
939987 [4108] There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and
939987 [4109] confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a
939987 [4110] dwarfish creature, â€œnot five foot within a wee bit,â€ as many of the pious
939987 [4111] old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad,
939987 [4112] healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her
939987 [4113] eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered
939987 [4114] about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen
939987 [4115] smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lambâ€™s wool, and formed a
939987 [4116] sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had
939987 [4117] leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on
939987 [4118] the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
939987 [4119] called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with
939987 [4120] some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and
939987 [4121] diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to
939987 [4122] him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look
939987 [4123] after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilyaâ€™s
939987 [4124] employers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople,
939987 [4125] tried to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots and
939987 [4126] sheepskin coat for the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress her
939987 [4127] up without resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral
939987 [4128] porch, and taking off all that had been given herâ€”kerchief, sheepskin,
939987 [4129] skirt or bootsâ€”she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock
939987 [4130] as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the
939987 [4131] province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was
939987 [4132] wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told she was
939987 [4133] an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about
939987 [4134] in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur
939987 [4135] again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At
939987 [4136] last her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
939987 [4137] the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemed
939987 [4138] to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town,
939987 [4139] especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk into
939987 [4140] strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her and
939987 [4141] gave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and at
939987 [4142] once drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a
939987 [4143] roll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met.
939987 [4144] Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it
939987 [4145] to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted
939987 [4146] anything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
939987 [4147] where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on
939987 [4148] her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by
939987 [4149] them, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to
939987 [4150] church. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle
939987 [4151] (there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a
939987 [4152] kitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up â€œat home,â€ that
939987 [4153] is at the house of her fatherâ€™s former employers, and in the winter went
939987 [4154] there every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People
939987 [4155] were amazed that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to
939987 [4156] it, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some
939987 [4157] of the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
939987 [4158] that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from time to
939987 [4159] time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?
939987 [4160] 
939987 [4161] It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago)
939987 [4162] five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late
939987 [4163] hour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through the
939987 [4164] â€œback-way,â€ which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdles
939987 [4165] on either side. This way leads out on to the bridge over the long,
939987 [4166] stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles
939987 [4167] and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They
939987 [4168] stopped to look at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled
939987 [4169] licentiousness. It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical
939987 [4170] inquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
939987 [4171] woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it
939987 [4172] was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward
939987 [4173] and declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, there
939987 [4174] was a certain piquancy about it, and so on.... It is true that at that
939987 [4175] time he was overdoing his part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself
939987 [4176] forward and entertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course,
939987 [4177] though in reality he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at
939987 [4178] the time when he had received the news of his first wifeâ€™s death in
939987 [4179] Petersburg, and, with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so
939987 [4180] shamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight
939987 [4181] of him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and
939987 [4182] one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelled
939987 [4183] the idea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity,
939987 [4184] and at last they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that
939987 [4185] he had gone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for certain,
939987 [4186] and no one ever knew. But five or six months later, all the town was
939987 [4187] talking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizavetaâ€™s condition,
939987 [4188] and trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then
939987 [4189] suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
939987 [4190] other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of that drunken
939987 [4191] band five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderly
939987 [4192] and much respected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, who
939987 [4193] could hardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundation
939987 [4194] for it. But rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in
939987 [4195] pointing at him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would
939987 [4196] not have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
939987 [4197] was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the
939987 [4198] officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
939987 [4199] 
939987 [4200] At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provoked
939987 [4201] quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing some
939987 [4202] people round to his side. â€œItâ€™s the wenchâ€™s own fault,â€ he asserted, and
939987 [4203] the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and
939987 [4204] whose name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. This
939987 [4205] conjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been in
939987 [4206] the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three
939987 [4207] people. But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular
939987 [4208] sympathy from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
939987 [4209] well-to-do merchantâ€™s widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into her
939987 [4210] house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after the
939987 [4211] confinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite of their
939987 [4212] vigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made her way into Fyodor
939987 [4213] Pavlovitchâ€™s garden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over the
939987 [4214] high, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have
939987 [4215] been lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
939987 [4216] most likely explanation is that it happened naturallyâ€”that Lizaveta,
939987 [4217] accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
939987 [4218] managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt
939987 [4219] down, injuring herself.
939987 [4220] 
939987 [4221] Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an
939987 [4222] old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at
939987 [4223] dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit
939987 [4224] down, put it on her lap. â€œA child of Godâ€”an orphan is akin to all,â€ he
939987 [4225] said, â€œand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who
939987 [4226] has come from the devilâ€™s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no
939987 [4227] more.â€
939987 [4228] 
939987 [4229] So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people
939987 [4230] were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [4231] did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted
939987 [4232] vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at
939987 [4233] his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname
939987 [4234] for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his motherâ€™s nickname.
939987 [4235] 
939987 [4236] So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s second servant, and was
939987 [4237] living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.
939987 [4238] He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but
939987 [4239] I am ashamed of keeping my readersâ€™ attention so long occupied with these
939987 [4240] common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of
939987 [4241] Smerdyakov in the course of it.

939987 [4245] Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heartâ€”In Verse
939987 [4246] 
939987 [4247] 
939987 [4248] Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his
939987 [4249] father shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness he
939987 [4250] did not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchen
939987 [4251] to find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off,
939987 [4252] trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting
939987 [4253] him. I hasten to add that his fatherâ€™s shouts, commanding him to return
939987 [4254] home â€œwith his mattress and pillowâ€ did not frighten him in the least. He
939987 [4255] understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely â€œa flourishâ€
939987 [4256] to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who was
939987 [4257] celebrating his name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at being
939987 [4258] refused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his
939987 [4259] own and his wifeâ€™s clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for the
939987 [4260] sake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the
939987 [4261] broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go
939987 [4262] back to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he
939987 [4263] was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not
939987 [4264] hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
939987 [4265] want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him.
939987 [4266] This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he
939987 [4267] went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
939987 [4268] 
939987 [4269] But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and
939987 [4270] worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear of
939987 [4271] a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in the
939987 [4272] note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about something.
939987 [4273] This request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy
939987 [4274] feeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful all
939987 [4275] the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father
939987 [4276] Superiorâ€™s. He was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak
939987 [4277] of and what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
939987 [4278] woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life, from early
939987 [4279] childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was
939987 [4280] afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from
939987 [4281] the first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, and
939987 [4282] had only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as a
939987 [4283] beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which troubled
939987 [4284] him, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased
939987 [4285] the apprehension itself. The girlâ€™s aims were of the noblest, he knew
939987 [4286] that. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
939987 [4287] though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
939987 [4288] recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a
939987 [4289] shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.
939987 [4290] 
939987 [4291] He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend,
939987 [4292] with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was even
939987 [4293] more certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. And
939987 [4294] so his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to run
939987 [4295] and see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing
939987 [4296] him the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way
939987 [4297] off, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a
939987 [4298] minute, he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and
939987 [4299] accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
939987 [4300] direction of his terrible lady.
939987 [4301] 
939987 [4302] He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across the
939987 [4303] market-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it is
939987 [4304] scattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father was
939987 [4305] expecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might be
939987 [4306] unreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So he
939987 [4307] decided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the
939987 [4308] ground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing
939987 [4309] other peopleâ€™s back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
939987 [4310] him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
939987 [4311] 
939987 [4312] He had to pass the garden adjoining his fatherâ€™s, and belonging to a
939987 [4313] little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, as
939987 [4314] Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who had
939987 [4315] been a genteel maid-servant in generalsâ€™ families in Petersburg. Now she
939987 [4316] had been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She always dressed
939987 [4317] up in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had sunk into such
939987 [4318] poverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s kitchen for soup
939987 [4319] and bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up
939987 [4320] for soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even had
939987 [4321] a long trainâ€”a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always
939987 [4322] knew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it as soon
939987 [4323] as he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he remembered the dress
939987 [4324] with the train, raised his head, which had been bowed in thought, and came
939987 [4325] upon something quite unexpected.
939987 [4326] 
939987 [4327] Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaning
939987 [4328] forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously afraid to
939987 [4329] utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.
939987 [4330] 
939987 [4331] â€œItâ€™s a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,â€ Mitya
939987 [4332] said in a joyful, hurried whisper. â€œClimb in here quickly! How splendid
939987 [4333] that youâ€™ve come! I was just thinking of you!â€
939987 [4334] 
939987 [4335] Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over the hurdle.
939987 [4336] Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump. Tucking up
939987 [4337] his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a
939987 [4338] bare-legged street urchin.
939987 [4339] 
939987 [4340] â€œWell done! Now come along,â€ said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.
939987 [4341] 
939987 [4342] â€œWhere?â€ whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in a
939987 [4343] deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small, but
939987 [4344] the house was at least fifty paces away.
939987 [4345] 
939987 [4346] â€œThereâ€™s no one here. Why do you whisper?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [4347] 
939987 [4348] â€œWhy do I whisper? Deuce take it!â€ cried Dmitri at the top of his voice.
939987 [4349] â€œYou see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and on
939987 [4350] the watch. Iâ€™ll explain later on, but, knowing itâ€™s a secret, I began
939987 [4351] whispering like a fool, when thereâ€™s no need. Let us go. Over there. Till
939987 [4352] then be quiet. I want to kiss you.
939987 [4353] 
939987 [4354] 
939987 [4355]     Glory to God in the world,
939987 [4356]     Glory to God in me ...
939987 [4357] 
939987 [4358] 
939987 [4359] I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.â€
939987 [4360] 
939987 [4361] The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only
939987 [4362] along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees, maples, limes
939987 [4363] and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, from
939987 [4364] which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer. The garden
939987 [4365] was let out for a few roubles for the summer. There were also plantations
939987 [4366] of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a
939987 [4367] kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.
939987 [4368] 
939987 [4369] Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden. There,
939987 [4370] in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder,
939987 [4371] snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house,
939987 [4372] blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still a
939987 [4373] roof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built.
939987 [4374] There was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a
939987 [4375] retired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It
939987 [4376] was all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the
939987 [4377] woodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table
939987 [4378] fixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which it
939987 [4379] was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his brotherâ€™s
939987 [4380] exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of
939987 [4381] brandy and a wineglass on the table.
939987 [4382] 
939987 [4383] â€œThatâ€™s brandy,â€ Mitya laughed. â€œI see your look: â€˜Heâ€™s drinking again!â€™
939987 [4384] Distrust the apparition.
939987 [4385] 
939987 [4386] 
939987 [4387]     Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,
939987 [4388]     And lay aside thy doubts.
939987 [4389] 
939987 [4390] 
939987 [4391] Iâ€™m not drinking, Iâ€™m only â€˜indulging,â€™ as that pig, your Rakitin, says.
939987 [4392] Heâ€™ll be a civil councilor one day, but heâ€™ll always talk about
939987 [4393] â€˜indulging.â€™ Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you
939987 [4394] to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole worldâ€”in realityâ€”in
939987 [4395] re-al-i-tyâ€”(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!â€
939987 [4396] 
939987 [4397] He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
939987 [4398] 
939987 [4399] â€œNo one but you and one â€˜jadeâ€™ I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. But
939987 [4400] being in love doesnâ€™t mean loving. You may be in love with a woman and yet
939987 [4401] hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit down here by
939987 [4402] the table and Iâ€™ll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. You
939987 [4403] shall keep quiet and Iâ€™ll go on talking, for the time has come. But on
939987 [4404] reflection, you know, Iâ€™d better speak quietly, for hereâ€”hereâ€”you can
939987 [4405] never tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they
939987 [4406] say, â€˜the story will be continued.â€™ Why have I been longing for you? Why
939987 [4407] have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (Itâ€™s five
939987 [4408] days since Iâ€™ve cast anchor here.) Because itâ€™s only to you I can tell
939987 [4409] everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shall
939987 [4410] fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning. Have
939987 [4411] you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a
939987 [4412] pit? Thatâ€™s just how Iâ€™m falling, but not in a dream. And Iâ€™m not afraid,
939987 [4413] and donâ€™t you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. Itâ€™s not
939987 [4414] enjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong
939987 [4415] spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spiritâ€”whatever it is! Let us praise
939987 [4416] nature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all
939987 [4417] green, itâ€™s still summer; four oâ€™clock in the afternoon and the stillness!
939987 [4418] Where were you going?â€
939987 [4419] 
939987 [4420] â€œI was going to fatherâ€™s, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s first.â€
939987 [4421] 
939987 [4422] â€œTo her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you?
939987 [4423] Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my
939987 [4424] ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to
939987 [4425] have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent
939987 [4426] any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to
939987 [4427] see father and her.â€
939987 [4428] 
939987 [4429] â€œDid you really mean to send me?â€ cried Alyosha with a distressed
939987 [4430] expression.
939987 [4431] 
939987 [4432] â€œStay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet,
939987 [4433] be quiet for a time. Donâ€™t be sorry, and donâ€™t cry.â€
939987 [4434] 
939987 [4435] Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.
939987 [4436] 
939987 [4437] â€œSheâ€™s asked you, written to you a letter or something, thatâ€™s why youâ€™re
939987 [4438] going to her? You wouldnâ€™t be going except for that?â€
939987 [4439] 
939987 [4440] â€œHere is her note.â€ Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked
939987 [4441] through it quickly.
939987 [4442] 
939987 [4443] â€œAnd you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by
939987 [4444] the back-way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old
939987 [4445] fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to
939987 [4446] tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven Iâ€™ve
939987 [4447] told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on
939987 [4448] earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And thatâ€™s what I need, that
939987 [4449] some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from
939987 [4450] everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
939987 [4451] and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says,
939987 [4452] â€˜Do this for meâ€™â€”some favor never asked before that could only be asked on
939987 [4453] oneâ€™s deathbedâ€”would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?â€
939987 [4454] 
939987 [4455] â€œI will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [4456] 
939987 [4457] â€œMake haste! Hâ€™m!... Donâ€™t be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worry
939987 [4458] yourself. Thereâ€™s no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a new
939987 [4459] turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you canâ€™t understand ecstasy. But what
939987 [4460] am I saying to him? As though you didnâ€™t understand it. What an ass I am!
939987 [4461] What am I saying? â€˜Be noble, O man!â€™â€”who says that?â€
939987 [4462] 
939987 [4463] Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his work
939987 [4464] lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his elbow on the
939987 [4465] table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.
939987 [4466] 
939987 [4467] â€œAlyosha,â€ said Mitya, â€œyouâ€™re the only one who wonâ€™t laugh. I should like
939987 [4468] to beginâ€”my confessionâ€”with Schillerâ€™s _Hymn to Joy_, _An die Freude_! I
939987 [4469] donâ€™t know German, I only know itâ€™s called that. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™m talking
939987 [4470] nonsense because Iâ€™m drunk. Iâ€™m not a bit drunk. Brandyâ€™s all very well,
939987 [4471] but I need two bottles to make me drunk:
939987 [4472] 
939987 [4473] 
939987 [4474]     Silenus with his rosy phiz
939987 [4475]     Upon his stumbling ass.
939987 [4476] 
939987 [4477] 
939987 [4478] But Iâ€™ve not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and Iâ€™m not Silenus. Iâ€™m not
939987 [4479] Silenus, though I am strong,(1) for Iâ€™ve made a decision once for all.
939987 [4480] Forgive me the pun; youâ€™ll have to forgive me a lot more than puns to-day.
939987 [4481] Donâ€™t be uneasy. Iâ€™m not spinning it out. Iâ€™m talking sense, and Iâ€™ll come
939987 [4482] to the point in a minute. I wonâ€™t keep you in suspense. Stay, how does it
939987 [4483] go?â€
939987 [4484] 
939987 [4485] He raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:
939987 [4486] 
939987 [4487] 
939987 [4488]     â€œWild and fearful in his cavern
939987 [4489]      Hid the naked troglodyte,
939987 [4490]      And the homeless nomad wandered
939987 [4491]      Laying waste the fertile plain.
939987 [4492]      Menacing with spear and arrow
939987 [4493]      In the woods the hunter strayed....
939987 [4494]      Woe to all poor wretches stranded
939987 [4495]      On those cruel and hostile shores!
939987 [4496] 
939987 [4497]     â€œFrom the peak of high Olympus
939987 [4498]      Came the mother Ceres down,
939987 [4499]      Seeking in those savage regions
939987 [4500]      Her lost daughter Proserpine.
939987 [4501]      But the Goddess found no refuge,
939987 [4502]      Found no kindly welcome there,
939987 [4503]      And no temple bearing witness
939987 [4504]      To the worship of the gods.
939987 [4505] 
939987 [4506]     â€œFrom the fields and from the vineyards
939987 [4507]      Came no fruits to deck the feasts,
939987 [4508]      Only flesh of bloodstained victims
939987 [4509]      Smoldered on the altar-fires,
939987 [4510]      And whereâ€™er the grieving goddess
939987 [4511]      Turns her melancholy gaze,
939987 [4512]      Sunk in vilest degradation
939987 [4513]      Man his loathsomeness displays.â€
939987 [4514] 
939987 [4515] 
939987 [4516] Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyoshaâ€™s hand.
939987 [4517] 
939987 [4518] â€œMy dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. Thereâ€™s a
939987 [4519] terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble.
939987 [4520] Donâ€™t think Iâ€™m only a brute in an officerâ€™s uniform, wallowing in dirt
939987 [4521] and drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded manâ€”if only Iâ€™m
939987 [4522] not lying. I pray God Iâ€™m not lying and showing off. I think about that
939987 [4523] man because I am that man myself.
939987 [4524] 
939987 [4525] 
939987 [4526]     Would he purge his soul from vileness
939987 [4527]     And attain to light and worth,
939987 [4528]     He must turn and cling for ever
939987 [4529]     To his ancient Mother Earth.
939987 [4530] 
939987 [4531] 
939987 [4532] But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I donâ€™t
939987 [4533] kiss her. I donâ€™t cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or a
939987 [4534] shepherd? I go on and I donâ€™t know whether Iâ€™m going to shame or to light
939987 [4535] and joy. Thatâ€™s the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle! And
939987 [4536] whenever Iâ€™ve happened to sink into the vilest degradation (and itâ€™s
939987 [4537] always been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres and man. Has it
939987 [4538] reformed me? Never! For Iâ€™m a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit,
939987 [4539] I go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that
939987 [4540] degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths of
939987 [4541] that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me be
939987 [4542] vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is
939987 [4543] shrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I
939987 [4544] love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.
939987 [4545] 
939987 [4546] 
939987 [4547]     Joy everlasting fostereth
939987 [4548]     The soul of all creation,
939987 [4549]     It is her secret ferment fires
939987 [4550]     The cup of life with flame.
939987 [4551]     â€™Tis at her beck the grass hath turned
939987 [4552]     Each blade towards the light
939987 [4553]     And solar systems have evolved
939987 [4554]     From chaos and dark night,
939987 [4555]     Filling the realms of boundless space
939987 [4556]     Beyond the sageâ€™s sight.
939987 [4557]     At bounteous Natureâ€™s kindly breast,
939987 [4558]     All things that breathe drink Joy,
939987 [4559]     And birds and beasts and creeping things
939987 [4560]     All follow where She leads.
939987 [4561]     Her gifts to man are friends in need,
939987 [4562]     The wreath, the foaming must,
939987 [4563]     To angelsâ€”vision of Godâ€™s throne,
939987 [4564]     To insectsâ€”sensual lust.
939987 [4565] 
939987 [4566] 
939987 [4567] But enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness that
939987 [4568] every one would laugh at. But you wonâ€™t laugh. Your eyes are shining, too.
939987 [4569] Enough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gave
939987 [4570] â€œsensual lust.â€
939987 [4571] 
939987 [4572] 
939987 [4573]     To insectsâ€”sensual lust.
939987 [4574] 
939987 [4575] 
939987 [4576] I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we
939987 [4577] Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives in
939987 [4578] you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests, because
939987 [4579] sensual lust is a tempestâ€”worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and
939987 [4580] awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can
939987 [4581] be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet
939987 [4582] and all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man,
939987 [4583] brother, but Iâ€™ve thought a lot about this. Itâ€™s terrible what mysteries
939987 [4584] there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as
939987 [4585] we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I canâ€™t endure
939987 [4586] the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of
939987 [4587] the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. Whatâ€™s still more awful is
939987 [4588] that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal
939987 [4589] of the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on
939987 [4590] fire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too
939987 [4591] broad, indeed. Iâ€™d have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of
939987 [4592] it! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart.
939987 [4593] Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind
939987 [4594] beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing is
939987 [4595] that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are
939987 [4596] fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a man always
939987 [4597] talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.â€

939987 [4599] 
939987 [4600] 
939987 [4601] Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heartâ€”In Anecdote
939987 [4602] 
939987 [4603] 
939987 [4604] â€œI was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent several
939987 [4605] thousand roubles in seducing young girls. Thatâ€™s a swinish invention, and
939987 [4606] there was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didnâ€™t need money
939987 [4607] simply for _that_. With me money is an accessory, the overflow of my
939987 [4608] heart, the framework. To-day she would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out
939987 [4609] of the streets in her place. I entertained them both. I threw away money
939987 [4610] by the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the
939987 [4611] ladies, too, for theyâ€™ll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be
939987 [4612] pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of
939987 [4613] them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths, little
939987 [4614] dark back-alleys behind the main roadâ€”there one finds adventures and
939987 [4615] surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking figuratively,
939987 [4616] brother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in the
939987 [4617] literal sense, but morally there were. If you were like me, youâ€™d know
939987 [4618] what that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I loved
939987 [4619] cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov!
939987 [4620] Once we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was
939987 [4621] dark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girlâ€™s hand, and forced her
939987 [4622] to kiss me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle,
939987 [4623] submissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She
939987 [4624] thought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer (I
939987 [4625] was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didnâ€™t say a word to her for
939987 [4626] five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we were always
939987 [4627] having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fireâ€”a
939987 [4628] fire of gentle indignation. This game only tickled that insect lust I
939987 [4629] cherished in my soul. Five months later she married an official and left
939987 [4630] the town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live
939987 [4631] happily. Observe that I told no one. I didnâ€™t boast of it. Though Iâ€™m full
939987 [4632] of low desires, and love whatâ€™s low, Iâ€™m not dishonorable. Youâ€™re
939987 [4633] blushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this
939987 [4634] was nothing muchâ€”wayside blossoms _Ã  la_ Paul de Kockâ€”though the cruel
939987 [4635] insect had already grown strong in my soul. Iâ€™ve a perfect album of
939987 [4636] reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to break it
939987 [4637] off without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of one
939987 [4638] of them. But thatâ€™s enough. You canâ€™t suppose I brought you here simply to
939987 [4639] talk of such nonsense. No, Iâ€™m going to tell you something more curious;
939987 [4640] and donâ€™t be surprised that Iâ€™m glad to tell you, instead of being
939987 [4641] ashamed.â€
939987 [4642] 
939987 [4643] â€œYou say that because I blushed,â€ Alyosha said suddenly. â€œI wasnâ€™t
939987 [4644] blushing at what you were saying or at what youâ€™ve done. I blushed because
939987 [4645] I am the same as you are.â€
939987 [4646] 
939987 [4647] â€œYou? Come, thatâ€™s going a little too far!â€
939987 [4648] 
939987 [4649] â€œNo, itâ€™s not too far,â€ said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not a
939987 [4650] new one). â€œThe ladderâ€™s the same. Iâ€™m at the bottom step, and youâ€™re
939987 [4651] above, somewhere about the thirteenth. Thatâ€™s how I see it. But itâ€™s all
939987 [4652] the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound
939987 [4653] to go up to the top one.â€
939987 [4654] 
939987 [4655] â€œThen one ought not to step on at all.â€
939987 [4656] 
939987 [4657] â€œAny one who can help it had better not.â€
939987 [4658] 
939987 [4659] â€œBut can you?â€
939987 [4660] 
939987 [4661] â€œI think not.â€
939987 [4662] 
939987 [4663] â€œHush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so.
939987 [4664] That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that sheâ€™d
939987 [4665] devour you one day. There, there, I wonâ€™t! From this field of corruption
939987 [4666] fouled by flies, letâ€™s pass to my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that is
939987 [4667] by every sort of vileness. Although the old man told lies about my
939987 [4668] seducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy,
939987 [4669] though it was only once, and then it did not come off. The old man who has
939987 [4670] reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I
939987 [4671] never told any one about it. Youâ€™re the first, except Ivan, of courseâ€”Ivan
939987 [4672] knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivanâ€™s a tomb.â€
939987 [4673] 
939987 [4674] â€œIvanâ€™s a tomb?â€
939987 [4675] 
939987 [4676] â€œYes.â€
939987 [4677] 
939987 [4678] Alyosha listened with great attention.
939987 [4679] 
939987 [4680] â€œI was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
939987 [4681] like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little
939987 [4682] town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so
939987 [4683] myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although they
939987 [4684] shook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man,
939987 [4685] took a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had
939987 [4686] powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he
939987 [4687] couldnâ€™t do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him
939987 [4688] with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
939987 [4689] really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives,
939987 [4690] both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as
939987 [4691] unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when I
939987 [4692] was there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her motherâ€™s
939987 [4693] sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but
939987 [4694] lively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of
939987 [4695] more charming character than Agafyaâ€”fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna!
939987 [4696] And she wasnâ€™t bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with
939987 [4697] a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had
939987 [4698] not married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but was
939987 [4699] as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in â€˜thatâ€™ way, it was
939987 [4700] pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I
939987 [4701] used to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Many
939987 [4702] women like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it very
939987 [4703] amusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady. She
939987 [4704] and her aunt lived in her fatherâ€™s house with a sort of voluntary
939987 [4705] humility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She was
939987 [4706] a general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever
939987 [4707] dressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without
939987 [4708] asking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didnâ€™t refuse.
939987 [4709] The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one of the
939987 [4710] chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained the
939987 [4711] whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I arrived and joined the
939987 [4712] battalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of the
939987 [4713] colonelâ€™s second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionable
939987 [4714] school in the capital. This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she
939987 [4715] was the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguished
939987 [4716] generalâ€™s family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she too brought
939987 [4717] the colonel no money. She had connections, and that was all. There may
939987 [4718] have been expectations, but they had come to nothing.
939987 [4719] 
939987 [4720] â€œYet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the whole
939987 [4721] town revived. Our most distinguished ladiesâ€”two â€˜Excellenciesâ€™ and a
939987 [4722] colonelâ€™s wifeâ€”and all the rest following their lead, at once took her up
939987 [4723] and gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of the balls and
939987 [4724] picnics, and they got up _tableaux vivants_ in aid of distressed
939987 [4725] governesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of
939987 [4726] my exploits at the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking my
939987 [4727] measure one evening at the battery commanderâ€™s, but I didnâ€™t go up to her,
939987 [4728] as though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an
939987 [4729] evening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed
939987 [4730] her lips scornfully. â€˜Wait a bit. Iâ€™ll have my revenge,â€™ thought I. I
939987 [4731] behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I was
939987 [4732] conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt that â€˜Katenkaâ€™
939987 [4733] was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proud
939987 [4734] and really high-principled; above all, she had education and intellect,
939987 [4735] and I had neither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply
939987 [4736] wanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didnâ€™t seem to
939987 [4737] feel it.
939987 [4738] 
939987 [4739] â€œMeanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
939987 [4740] put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father sent me six
939987 [4741] thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claims
939987 [4742] upon himâ€”settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldnâ€™t
939987 [4743] expect anything more. I didnâ€™t understand a word of it at the time. Until
939987 [4744] I came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I
939987 [4745] havenâ€™t been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father.
939987 [4746] But never mind that, weâ€™ll talk of it later.
939987 [4747] 
939987 [4748] â€œJust as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me
939987 [4749] something that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, were
939987 [4750] dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected of
939987 [4751] irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him.
939987 [4752] And then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil of
939987 [4753] a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I wonâ€™t tell you
939987 [4754] how it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked
939987 [4755] coolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends all
939987 [4756] turned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya
939987 [4757] Ivanovna, with whom Iâ€™d always kept up a friendship, and said, â€˜Do you
939987 [4758] know thereâ€™s a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
939987 [4759] fatherâ€™s accounts?â€™
939987 [4760] 
939987 [4761] â€œ â€˜What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not long
939987 [4762] ago, and everything was all right.â€™
939987 [4763] 
939987 [4764] â€œ â€˜Then it was, but now it isnâ€™t.â€™
939987 [4765] 
939987 [4766] â€œShe was terribly scared.
939987 [4767] 
939987 [4768] â€œ â€˜Donâ€™t frighten me!â€™ she said. â€˜Who told you so?â€™
939987 [4769] 
939987 [4770] â€œ â€˜Donâ€™t be uneasy,â€™ I said, â€˜I wonâ€™t tell any one. You know Iâ€™m as silent
939987 [4771] as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of â€œpossibilities,â€ to add, that when
939987 [4772] they demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he canâ€™t produce it,
939987 [4773] heâ€™ll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age,
939987 [4774] unless you like to send me your young lady secretly. Iâ€™ve just had money
939987 [4775] paid me. Iâ€™ll give her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret
939987 [4776] religiously.â€™
939987 [4777] 
939987 [4778] â€œ â€˜Ah, you scoundrel!â€™â€”thatâ€™s what she said. â€˜You wicked scoundrel! How
939987 [4779] dare you!â€™
939987 [4780] 
939987 [4781] â€œShe went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once more
939987 [4782] that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures, Agafya
939987 [4783] and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels all
939987 [4784] through this business. They genuinely adored their â€˜Katya,â€™ thought her
939987 [4785] far above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her of
939987 [4786] our conversation. I found that out afterwards. She didnâ€™t keep it back,
939987 [4787] and of course that was all I wanted.
939987 [4788] 
939987 [4789] â€œSuddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The old
939987 [4790] lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldnâ€™t leave his room for two
939987 [4791] days, and didnâ€™t hand over the government money. Dr. Kravchenko declared
939987 [4792] that he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long
939987 [4793] time, that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands
939987 [4794] except when the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend
939987 [4795] it to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
939987 [4796] widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to go to the
939987 [4797] fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum to
939987 [4798] the colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interest
939987 [4799] on the loan. But this time (I heard all about it quite by chance from
939987 [4800] Trifonovâ€™s son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in
939987 [4801] the world)â€”this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair.
939987 [4802] The lieutenant-colonel flew to him. â€˜Iâ€™ve never received any money from
939987 [4803] you, and couldnâ€™t possibly have received any.â€™ That was all the answer he
939987 [4804] got. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
939987 [4805] round his head, while theyâ€™re all three busy putting ice on it. All at
939987 [4806] once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to â€˜hand
939987 [4807] over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.â€™ He signed the
939987 [4808] book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying he
939987 [4809] would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barreled
939987 [4810] gun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the gun
939987 [4811] against his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his foot. But
939987 [4812] Agafya, remembering what I had told her, had her suspicions. She stole up
939987 [4813] and peeped into the room just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon
939987 [4814] him from behind, threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the
939987 [4815] ceiling, but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
939987 [4816] him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was
939987 [4817] getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed
939987 [4818] my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the
939987 [4819] door opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [4820] 
939987 [4821] â€œItâ€™s strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in the
939987 [4822] street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two decrepit
939987 [4823] old ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old things, ready
939987 [4824] to do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as two
939987 [4825] cast-iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at once. She walked in
939987 [4826] and looked straight at me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on
939987 [4827] her lips and round her mouth I saw uncertainty.
939987 [4828] 
939987 [4829] â€œ â€˜My sister told me,â€™ she began, â€˜that you would give me 4,500 roubles if
939987 [4830] I came to you for itâ€”myself. I have come ... give me the money!â€™
939987 [4831] 
939987 [4832] â€œShe couldnâ€™t keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice failed
939987 [4833] her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered.
939987 [4834] Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?â€
939987 [4835] 
939987 [4836] â€œMitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,â€ said Alyosha in agitation.
939987 [4837] 
939987 [4838] â€œI am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shanâ€™t
939987 [4839] spare myself. My first idea was aâ€”Karamazov one. Once I was bitten by a
939987 [4840] centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, I
939987 [4841] felt a centipede biting at my heart thenâ€”a noxious insect, you understand?
939987 [4842] I looked her up and down. Youâ€™ve seen her? Sheâ€™s a beauty. But she was
939987 [4843] beautiful in another way then. At that moment she was beautiful because
939987 [4844] she was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her
939987 [4845] generosity and sacrifice for her father, and Iâ€”a bug! And, scoundrel as I
939987 [4846] was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. I
939987 [4847] tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed my
939987 [4848] heart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if there could be
939987 [4849] no resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomous
939987 [4850] spider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I
939987 [4851] should have gone next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end
939987 [4852] honorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though
939987 [4853] Iâ€™m a man of base desires, Iâ€™m honest. And at that very second some voice
939987 [4854] seemed to whisper in my ear, â€˜But when you come to-morrow to make your
939987 [4855] proposal, that girl wonâ€™t even see you; sheâ€™ll order her coachman to kick
939987 [4856] you out of the yard. â€œPublish it through all the town,â€ she would say,
939987 [4857] â€œIâ€™m not afraid of you.â€ â€™ I looked at the young lady, my voice had not
939987 [4858] deceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from
939987 [4859] her face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite was
939987 [4860] roused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cadâ€™s trick: to look at
939987 [4861] her with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her
939987 [4862] with a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.
939987 [4863] 
939987 [4864] â€œ â€˜Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. Youâ€™ve been counting
939987 [4865] your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my
939987 [4866] heart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity.
939987 [4867] Youâ€™ve put yourself out to no purpose.â€™
939987 [4868] 
939987 [4869] â€œI should have lost the game, of course. Sheâ€™d have run away. But it would
939987 [4870] have been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all. Iâ€™d have
939987 [4871] howled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played that
939987 [4872] trick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any other
939987 [4873] woman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with hatred. But, on my
939987 [4874] oath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful
939987 [4875] hatredâ€”that hate which is only a hairâ€™s-breadth from love, from the
939987 [4876] maddest love!
939987 [4877] 
939987 [4878] â€œI went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I
939987 [4879] remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long,
939987 [4880] donâ€™t be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the drawer
939987 [4881] and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying in a
939987 [4882] French dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it, handed it
939987 [4883] to her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her a
939987 [4884] deep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! She
939987 [4885] shuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly paleâ€”white
939987 [4886] as a sheet, in factâ€”and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently,
939987 [4887] bowed down to my feetâ€”not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow,
939987 [4888] with her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
939987 [4889] my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I
939987 [4890] donâ€™t know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it
939987 [4891] was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from
939987 [4892] delight? But I didnâ€™t stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back
939987 [4893] in the scabbardâ€”which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And
939987 [4894] I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on
939987 [4895] rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who
939987 [4896] pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that â€˜adventureâ€™ with Katerina
939987 [4897] Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and youâ€”no one else.â€
939987 [4898] 
939987 [4899] Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his
939987 [4900] handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the same
939987 [4901] place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn
939987 [4902] quite round to face him.

939987 [4905]

939987 [4907] 
939987 [4908] 
939987 [4909] â€œNow,â€ said Alyosha, â€œI understand the first half.â€
939987 [4910] 
939987 [4911] â€œYou understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was played
939987 [4912] out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.â€
939987 [4913] 
939987 [4914] â€œAnd I understand nothing of that second half so far,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [4915] 
939987 [4916] â€œAnd I? Do you suppose I understand it?â€
939987 [4917] 
939987 [4918] â€œStop, Dmitri. Thereâ€™s one important question. Tell me, you were
939987 [4919] betrothed, you are betrothed still?â€
939987 [4920] 
939987 [4921] â€œWe werenâ€™t betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure.
939987 [4922] The next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, that
939987 [4923] there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer. On
939987 [4924] her side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained in
939987 [4925] the town; except, indeed, for one action. The day after her visit the
939987 [4926] maid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it
939987 [4927] open: it contained the change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five
939987 [4928] hundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred
939987 [4929] on changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I donâ€™t
939987 [4930] remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searched
939987 [4931] the packet for a pencil markâ€”n-nothing! Well, I spent the rest of the
939987 [4932] money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.
939987 [4933] 
939987 [4934] â€œWell, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to the
939987 [4935] astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the money
939987 [4936] untouched. Heâ€™d no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed, and,
939987 [4937] three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five days
939987 [4938] afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had time to
939987 [4939] receive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with
939987 [4940] her aunt and sister, went to Moscow. And, behold, on the very day they
939987 [4941] went away (I hadnâ€™t seen them, didnâ€™t see them off or take leave) I
939987 [4942] received a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line
939987 [4943] in pencil: â€˜I will write to you. Wait. K.â€™ And that was all.
939987 [4944] 
939987 [4945] â€œIâ€™ll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changed
939987 [4946] with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabian
939987 [4947] fairy-tale. That generalâ€™s widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lost
939987 [4948] the two nieces who were her heiresses and next-of-kinâ€”both died in the
939987 [4949] same week of small-pox. The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed
939987 [4950] Katya as a daughter, as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in
939987 [4951] Katyaâ€™s favor. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for
939987 [4952] present use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what
939987 [4953] she liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
939987 [4954] Moscow, later.
939987 [4955] 
939987 [4956] â€œWell, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles. I
939987 [4957] was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later came
939987 [4958] the promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She offers
939987 [4959] to be my wife, offers herself to me. â€˜I love you madly,â€™ she says, â€˜even
939987 [4960] if you donâ€™t love me, never mind. Be my husband. Donâ€™t be afraid. I wonâ€™t
939987 [4961] hamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under
939987 [4962] your feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.â€™
939987 [4963] Alyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
939987 [4964] my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myself
939987 [4965] of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I donâ€™t mindâ€”that I donâ€™t
939987 [4966] mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it was impossible for me to
939987 [4967] go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears. One thing I shall be ashamed of
939987 [4968] for ever. I referred to her being rich and having a dowry while I was only
939987 [4969] a stuck-up beggar! I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence,
939987 [4970] but it slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all
939987 [4971] I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do you
939987 [4972] look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with
939987 [4973] her; heâ€™s in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, in
939987 [4974] the worldâ€™s opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving
939987 [4975] of us all now. Oo! Donâ€™t you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she
939987 [4976] respects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like
939987 [4977] me, especially after all that has happened here?â€
939987 [4978] 
939987 [4979] â€œBut I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man like
939987 [4980] him.â€
939987 [4981] 
939987 [4982] â€œShe loves her own _virtue_, not me.â€ The words broke involuntarily, and
939987 [4983] almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his eyes
939987 [4984] gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist.
939987 [4985] 
939987 [4986] â€œI swear, Alyosha,â€ he cried, with intense and genuine anger at himself;
939987 [4987] â€œyou may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is God, I swear
939987 [4988] that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I know that I am a
939987 [4989] million times baser in soul than she, and that these lofty sentiments of
939987 [4990] hers are as sincere as a heavenly angelâ€™s. Thatâ€™s the tragedy of itâ€”that I
939987 [4991] know that for certain. What if any one does show off a bit? Donâ€™t I do it
939987 [4992] myself? And yet Iâ€™m sincere, Iâ€™m sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand
939987 [4993] how he must be cursing nature nowâ€”with his intellect, too! To see the
939987 [4994] preference givenâ€”to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he is
939987 [4995] betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, canâ€™t restrain his
939987 [4996] debaucheriesâ€”and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man like me
939987 [4997] is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl wants to
939987 [4998] sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. Itâ€™s ridiculous! Iâ€™ve
939987 [4999] never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped a
939987 [5000] hint of the sort to me. But destiny will be accomplished, and the best man
939987 [5001] will hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his
939987 [5002] back-alley for everâ€”his filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where
939987 [5003] he is at home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free
939987 [5004] will and with enjoyment. Iâ€™ve been talking foolishly. Iâ€™ve no words left.
939987 [5005] I use them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
939987 [5006] back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.â€
939987 [5007] 
939987 [5008] â€œStop, Dmitri,â€ Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. â€œThereâ€™s one
939987 [5009] thing you havenâ€™t made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same,
939987 [5010] arenâ€™t you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your betrothed,
939987 [5011] doesnâ€™t want to?â€
939987 [5012] 
939987 [5013] â€œYes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in
939987 [5014] Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The generalâ€™s
939987 [5015] wife blessed us, andâ€”would you believe it?â€”congratulated Katya. â€˜Youâ€™ve
939987 [5016] made a good choice,â€™ she said, â€˜I see right through him.â€™ Andâ€”would you
939987 [5017] believe it?â€”she didnâ€™t like Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of
939987 [5018] talk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about myselfâ€”sincerely, honorably.
939987 [5019] She listened to everything.
939987 [5020] 
939987 [5021] 
939987 [5022]     There was sweet confusion,
939987 [5023]     There were tender words.
939987 [5024] 
939987 [5025] 
939987 [5026] Though there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty promise
939987 [5027] to reform. I gave my promise, and hereâ€”â€
939987 [5028] 
939987 [5029] â€œWhat?â€
939987 [5030] 
939987 [5031] â€œWhy, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very
939987 [5032] dayâ€”remember itâ€”to send youâ€”this very day againâ€”to Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [5033] andâ€”â€
939987 [5034] 
939987 [5035] â€œWhat?â€
939987 [5036] 
939987 [5037] â€œTo tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, â€˜He sends you
939987 [5038] his compliments.â€™ â€
939987 [5039] 
939987 [5040] â€œBut is that possible?â€
939987 [5041] 
939987 [5042] â€œThatâ€™s just the reason Iâ€™m sending you, in my place, because itâ€™s
939987 [5043] impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?â€
939987 [5044] 
939987 [5045] â€œAnd where are you going?â€
939987 [5046] 
939987 [5047] â€œTo the back-alley.â€
939987 [5048] 
939987 [5049] â€œTo Grushenka, then!â€ Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.
939987 [5050] â€œCan Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had just
939987 [5051] visited her, and that was all.â€
939987 [5052] 
939987 [5053] â€œCan a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and with
939987 [5054] such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, I
939987 [5055] have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be
939987 [5056] betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look at
939987 [5057] me? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and I
939987 [5058] know for a fact now, that that captain, fatherâ€™s agent, had given
939987 [5059] Grushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an
939987 [5060] end to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a
939987 [5061] glimpse of her before. She doesnâ€™t strike one at first sight. I knew about
939987 [5062] her old merchant, whoâ€™s lying ill now, paralyzed; but heâ€™s leaving her a
939987 [5063] decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that she
939987 [5064] hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that sheâ€™s a
939987 [5065] merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I stayed. The storm
939987 [5066] brokeâ€”it struck me down like the plague. Iâ€™m plague-stricken still, and I
939987 [5067] know that everything is over, that there will never be anything more for
939987 [5068] me. The cycle of the ages is accomplished. Thatâ€™s my position. And though
939987 [5069] Iâ€™m a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my
939987 [5070] pocket. I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from
939987 [5071] here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there
939987 [5072] drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. In
939987 [5073] three daysâ€™ time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the hero
939987 [5074] had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue,
939987 [5075] Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in her
939987 [5076] little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that was
939987 [5077] all, I swear! â€˜Iâ€™ll marry you if you like,â€™ she said, â€˜youâ€™re a beggar,
939987 [5078] you know. Say that you wonâ€™t beat me, and will let me do anything I
939987 [5079] choose, and perhaps I will marry you.â€™ She laughed, and sheâ€™s laughing
939987 [5080] still!â€
939987 [5081] 
939987 [5082] Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though he
939987 [5083] were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
939987 [5084] 
939987 [5085] â€œAnd do you really mean to marry her?â€
939987 [5086] 
939987 [5087] â€œAt once, if she will. And if she wonâ€™t, I shall stay all the same. Iâ€™ll
939987 [5088] be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!â€ he cried. He stopped short before
939987 [5089] him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently. â€œDo you
939987 [5090] know, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium, senseless delirium, for
939987 [5091] thereâ€™s a tragedy here. Let me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man,
939987 [5092] with low and degraded passions, but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri
939987 [5093] Karamazov never can be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and
939987 [5094] a pickpocket. That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka,
939987 [5095] Katerina Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I donâ€™t know, I
939987 [5096] suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of the
939987 [5097] province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow,
939987 [5098] so that nothing should be known of it in the town here. So I had that
939987 [5099] three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it
939987 [5100] was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been to
939987 [5101] the town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sent
939987 [5102] the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I havenâ€™t brought it.
939987 [5103] Iâ€™ve forgotten it. Now what do you think youâ€™re going to her to-day to
939987 [5104] say? â€˜He sends his compliments,â€™ and sheâ€™ll ask you, â€˜What about the
939987 [5105] money?â€™ You might still have said to her, â€˜Heâ€™s a degraded sensualist, and
939987 [5106] a low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didnâ€™t send your money
939987 [5107] then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldnâ€™t control
939987 [5108] himself.â€™ But still you might have added, â€˜He isnâ€™t a thief though. Here
939987 [5109] is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya
939987 [5110] Ivanovna. But he told me to say â€œhe sends his compliments.â€ â€™ But, as it
939987 [5111] is, she will ask, â€˜But where is the money?â€™ â€
939987 [5112] 
939987 [5113] â€œMitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Donâ€™t worry
939987 [5114] yourself to death with despair.â€
939987 [5115] 
939987 [5116] â€œWhat, do you suppose Iâ€™d shoot myself because I canâ€™t get three thousand
939987 [5117] to pay back? Thatâ€™s just it. I shanâ€™t shoot myself. I havenâ€™t the strength
939987 [5118] now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now Iâ€™m going to Grushenka. I donâ€™t care
939987 [5119] what happens.â€
939987 [5120] 
939987 [5121] â€œAnd what then?â€
939987 [5122] 
939987 [5123] â€œIâ€™ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, Iâ€™ll
939987 [5124] go into the next room. Iâ€™ll clean her friendsâ€™ goloshes, blow up their
939987 [5125] samovar, run their errands.â€
939987 [5126] 
939987 [5127] â€œKaterina Ivanovna will understand it all,â€ Alyosha said solemnly. â€œSheâ€™ll
939987 [5128] understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty
939987 [5129] mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. Sheâ€™ll see that for
939987 [5130] herself.â€
939987 [5131] 
939987 [5132] â€œShe wonâ€™t forgive everything,â€ said Dmitri, with a grin. â€œThereâ€™s
939987 [5133] something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what
939987 [5134] would be the best thing to do?â€
939987 [5135] 
939987 [5136] â€œWhat?â€
939987 [5137] 
939987 [5138] â€œPay back the three thousand.â€
939987 [5139] 
939987 [5140] â€œWhere can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give you
939987 [5141] another thousandâ€”that makes three. Take it and pay it back.â€
939987 [5142] 
939987 [5143] â€œAnd when would you get it, your three thousand? Youâ€™re not of age,
939987 [5144] besides, and you mustâ€”you absolutely mustâ€”take my farewell to her to-day,
939987 [5145] with the money or without it, for I canâ€™t drag on any longer, things have
939987 [5146] come to such a pass. To-morrow is too late. I shall send you to father.â€
939987 [5147] 
939987 [5148] â€œTo father?â€
939987 [5149] 
939987 [5150] â€œYes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.â€
939987 [5151] 
939987 [5152] â€œBut, Mitya, he wonâ€™t give it.â€
939987 [5153] 
939987 [5154] â€œAs though he would! I know he wonâ€™t. Do you know the meaning of despair,
939987 [5155] Alexey?â€
939987 [5156] 
939987 [5157] â€œYes.â€
939987 [5158] 
939987 [5159] â€œListen. Legally he owes me nothing. Iâ€™ve had it all from him, I know
939987 [5160] that. But morally he owes me something, doesnâ€™t he? You know he started
939987 [5161] with twenty-eight thousand of my motherâ€™s money and made a hundred
939987 [5162] thousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eight
939987 [5163] thousand, and heâ€™ll draw my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many
939987 [5164] of his sins. For that three thousandâ€”I give you my solemn wordâ€”Iâ€™ll make
939987 [5165] an end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the last
939987 [5166] time I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God Himself sends him
939987 [5167] this chance.â€
939987 [5168] 
939987 [5169] â€œMitya, he wonâ€™t give it for anything.â€
939987 [5170] 
939987 [5171] â€œI know he wonâ€™t. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. Thatâ€™s not
939987 [5172] all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps only
939987 [5173] yesterday he found out for the first time _in earnest_ (underline _in
939987 [5174] earnest_) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means to
939987 [5175] marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose heâ€™s
939987 [5176] going to give me money to help to bring that about when heâ€™s crazy about
939987 [5177] her himself? And thatâ€™s not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I
939987 [5178] know that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of
939987 [5179] the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large
939987 [5180] envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see
939987 [5181] how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: â€˜To my angel,
939987 [5182] Grushenka, when she will come to me.â€™ He scrawled it himself in silence
939987 [5183] and in secret, and no one knows that the moneyâ€™s there except the valet,
939987 [5184] Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now he has been expecting
939987 [5185] Grushenka for the last three or four days; he hopes sheâ€™ll come for the
939987 [5186] money. He has sent her word of it, and she has sent him word that perhaps
939987 [5187] sheâ€™ll come. And if she does go to the old man, can I marry her after
939987 [5188] that? You understand now why Iâ€™m here in secret and what Iâ€™m on the watch
939987 [5189] for.â€
939987 [5190] 
939987 [5191] â€œFor her?â€
939987 [5192] 
939987 [5193] â€œYes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Foma
939987 [5194] comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He does jobs for
939987 [5195] them. Heâ€™s watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time; and
939987 [5196] thatâ€™s how he lives. Iâ€™ve established myself in his room. Neither he nor
939987 [5197] the women of the house know the secretâ€”that is, that I am on the watch
939987 [5198] here.â€
939987 [5199] 
939987 [5200] â€œNo one but Smerdyakov knows, then?â€
939987 [5201] 
939987 [5202] â€œNo one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.â€
939987 [5203] 
939987 [5204] â€œIt was he told you about the money, then?â€
939987 [5205] 
939987 [5206] â€œYes. Itâ€™s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesnâ€™t know about the money, or
939987 [5207] anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three
939987 [5208] daysâ€™ journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: heâ€™ll give eight
939987 [5209] thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him by
939987 [5210] going to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. Thatâ€™s what the
939987 [5211] old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while heâ€™s away.â€
939987 [5212] 
939987 [5213] â€œThen heâ€™s expecting Grushenka to-day?â€
939987 [5214] 
939987 [5215] â€œNo, she wonâ€™t come to-day; there are signs. Sheâ€™s certain not to come,â€
939987 [5216] cried Mitya suddenly. â€œSmerdyakov thinks so, too. Fatherâ€™s drinking now.
939987 [5217] Heâ€™s sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three
939987 [5218] thousand.â€
939987 [5219] 
939987 [5220] â€œMitya, dear, whatâ€™s the matter with you?â€ cried Alyosha, jumping up from
939987 [5221] his place, and looking keenly at his brotherâ€™s frenzied face. For one
939987 [5222] moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.
939987 [5223] 
939987 [5224] â€œWhat is it? Iâ€™m not insane,â€ said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestly
939987 [5225] at him. â€œNo fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what Iâ€™m saying.
939987 [5226] I believe in miracles.â€
939987 [5227] 
939987 [5228] â€œIn miracles?â€
939987 [5229] 
939987 [5230] â€œIn a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my
939987 [5231] despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He wonâ€™t let something awful
939987 [5232] happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!â€
939987 [5233] 
939987 [5234] â€œI am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?â€
939987 [5235] 
939987 [5236] â€œYes. I know it will take some time. You canâ€™t go at him point blank. Heâ€™s
939987 [5237] drunk now. Iâ€™ll wait three hoursâ€”four, five, six, seven. Only remember you
939987 [5238] must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if it has to be at midnight, _with
939987 [5239] the money or without the money_, and say, â€˜He sends his compliments to
939987 [5240] you.â€™ I want you to say that verse to her: â€˜He sends his compliments to
939987 [5241] you.â€™ â€
939987 [5242] 
939987 [5243] â€œMitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-dayâ€”if not to-day, to-morrow, or
939987 [5244] the next day?â€
939987 [5245] 
939987 [5246] â€œGrushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.â€
939987 [5247] 
939987 [5248] â€œAnd ifâ€”â€
939987 [5249] 
939987 [5250] â€œIf thereâ€™s an if, it will be murder. I couldnâ€™t endure it.â€
939987 [5251] 
939987 [5252] â€œWho will be murdered?â€
939987 [5253] 
939987 [5254] â€œThe old man. I shanâ€™t kill her.â€
939987 [5255] 
939987 [5256] â€œBrother, what are you saying?â€
939987 [5257] 
939987 [5258] â€œOh, I donâ€™t know.... I donâ€™t know. Perhaps I shanâ€™t kill, and perhaps I
939987 [5259] shall. Iâ€™m afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his
939987 [5260] face at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his eyes, his
939987 [5261] shameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m afraid of.
939987 [5262] Thatâ€™s what may be too much for me.â€
939987 [5263] 
939987 [5264] â€œIâ€™ll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best, that
939987 [5265] nothing awful may happen.â€
939987 [5266] 
939987 [5267] â€œAnd I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesnâ€™t come to passâ€”â€
939987 [5268] 
939987 [5269] Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his fatherâ€™s house.
939987 [5270] 
939987 [5271] 
939987 [5272] 
939987 [5273] Chapter VI. Smerdyakov
939987 [5274] 
939987 [5275] 
939987 [5276] He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a
939987 [5277] dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room,
939987 [5278] which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation.
939987 [5279] The furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky
939987 [5280] material. In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in
939987 [5281] elaborate white and gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. On the walls,
939987 [5282] covered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two
939987 [5283] large portraitsâ€”one of some prince who had been governor of the district
939987 [5284] thirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead.
939987 [5285] In the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a
939987 [5286] lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as
939987 [5287] to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three
939987 [5288] or four oâ€™clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night
939987 [5289] or sit in an arm-chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He
939987 [5290] often slept quite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge;
939987 [5291] but usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
939987 [5292] 
939987 [5293] When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been
939987 [5294] served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.
939987 [5295] Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory and
939987 [5296] Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemed
939987 [5297] in singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter.
939987 [5298] Before he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so
939987 [5299] well, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached
939987 [5300] the good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
939987 [5301] 
939987 [5302] â€œHere he is! Here he is!â€ yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at
939987 [5303] seeing Alyosha. â€œJoin us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but itâ€™s hot
939987 [5304] and good. I donâ€™t offer you brandy, youâ€™re keeping the fast. But would you
939987 [5305] like some? No; Iâ€™d better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov,
939987 [5306] go to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look
939987 [5307] sharp!â€
939987 [5308] 
939987 [5309] Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
939987 [5310] 
939987 [5311] â€œNever mind. If you wonâ€™t have it, we will,â€ said Fyodor Pavlovitch,
939987 [5312] beaming. â€œBut stayâ€”have you dined?â€
939987 [5313] 
939987 [5314] â€œYes,â€ answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and
939987 [5315] drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superiorâ€™s kitchen. â€œThough I should
939987 [5316] be pleased to have some hot coffee.â€
939987 [5317] 
939987 [5318] â€œBravo, my darling! Heâ€™ll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No, itâ€™s
939987 [5319] boiling. Itâ€™s capital coffee: Smerdyakovâ€™s making. My Smerdyakovâ€™s an
939987 [5320] artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You must come
939987 [5321] one day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay;
939987 [5322] didnâ€™t I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow
939987 [5323] and all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!â€
939987 [5324] 
939987 [5325] â€œNo, I havenâ€™t,â€ said Alyosha, smiling, too.
939987 [5326] 
939987 [5327] â€œAh, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, werenâ€™t
939987 [5328] you? There, my darling, I couldnâ€™t do anything to vex you. Do you know,
939987 [5329] Ivan, I canâ€™t resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs?
939987 [5330] It makes me laugh all over. Iâ€™m so fond of him. Alyosha, let me give you
939987 [5331] my blessingâ€”a fatherâ€™s blessing.â€
939987 [5332] 
939987 [5333] Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.
939987 [5334] 
939987 [5335] â€œNo, no,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll just make the sign of the cross over you, for
939987 [5336] now. Sit still. Now weâ€™ve a treat for you, in your own line, too. Itâ€™ll
939987 [5337] make you laugh. Balaamâ€™s ass has begun talking to us hereâ€”and how he
939987 [5338] talks! How he talks!â€
939987 [5339] 
939987 [5340] Balaamâ€™s ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young man
939987 [5341] of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not that he
939987 [5342] was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to
939987 [5343] despise everybody.
939987 [5344] 
939987 [5345] But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up by
939987 [5346] Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up â€œwith no sense of gratitude,â€ as
939987 [5347] Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the
939987 [5348] world mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats,
939987 [5349] and burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as
939987 [5350] though it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead
939987 [5351] cat as though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the
939987 [5352] greatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a
939987 [5353] sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week. â€œHe
939987 [5354] doesnâ€™t care for you or me, the monster,â€ Grigory used to say to Marfa,
939987 [5355] â€œand he doesnâ€™t care for any one. Are you a human being?â€ he said,
939987 [5356] addressing the boy directly. â€œYouâ€™re not a human being. You grew from the
939987 [5357] mildew in the bath-house.(2) Thatâ€™s what you are.â€ Smerdyakov, it appeared
939987 [5358] afterwards, could never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to
939987 [5359] read and write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the
939987 [5360] Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third
939987 [5361] lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
939987 [5362] 
939987 [5363] â€œWhatâ€™s that for?â€ asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from under
939987 [5364] his spectacles.
939987 [5365] 
939987 [5366] â€œOh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, and
939987 [5367] stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?â€
939987 [5368] 
939987 [5369] Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.
939987 [5370] There was something positively condescending in his expression. Grigory
939987 [5371] could not restrain himself. â€œIâ€™ll show you where!â€ he cried, and gave the
939987 [5372] boy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, but
939987 [5373] withdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he had his
939987 [5374] first attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of his
939987 [5375] lifeâ€”epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy
939987 [5376] seemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he
939987 [5377] never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him.
939987 [5378] Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy something
939987 [5379] sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed an
939987 [5380] active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the
939987 [5381] disease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, once
939987 [5382] a month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some
939987 [5383] were light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade
939987 [5384] Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to
939987 [5385] come upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a
939987 [5386] time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [5387] noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the
939987 [5388] glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of booksâ€”over a hundredâ€”but no
939987 [5389] one ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the
939987 [5390] bookcase. â€œCome, read. You shall be my librarian. Youâ€™ll be better sitting
939987 [5391] reading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,â€ and Fyodor
939987 [5392] Pavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_.
939987 [5393] 
939987 [5394] He read a little but didnâ€™t like it. He did not once smile, and ended by
939987 [5395] frowning.
939987 [5396] 
939987 [5397] â€œWhy? Isnâ€™t it funny?â€ asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
939987 [5398] 
939987 [5399] Smerdyakov did not speak.
939987 [5400] 
939987 [5401] â€œAnswer, stupid!â€
939987 [5402] 
939987 [5403] â€œItâ€™s all untrue,â€ mumbled the boy, with a grin.
939987 [5404] 
939987 [5405] â€œThen go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, hereâ€™s
939987 [5406] Smaragdovâ€™s _Universal History_. Thatâ€™s all true. Read that.â€
939987 [5407] 
939987 [5408] But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought it
939987 [5409] dull. So the bookcase was closed again.
939987 [5410] 
939987 [5411] Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that
939987 [5412] Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary
939987 [5413] fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his spoon and look
939987 [5414] into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it to
939987 [5415] the light.
939987 [5416] 
939987 [5417] â€œWhat is it? A beetle?â€ Grigory would ask.
939987 [5418] 
939987 [5419] â€œA fly, perhaps,â€ observed Marfa.
939987 [5420] 
939987 [5421] The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread,
939987 [5422] his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to the
939987 [5423] light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberation
939987 [5424] decide to put it in his mouth.
939987 [5425] 
939987 [5426] â€œAch! What fine gentlemenâ€™s airs!â€ Grigory muttered, looking at him.
939987 [5427] 
939987 [5428] When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he
939987 [5429] determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained. He
939987 [5430] spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance. He
939987 [5431] looked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had grown wrinkled,
939987 [5432] yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he seemed almost exactly
939987 [5433] the same as before he went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not
939987 [5434] the slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we
939987 [5435] heard afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little
939987 [5436] interest for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice
939987 [5437] of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and
939987 [5438] displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow well
939987 [5439] dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes most
939987 [5440] scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning his
939987 [5441] smart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone like
939987 [5442] mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a
939987 [5443] salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade,
939987 [5444] perfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the
939987 [5445] female sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them.
939987 [5446] Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were
939987 [5447] becoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did
939987 [5448] not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
939987 [5449] 
939987 [5450] â€œWhy are your fits getting worse?â€ asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking
939987 [5451] askance at his new cook. â€œWould you like to get married? Shall I find you
939987 [5452] a wife?â€
939987 [5453] 
939987 [5454] But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor
939987 [5455] Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that he
939987 [5456] had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when Fyodor
939987 [5457] Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three
939987 [5458] hundred-rouble notes which he had only just received. He only missed them
939987 [5459] next day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the
939987 [5460] notes lying on the table. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked
939987 [5461] them up and brought them in the day before.
939987 [5462] 
939987 [5463] â€œWell, my lad, Iâ€™ve never met any one like you,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch said
939987 [5464] shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed in
939987 [5465] his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although the
939987 [5466] young man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent.
939987 [5467] He rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what
939987 [5468] the young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have
939987 [5469] been impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop
939987 [5470] suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand
939987 [5471] still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his face
939987 [5472] would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only a
939987 [5473] sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by the painter
939987 [5474] Kramskoy, called â€œContemplation.â€ There is a forest in winter, and on a
939987 [5475] roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a
939987 [5476] torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he
939987 [5477] is not thinking; he is â€œcontemplating.â€ If any one touched him he would
939987 [5478] start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. Itâ€™s true he
939987 [5479] would come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been
939987 [5480] thinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden
939987 [5481] within himself, the impression which had dominated him during the period
939987 [5482] of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards
939987 [5483] them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he
939987 [5484] does not know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many
939987 [5485] years, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his
939987 [5486] soulâ€™s salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native
939987 [5487] village, and perhaps do both. There are a good many â€œcontemplativesâ€ among
939987 [5488] the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he probably
939987 [5489] was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing why.

939987 [5491] 
939987 [5492] 
939987 [5493] Chapter VII. The Controversy
939987 [5494] 
939987 [5495] 
939987 [5496] But Balaamâ€™s ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one.
939987 [5497] Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from the
939987 [5498] shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared in
939987 [5499] the newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken prisoner in some
939987 [5500] remote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death
939987 [5501] if he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny
939987 [5502] his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and
939987 [5503] glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor
939987 [5504] Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk,
939987 [5505] if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humored
939987 [5506] and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening to the story, he
939987 [5507] observed that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and to
939987 [5508] take his skin to some monastery. â€œThat would make the people flock, and
939987 [5509] bring the money in.â€
939987 [5510] 
939987 [5511] Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched,
939987 [5512] but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who was
939987 [5513] standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table towards the
939987 [5514] end of dinner, and since Ivanâ€™s arrival in our town he had done so every
939987 [5515] day.
939987 [5516] 
939987 [5517] â€œWhat are you grinning at?â€ asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile
939987 [5518] instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.
939987 [5519] 
939987 [5520] â€œWell, my opinion is,â€ Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a
939987 [5521] loud voice, â€œthat if that laudable soldierâ€™s exploit was so very great
939987 [5522] there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such an
939987 [5523] emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his own
939987 [5524] christening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which, in
939987 [5525] the course of years to expiate his cowardice.â€
939987 [5526] 
939987 [5527] â€œHow could it not be a sin? Youâ€™re talking nonsense. For that youâ€™ll go
939987 [5528] straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,â€ put in Fyodor
939987 [5529] Pavlovitch.
939987 [5530] 
939987 [5531] It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we
939987 [5532] have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.
939987 [5533] 
939987 [5534] â€œWeâ€™re on your subject, your subject,â€ he chuckled gleefully, making
939987 [5535] Alyosha sit down to listen.
939987 [5536] 
939987 [5537] â€œAs for mutton, thatâ€™s not so, and thereâ€™ll be nothing there for this, and
939987 [5538] there shouldnâ€™t be either, if itâ€™s according to justice,â€ Smerdyakov
939987 [5539] maintained stoutly.
939987 [5540] 
939987 [5541] â€œHow do you mean â€˜according to justiceâ€™?â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still
939987 [5542] more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.
939987 [5543] 
939987 [5544] â€œHeâ€™s a rascal, thatâ€™s what he is!â€ burst from Grigory. He looked
939987 [5545] Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
939987 [5546] 
939987 [5547] â€œAs for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,â€ answered
939987 [5548] Smerdyakov with perfect composure. â€œYouâ€™d better consider yourself that,
939987 [5549] once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they
939987 [5550] demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy
939987 [5551] christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there
939987 [5552] would be no sin in it.â€
939987 [5553] 
939987 [5554] â€œBut youâ€™ve said that before. Donâ€™t waste words. Prove it,â€ cried Fyodor
939987 [5555] Pavlovitch.
939987 [5556] 
939987 [5557] â€œSoup-maker!â€ muttered Grigory contemptuously.
939987 [5558] 
939987 [5559] â€œAs for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself,
939987 [5560] Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those
939987 [5561] enemies, â€˜No, Iâ€™m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,â€™ then at once,
939987 [5562] by Godâ€™s high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema
939987 [5563] accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a
939987 [5564] heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but
939987 [5565] when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am
939987 [5566] cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?â€
939987 [5567] 
939987 [5568] He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really
939987 [5569] answering Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s questions, and was well aware of it, and
939987 [5570] intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.
939987 [5571] 
939987 [5572] â€œIvan,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, â€œstoop down for me to whisper.
939987 [5573] Heâ€™s got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise him. Praise
939987 [5574] him.â€
939987 [5575] 
939987 [5576] Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his fatherâ€™s excited whisper.
939987 [5577] 
939987 [5578] â€œStay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more.
939987 [5579] â€œIvan, your ear again.â€
939987 [5580] 
939987 [5581] Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.
939987 [5582] 
939987 [5583] â€œI love you as I do Alyosha. Donâ€™t think I donâ€™t love you. Some brandy?â€
939987 [5584] 
939987 [5585] â€œYes.â€”But youâ€™re rather drunk yourself,â€ thought Ivan, looking steadily at
939987 [5586] his father.
939987 [5587] 
939987 [5588] He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
939987 [5589] 
939987 [5590] â€œYouâ€™re anathema accursed, as it is,â€ Grigory suddenly burst out, â€œand how
939987 [5591] dare you argue, you rascal, after that, ifâ€”â€
939987 [5592] 
939987 [5593] â€œDonâ€™t scold him, Grigory, donâ€™t scold him,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him
939987 [5594] short.
939987 [5595] 
939987 [5596] â€œYou should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen,
939987 [5597] for I havenâ€™t finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I become
939987 [5598] accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen,
939987 [5599] and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isnâ€™t that
939987 [5600] so?â€
939987 [5601] 
939987 [5602] â€œMake haste and finish, my boy,â€ Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping from
939987 [5603] his wine-glass with relish.
939987 [5604] 
939987 [5605] â€œAnd if Iâ€™ve ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy
939987 [5606] when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I had
939987 [5607] already been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of the
939987 [5608] thought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy. And if I
939987 [5609] have already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justice
939987 [5610] can I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for having
939987 [5611] denied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him I
939987 [5612] had been relieved from my christening? If Iâ€™m no longer a Christian, then
939987 [5613] I canâ€™t renounce Christ, for Iâ€™ve nothing then to renounce. Who will hold
939987 [5614] an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for
939987 [5615] not having been born a Christian? And who would punish him for that,
939987 [5616] considering that you canâ€™t take two skins off one ox? For God Almighty
939987 [5617] Himself, even if He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies would
939987 [5618] give him the smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must be
939987 [5619] punished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the world
939987 [5620] an unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God canâ€™t surely take a
939987 [5621] Tatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty would
939987 [5622] tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even
939987 [5623] in one word?â€
939987 [5624] 
939987 [5625] Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearly
939987 [5626] starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what was
939987 [5627] said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a
939987 [5628] man who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied
939987 [5629] his glass and went off into his shrill laugh.
939987 [5630] 
939987 [5631] â€œAlyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must have
939987 [5632] been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who
939987 [5633] taught you? But youâ€™re talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense,
939987 [5634] nonsense. Donâ€™t cry, Grigory, weâ€™ll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a
939987 [5635] moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you
939987 [5636] have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say
939987 [5637] yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once
939987 [5638] youâ€™re anathema they wonâ€™t pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you
939987 [5639] say to that, my fine Jesuit?â€
939987 [5640] 
939987 [5641] â€œThere is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was
939987 [5642] no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.â€
939987 [5643] 
939987 [5644] â€œHowâ€™s that the most ordinary?â€
939987 [5645] 
939987 [5646] â€œYou lie, accursed one!â€ hissed Grigory.
939987 [5647] 
939987 [5648] â€œConsider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,â€ Smerdyakov went on, staid and
939987 [5649] unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to the
939987 [5650] vanquished foe. â€œConsider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in
939987 [5651] the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a
939987 [5652] mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your
939987 [5653] bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if Iâ€™m without faith and you have so
939987 [5654] great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself
939987 [5655] telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for thatâ€™s a long way off,
939987 [5656] but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the
939987 [5657] garden. Youâ€™ll see for yourself that it wonâ€™t budge, but will remain just
939987 [5658] where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory
939987 [5659] Vassilyevitch, that you havenâ€™t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse
939987 [5660] others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day,
939987 [5661] not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest
939987 [5662] peasant, can shove mountains into the seaâ€”except perhaps some one man in
939987 [5663] the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls
939987 [5664] in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldnâ€™t find themâ€”if
939987 [5665] so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that
939987 [5666] is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the
939987 [5667] desert, and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And
939987 [5668] so Iâ€™m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven
939987 [5669] if I shed tears of repentance.â€
939987 [5670] 
939987 [5671] â€œStay!â€ cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. â€œSo you do
939987 [5672] suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it,
939987 [5673] write it down. There you have the Russian all over!â€
939987 [5674] 
939987 [5675] â€œYouâ€™re quite right in saying itâ€™s characteristic of the peopleâ€™s faith,â€
939987 [5676] Ivan assented, with an approving smile.
939987 [5677] 
939987 [5678] â€œYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. Itâ€™s true, isnâ€™t it,
939987 [5679] Alyosha? Thatâ€™s the Russian faith all over, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [5680] 
939987 [5681] â€œNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,â€ said Alyosha firmly and
939987 [5682] gravely.
939987 [5683] 
939987 [5684] â€œIâ€™m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only
939987 [5685] that idea. Surely thatâ€™s Russian, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [5686] 
939987 [5687] â€œYes, thatâ€™s purely Russian,â€ said Alyosha smiling.
939987 [5688] 
939987 [5689] â€œYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and Iâ€™ll give it to you to-day.
939987 [5690] But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you,
939987 [5691] stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness,
939987 [5692] because we havenâ€™t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second
939987 [5693] place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours in
939987 [5694] the day, so that one hasnâ€™t even time to get sleep enough, much less to
939987 [5695] repent of oneâ€™s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies
939987 [5696] when youâ€™d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I
939987 [5697] consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.â€
939987 [5698] 
939987 [5699] â€œConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
939987 [5700] that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then
939987 [5701] in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been
939987 [5702] sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the
939987 [5703] pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldnâ€™t have come to torture
939987 [5704] then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the
939987 [5705] mountain, â€˜Move and crush the tormentor,â€™ and it would have moved and at
939987 [5706] the very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have
939987 [5707] walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.
939987 [5708] But, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that
939987 [5709] mountain, â€˜Crush these tormentors,â€™ and it hadnâ€™t crushed them, how could
939987 [5710] I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of
939987 [5711] mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not
939987 [5712] attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain
939987 [5713] had not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up
939987 [5714] aloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to
939987 [5715] come). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no
939987 [5716] good purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back,
939987 [5717] even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry. And
939987 [5718] at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose
939987 [5719] oneâ€™s reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all.
939987 [5720] And, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my
939987 [5721] advantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin. And
939987 [5722] so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that
939987 [5723] I might be altogether forgiven.â€
939987 [5724] 
939987 [5725] 
939987 [5726] 
939987 [5727] Chapter VIII. Over The Brandy
939987 [5728] 
939987 [5729] 
939987 [5730] The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had
939987 [5731] been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy, and it
939987 [5732] was already a glass too much.
939987 [5733] 
939987 [5734] â€œGet along with you, Jesuits!â€ he cried to the servants. â€œGo away,
939987 [5735] Smerdyakov. Iâ€™ll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but be
939987 [5736] off! Donâ€™t cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. Sheâ€™ll comfort you and put you to
939987 [5737] bed. The rascals wonâ€™t let us sit in peace after dinner,â€ he snapped
939987 [5738] peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.
939987 [5739] 
939987 [5740] â€œSmerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. Itâ€™s you heâ€™s so
939987 [5741] interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?â€ he added to Ivan.
939987 [5742] 
939987 [5743] â€œNothing whatever,â€ answered Ivan. â€œHeâ€™s pleased to have a high opinion of
939987 [5744] me; heâ€™s a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution, however,
939987 [5745] when the time comes.â€
939987 [5746] 
939987 [5747] â€œFor revolution?â€
939987 [5748] 
939987 [5749] â€œThere will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him as
939987 [5750] well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.â€
939987 [5751] 
939987 [5752] â€œAnd when will the time come?â€
939987 [5753] 
939987 [5754] â€œThe rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not very
939987 [5755] fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.â€
939987 [5756] 
939987 [5757] â€œAh, brother, but a Balaamâ€™s ass like that thinks and thinks, and the
939987 [5758] devil knows where he gets to.â€
939987 [5759] 
939987 [5760] â€œHeâ€™s storing up ideas,â€ said Ivan, smiling.
939987 [5761] 
939987 [5762] â€œYou see, I know he canâ€™t bear me, nor any one else, even you, though you
939987 [5763] fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha, he
939987 [5764] despises Alyosha. But he doesnâ€™t steal, thatâ€™s one thing, and heâ€™s not a
939987 [5765] gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesnâ€™t wash our dirty linen in public.
939987 [5766] He makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth talking
939987 [5767] about so much?â€
939987 [5768] 
939987 [5769] â€œOf course he isnâ€™t.â€
939987 [5770] 
939987 [5771] â€œAnd as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant, generally
939987 [5772] speaking, needs thrashing. That Iâ€™ve always maintained. Our peasants are
939987 [5773] swindlers, and donâ€™t deserve to be pitied, and itâ€™s a good thing theyâ€™re
939987 [5774] still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed the
939987 [5775] forests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people.
939987 [5776] Weâ€™ve left off thrashing the peasants, weâ€™ve grown so clever, but they go
939987 [5777] on thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. â€˜For with what measure ye
939987 [5778] mete it shall be measured to you again,â€™ or how does it go? Anyhow, it
939987 [5779] will be measured. But Russiaâ€™s all swinishness. My dear, if you only knew
939987 [5780] how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice! But maybe I
939987 [5781] mean Russia. _Tout cela câ€™est de la cochonnerie_.... Do you know what I
939987 [5782] like? I like wit.â€
939987 [5783] 
939987 [5784] â€œYouâ€™ve had another glass. Thatâ€™s enough.â€
939987 [5785] 
939987 [5786] â€œWait a bit. Iâ€™ll have one more, and then another, and then Iâ€™ll stop. No,
939987 [5787] stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and he
939987 [5788] told me: â€˜Thereâ€™s nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to be
939987 [5789] thrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And the
939987 [5790] girl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in marriage to-morrow.
939987 [5791] So it quite suits the girls, too,â€™ he said. Thereâ€™s a set of de Sades for
939987 [5792] you! But itâ€™s clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh?
939987 [5793] Alyosha, are you blushing? Donâ€™t be bashful, child. Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t
939987 [5794] stay to dinner at the Superiorâ€™s and tell the monks about the girls at
939987 [5795] Mokroe. Alyosha, donâ€™t be angry that I offended your Superior this
939987 [5796] morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, of
939987 [5797] course, Iâ€™m to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if there
939987 [5798] isnâ€™t a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? Itâ€™s not enough to
939987 [5799] cut their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it,
939987 [5800] Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you donâ€™t believe it as I see
939987 [5801] from your eyes. You believe what people say, that Iâ€™m nothing but a
939987 [5802] buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that Iâ€™m nothing but a buffoon?â€
939987 [5803] 
939987 [5804] â€œNo, I donâ€™t believe it.â€
939987 [5805] 
939987 [5806] â€œAnd I believe you donâ€™t, and that you speak the truth. You look sincere
939987 [5807] and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivanâ€™s supercilious.... Iâ€™d make an
939987 [5808] end of your monks, though, all the same. Iâ€™d take all that mystic stuff
939987 [5809] and suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all the
939987 [5810] fools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into the
939987 [5811] mint!â€
939987 [5812] 
939987 [5813] â€œBut why suppress it?â€ asked Ivan.
939987 [5814] 
939987 [5815] â€œThat Truth may prevail. Thatâ€™s why.â€
939987 [5816] 
939987 [5817] â€œWell, if Truth were to prevail, you know, youâ€™d be the first to be robbed
939987 [5818] and suppressed.â€
939987 [5819] 
939987 [5820] â€œAh! I dare say youâ€™re right. Ah, Iâ€™m an ass!â€ burst out Fyodor
939987 [5821] Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. â€œWell, your
939987 [5822] monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if thatâ€™s how it is. And we clever
939987 [5823] people will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have
939987 [5824] been so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God or
939987 [5825] not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?â€
939987 [5826] 
939987 [5827] â€œIâ€™m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about
939987 [5828] Smerdyakovâ€™s belief in the existence of two saints who could move
939987 [5829] mountains.â€
939987 [5830] 
939987 [5831] â€œWhy, am I like him now, then?â€
939987 [5832] 
939987 [5833] â€œVery much.â€
939987 [5834] 
939987 [5835] â€œWell, that shows Iâ€™m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.
939987 [5836] And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall
939987 [5837] I catch you? What do you bet that Iâ€™ll catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the
939987 [5838] same, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious
939987 [5839] now.â€
939987 [5840] 
939987 [5841] â€œNo, there is no God.â€
939987 [5842] 
939987 [5843] â€œAlyosha, is there a God?â€
939987 [5844] 
939987 [5845] â€œThere is.â€
939987 [5846] 
939987 [5847] â€œIvan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny
939987 [5848] bit?â€
939987 [5849] 
939987 [5850] â€œThere is no immortality either.â€
939987 [5851] 
939987 [5852] â€œNone at all?â€
939987 [5853] 
939987 [5854] â€œNone at all.â€
939987 [5855] 
939987 [5856] â€œThereâ€™s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?
939987 [5857] Anything is better than nothing!â€
939987 [5858] 
939987 [5859] â€œAbsolute nothingness.â€
939987 [5860] 
939987 [5861] â€œAlyosha, is there immortality?â€
939987 [5862] 
939987 [5863] â€œThere is.â€
939987 [5864] 
939987 [5865] â€œGod and immortality?â€
939987 [5866] 
939987 [5867] â€œGod and immortality. In God is immortality.â€
939987 [5868] 
939987 [5869] â€œHâ€™m! Itâ€™s more likely Ivanâ€™s right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what
939987 [5870] force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for
939987 [5871] how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last
939987 [5872] time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!â€
939987 [5873] 
939987 [5874] â€œAnd for the last time there is not.â€
939987 [5875] 
939987 [5876] â€œWho is laughing at mankind, Ivan?â€
939987 [5877] 
939987 [5878] â€œIt must be the devil,â€ said Ivan, smiling.
939987 [5879] 
939987 [5880] â€œAnd the devil? Does he exist?â€
939987 [5881] 
939987 [5882] â€œNo, thereâ€™s no devil either.â€
939987 [5883] 
939987 [5884] â€œItâ€™s a pity. Damn it all, what wouldnâ€™t I do to the man who first
939987 [5885] invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for him.â€
939987 [5886] 
939987 [5887] â€œThere would have been no civilization if they hadnâ€™t invented God.â€
939987 [5888] 
939987 [5889] â€œWouldnâ€™t there have been? Without God?â€
939987 [5890] 
939987 [5891] â€œNo. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take your
939987 [5892] brandy away from you, anyway.â€
939987 [5893] 
939987 [5894] â€œStop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. Iâ€™ve hurt Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [5895] feelings. Youâ€™re not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!â€
939987 [5896] 
939987 [5897] â€œNo, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than your
939987 [5898] head.â€
939987 [5899] 
939987 [5900] â€œMy heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you. Ivan,
939987 [5901] do you love Alyosha?â€
939987 [5902] 
939987 [5903] â€œYes.â€
939987 [5904] 
939987 [5905] â€œYou must love himâ€ (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk).
939987 [5906] â€œListen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was
939987 [5907] excited. But thereâ€™s wit in that elder, donâ€™t you think, Ivan?â€
939987 [5908] 
939987 [5909] â€œVery likely.â€
939987 [5910] 
939987 [5911] â€œThere is, there is. _Il y a du Piron lÃ -dedans._ Heâ€™s a Jesuit, a Russian
939987 [5912] one, that is. As heâ€™s an honorable person thereâ€™s a hidden indignation
939987 [5913] boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.â€
939987 [5914] 
939987 [5915] â€œBut, of course, he believes in God.â€
939987 [5916] 
939987 [5917] â€œNot a bit of it. Didnâ€™t you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.
939987 [5918] That is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He said
939987 [5919] straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: â€˜_Credo_, but I donâ€™t know
939987 [5920] in what.â€™ â€
939987 [5921] 
939987 [5922] â€œReally?â€
939987 [5923] 
939987 [5924] â€œHe really did. But I respect him. Thereâ€™s something of Mephistopheles
939987 [5925] about him, or rather of â€˜The hero of our timeâ€™ ... Arbenin, or whatâ€™s his
939987 [5926] name?... You see, heâ€™s a sensualist. Heâ€™s such a sensualist that I should
939987 [5927] be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. You
939987 [5928] know, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last he invited
939987 [5929] us to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began
939987 [5930] telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially
939987 [5931] how he once cured a paralyzed woman. â€˜If my legs were not bad I know a
939987 [5932] dance I could dance you,â€™ he said. What do you say to that? â€˜Iâ€™ve plenty
939987 [5933] of tricks in my time,â€™ said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant, out of
939987 [5934] sixty thousand.â€
939987 [5935] 
939987 [5936] â€œWhat, he stole it?â€
939987 [5937] 
939987 [5938] â€œHe brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, â€˜Take care of
939987 [5939] it for me, friend, thereâ€™ll be a police search at my place to-morrow.â€™ And
939987 [5940] he kept it. â€˜You have given it to the Church,â€™ he declared. I said to him:
939987 [5941] â€˜Youâ€™re a scoundrel,â€™ I said. â€˜No,â€™ said he, â€˜Iâ€™m not a scoundrel, but Iâ€™m
939987 [5942] broad-minded.â€™ But that wasnâ€™t he, that was some one else. Iâ€™ve muddled
939987 [5943] him with some one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and
939987 [5944] thatâ€™s enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. Iâ€™ve been telling lies. Why
939987 [5945] didnâ€™t you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?â€
939987 [5946] 
939987 [5947] â€œI knew youâ€™d stop of yourself.â€
939987 [5948] 
939987 [5949] â€œThatâ€™s a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You
939987 [5950] despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.â€
939987 [5951] 
939987 [5952] â€œWell, Iâ€™m going away. Youâ€™ve had too much brandy.â€
939987 [5953] 
939987 [5954] â€œIâ€™ve begged you for Christâ€™s sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two,
939987 [5955] and you donâ€™t go.â€
939987 [5956] 
939987 [5957] â€œIâ€™ll go to-morrow if youâ€™re so set upon it.â€
939987 [5958] 
939987 [5959] â€œYou wonâ€™t go. You want to keep an eye on me. Thatâ€™s what you want,
939987 [5960] spiteful fellow. Thatâ€™s why you wonâ€™t go.â€
939987 [5961] 
939987 [5962] The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when the
939987 [5963] drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to
939987 [5964] assert himself.
939987 [5965] 
939987 [5966] â€œWhy are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at
939987 [5967] me and say, â€˜You ugly drunkard!â€™ Your eyes are mistrustful. Theyâ€™re
939987 [5968] contemptuous.... Youâ€™ve come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looks
939987 [5969] at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesnâ€™t despise me. Alexey, you mustnâ€™t
939987 [5970] love Ivan.â€
939987 [5971] 
939987 [5972] â€œDonâ€™t be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,â€ Alyosha
939987 [5973] said emphatically.
939987 [5974] 
939987 [5975] â€œOh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. Itâ€™s the
939987 [5976] third time Iâ€™ve told you.â€
939987 [5977] 
939987 [5978] He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.
939987 [5979] 
939987 [5980] â€œDonâ€™t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you donâ€™t love me, but
939987 [5981] donâ€™t be angry all the same. Youâ€™ve nothing to love me for. You go to
939987 [5982] Tchermashnya. Iâ€™ll come to you myself and bring you a present. Iâ€™ll show
939987 [5983] you a little wench there. Iâ€™ve had my eye on her a long time. Sheâ€™s still
939987 [5984] running about bare-foot. Donâ€™t be afraid of bare-footed wenchesâ€”donâ€™t
939987 [5985] despise themâ€”theyâ€™re pearls!â€
939987 [5986] 
939987 [5987] And he kissed his hand with a smack.
939987 [5988] 
939987 [5989] â€œTo my thinking,â€ he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant he
939987 [5990] touched on his favorite topic. â€œTo my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You
939987 [5991] children, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a woman
939987 [5992] ugly in my lifeâ€”thatâ€™s been my rule! Can you understand that? How could
939987 [5993] you understand it? Youâ€™ve milk in your veins, not blood. Youâ€™re not out of
939987 [5994] your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something
939987 [5995] devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldnâ€™t find in any other.
939987 [5996] Only, one must know how to find it, thatâ€™s the point! Thatâ€™s a talent! To
939987 [5997] my mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she is a woman is half
939987 [5998] the battle ... but how could you understand that? Even in _vieilles
939987 [5999] filles_, even in them you may discover something that makes you simply
939987 [6000] wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without
939987 [6001] noticing them. Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by
939987 [6002] surprise. Didnâ€™t you know that? You must astound them till theyâ€™re
939987 [6003] fascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with
939987 [6004] such a little slut. Itâ€™s a jolly good thing that there always are and will
939987 [6005] be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little
939987 [6006] maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s needed
939987 [6007] for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your
939987 [6008] mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her at all, but all
939987 [6009] at once, when the minute came, Iâ€™d be all devotion to her, crawl on my
939987 [6010] knees, kiss her feet, and I always, alwaysâ€”I remember it as though it were
939987 [6011] to-dayâ€”reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh.
939987 [6012] It was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that.
939987 [6013] The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh
939987 [6014] was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. Thatâ€™s
939987 [6015] the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavskyâ€”he was a
939987 [6016] handsome fellow, and richâ€”used to like to come here and hang about
939987 [6017] herâ€”suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence. And sheâ€”such a
939987 [6018] mild sheepâ€”why, I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow.
939987 [6019] How she set on me! â€˜Youâ€™re beaten, beaten now,â€™ she said. â€˜Youâ€™ve taken a
939987 [6020] blow from him. You have been trying to sell me to him,â€™ she said.... â€˜And
939987 [6021] how dared he strike you in my presence! Donâ€™t dare come near me again,
939987 [6022] never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!â€™... I took her to the
939987 [6023] monastery then to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her
939987 [6024] back to reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor
939987 [6025] crazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fond
939987 [6026] of praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used
939987 [6027] to turn me out of her room then. Iâ€™ll knock that mysticism out of her,
939987 [6028] thought I! â€˜Here,â€™ said I, â€˜you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I
939987 [6029] take it down. You believe itâ€™s miraculous, but here, Iâ€™ll spit on it
939987 [6030] directly and nothing will happen to me for it!â€™... When she saw it, good
939987 [6031] Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her
939987 [6032] hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and
939987 [6033] fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, whatâ€™s the
939987 [6034] matter?â€
939987 [6035] 
939987 [6036] The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about
939987 [6037] his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyoshaâ€™s face. He flushed
939987 [6038] crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone
939987 [6039] spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very
939987 [6040] strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy
939987 [6041] woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat
939987 [6042] exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face
939987 [6043] in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical
939987 [6044] paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance
939987 [6045] to his mother particularly impressed the old man.
939987 [6046] 
939987 [6047] â€œIvan, Ivan! Water, quickly! Itâ€™s like her, exactly as she used to be
939987 [6048] then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, thatâ€™s what I
939987 [6049] used to do to her. Heâ€™s upset about his mother, his mother,â€ he muttered
939987 [6050] to Ivan.
939987 [6051] 
939987 [6052] â€œBut she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?â€ said
939987 [6053] Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his
939987 [6054] flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a
939987 [6055] second; it seemed really to have escaped the old manâ€™s mind that Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [6056] mother actually was the mother of Ivan too.
939987 [6057] 
939987 [6058] â€œYour mother?â€ he muttered, not understanding. â€œWhat do you mean? What
939987 [6059] mother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was
939987 [6060] yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me,
939987 [6061] why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!â€ He stopped. A broad, drunken,
939987 [6062] half-senseless grin overspread his face.
939987 [6063] 
939987 [6064] At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there
939987 [6065] were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the
939987 [6066] room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
939987 [6067] 
939987 [6068] â€œHeâ€™ll kill me! Heâ€™ll kill me! Donâ€™t let him get at me!â€ he screamed,
939987 [6069] clinging to the skirt of Ivanâ€™s coat.
939987 [6070] 
939987 [6071] 
939987 [6072] 
939987 [6073] Chapter IX. The Sensualists
939987 [6074] 
939987 [6075] 
939987 [6076] Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been
939987 [6077] struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on
939987 [6078] instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking
939987 [6079] advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to
939987 [6080] look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on
939987 [6081] the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood
939987 [6082] before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the
939987 [6083] entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,
939987 [6084] Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
939987 [6085] 
939987 [6086] â€œThen sheâ€™s there! Sheâ€™s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!â€
939987 [6087] 
939987 [6088] He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside
939987 [6089] himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might.
939987 [6090] The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the
939987 [6091] door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room,
939987 [6092] huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
939987 [6093] 
939987 [6094] â€œSheâ€™s here!â€ shouted Dmitri. â€œI saw her turn towards the house just now,
939987 [6095] but I couldnâ€™t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?â€
939987 [6096] 
939987 [6097] That shout, â€œSheâ€™s here!â€ produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor
939987 [6098] Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.
939987 [6099] 
939987 [6100] â€œHold him! Hold him!â€ he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory
939987 [6101] had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran
939987 [6102] after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the
939987 [6103] floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vaseâ€”not an expensive
939987 [6104] oneâ€”on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.
939987 [6105] 
939987 [6106] â€œAt him!â€ shouted the old man. â€œHelp!â€
939987 [6107] 
939987 [6108] Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back.
939987 [6109] 
939987 [6110] â€œWhy do you run after him? Heâ€™ll murder you outright,â€ Ivan cried
939987 [6111] wrathfully at his father.
939987 [6112] 
939987 [6113] â€œIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenkaâ€™s here. He said he saw her
939987 [6114] himself, running.â€
939987 [6115] 
939987 [6116] He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden
939987 [6117] news that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling all over.
939987 [6118] He seemed frantic.
939987 [6119] 
939987 [6120] â€œBut youâ€™ve seen for yourself that she hasnâ€™t come,â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [6121] 
939987 [6122] â€œBut she may have come by that other entrance.â€
939987 [6123] 
939987 [6124] â€œYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.â€
939987 [6125] 
939987 [6126] Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of course, found
939987 [6127] the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [6128] pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could
939987 [6129] not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.
939987 [6130] 
939987 [6131] â€œHold him!â€ shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. â€œHeâ€™s
939987 [6132] been stealing money in my bedroom.â€ And tearing himself from Ivan he
939987 [6133] rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly
939987 [6134] clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his
939987 [6135] temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He
939987 [6136] kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man
939987 [6137] moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round
939987 [6138] him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his
939987 [6139] slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
939987 [6140] 
939987 [6141] â€œMadman! Youâ€™ve killed him!â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [6142] 
939987 [6143] â€œServe him right!â€ shouted Dmitri breathlessly. â€œIf I havenâ€™t killed him,
939987 [6144] Iâ€™ll come again and kill him. You canâ€™t protect him!â€
939987 [6145] 
939987 [6146] â€œDmitri! Go away at once!â€ cried Alyosha commandingly.
939987 [6147] 
939987 [6148] â€œAlexey! You tell me. Itâ€™s only you I can believe; was she here just now,
939987 [6149] or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. I
939987 [6150] shouted, she ran away.â€
939987 [6151] 
939987 [6152] â€œI swear sheâ€™s not been here, and no one expected her.â€
939987 [6153] 
939987 [6154] â€œBut I saw her.... So she must ... Iâ€™ll find out at once where she is....
939987 [6155] Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to Ã†sop about the money now. But go to
939987 [6156] Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, â€˜He sends his compliments to
939987 [6157] you!â€™ Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and farewell!
939987 [6158] Describe the scene to her.â€
939987 [6159] 
939987 [6160] Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an
939987 [6161] arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious and
939987 [6162] listened greedily to Dmitriâ€™s cries. He was still fancying that Grushenka
939987 [6163] really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he
939987 [6164] went out.
939987 [6165] 
939987 [6166] â€œI donâ€™t repent shedding your blood!â€ he cried. â€œBeware, old man, beware
939987 [6167] of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown you
939987 [6168] altogether.â€
939987 [6169] 
939987 [6170] He ran out of the room.
939987 [6171] 
939987 [6172] â€œSheâ€™s here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!â€ the old man
939987 [6173] wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.
939987 [6174] 
939987 [6175] â€œNo, sheâ€™s not here, you old lunatic!â€ Ivan shouted at him angrily. â€œHere,
939987 [6176] heâ€™s fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!â€
939987 [6177] 
939987 [6178] Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and put
939987 [6179] him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by the
939987 [6180] brandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he shut his
939987 [6181] eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Ivan and
939987 [6182] Alyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of
939987 [6183] the broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the
939987 [6184] floor.
939987 [6185] 
939987 [6186] â€œShouldnâ€™t you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?â€ Alyosha
939987 [6187] said to him. â€œWeâ€™ll look after him. My brother gave you a terrible blowâ€”on
939987 [6188] the head.â€
939987 [6189] 
939987 [6190] â€œHeâ€™s insulted me!â€ Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.
939987 [6191] 
939987 [6192] â€œHeâ€™s â€˜insultedâ€™ his father, not only you,â€ observed Ivan with a forced
939987 [6193] smile.
939987 [6194] 
939987 [6195] â€œI used to wash him in his tub. Heâ€™s insulted me,â€ repeated Grigory.
939987 [6196] 
939987 [6197] â€œDamn it all, if I hadnâ€™t pulled him away perhaps heâ€™d have murdered him.
939987 [6198] It wouldnâ€™t take much to do for Ã†sop, would it?â€ whispered Ivan to
939987 [6199] Alyosha.
939987 [6200] 
939987 [6201] â€œGod forbid!â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [6202] 
939987 [6203] â€œWhy should He forbid?â€ Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignant
939987 [6204] grimace. â€œOne reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right,
939987 [6205] too.â€
939987 [6206] 
939987 [6207] Alyosha shuddered.
939987 [6208] 
939987 [6209] â€œOf course I wonâ€™t let him be murdered as I didnâ€™t just now. Stay here,
939987 [6210] Alyosha, Iâ€™ll go for a turn in the yard. My headâ€™s begun to ache.â€
939987 [6211] 
939987 [6212] Alyosha went to his fatherâ€™s bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the
939987 [6213] screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed
939987 [6214] for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at
939987 [6215] once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.
939987 [6216] 
939987 [6217] â€œAlyosha,â€ he whispered apprehensively, â€œwhereâ€™s Ivan?â€
939987 [6218] 
939987 [6219] â€œIn the yard. Heâ€™s got a headache. Heâ€™s on the watch.â€
939987 [6220] 
939987 [6221] â€œGive me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.â€
939987 [6222] 
939987 [6223] Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the
939987 [6224] chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was
939987 [6225] considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a
939987 [6226] rather large crimson bruise.
939987 [6227] 
939987 [6228] â€œWhat does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, Iâ€™m afraid of Ivan.
939987 [6229] Iâ€™m more afraid of Ivan than the other. Youâ€™re the only one Iâ€™m not afraid
939987 [6230] of....â€
939987 [6231] 
939987 [6232] â€œDonâ€™t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but heâ€™ll defend you.â€
939987 [6233] 
939987 [6234] â€œAlyosha, and what of the other? Heâ€™s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me
939987 [6235] the truth, was she here just now or not?â€
939987 [6236] 
939987 [6237] â€œNo one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.â€
939987 [6238] 
939987 [6239] â€œYou know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.â€
939987 [6240] 
939987 [6241] â€œShe wonâ€™t marry him.â€
939987 [6242] 
939987 [6243] â€œShe wonâ€™t. She wonâ€™t. She wonâ€™t. She wonâ€™t on any account!â€
939987 [6244] 
939987 [6245] The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting
939987 [6246] could have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyoshaâ€™s hand and
939987 [6247] pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes.
939987 [6248] 
939987 [6249] â€œThat image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,â€ he
939987 [6250] said. â€œTake it home and keep it for yourself. And Iâ€™ll let you go back to
939987 [6251] the monastery.... I was joking this morning, donâ€™t be angry with me. My
939987 [6252] head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me
939987 [6253] the truth!â€
939987 [6254] 
939987 [6255] â€œYouâ€™re still asking whether she has been here or not?â€ Alyosha said
939987 [6256] sorrowfully.
939987 [6257] 
939987 [6258] â€œNo, no, no. I believe you. Iâ€™ll tell you what it is: you go to Grushenka
939987 [6259] yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for yourself,
939987 [6260] which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?â€
939987 [6261] 
939987 [6262] â€œIf I see her Iâ€™ll ask her,â€ Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.
939987 [6263] 
939987 [6264] â€œNo, she wonâ€™t tell you,â€ the old man interrupted, â€œsheâ€™s a rogue. Sheâ€™ll
939987 [6265] begin kissing you and say that itâ€™s you she wants. Sheâ€™s a deceitful,
939987 [6266] shameless hussy. You mustnâ€™t go to her, you mustnâ€™t!â€
939987 [6267] 
939987 [6268] â€œNo, father, and it wouldnâ€™t be suitable, it wouldnâ€™t be right at all.â€
939987 [6269] 
939987 [6270] â€œWhere was he sending you just now? He shouted â€˜Goâ€™ as he ran away.â€
939987 [6271] 
939987 [6272] â€œTo Katerina Ivanovna.â€
939987 [6273] 
939987 [6274] â€œFor money? To ask her for money?â€
939987 [6275] 
939987 [6276] â€œNo. Not for money.â€
939987 [6277] 
939987 [6278] â€œHeâ€™s no money; not a farthing. Iâ€™ll settle down for the night, and think
939987 [6279] things over, and you can go. Perhaps youâ€™ll meet her.... Only be sure to
939987 [6280] come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word to say to
939987 [6281] you to-morrow. Will you come?â€
939987 [6282] 
939987 [6283] â€œYes.â€
939987 [6284] 
939987 [6285] â€œWhen you come, pretend youâ€™ve come of your own accord to ask after me.
939987 [6286] Donâ€™t tell any one I told you to. Donâ€™t say a word to Ivan.â€
939987 [6287] 
939987 [6288] â€œVery well.â€
939987 [6289] 
939987 [6290] â€œGood-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forget
939987 [6291] it. Iâ€™ve a word to say to you to-morrowâ€”but I must think about it.â€
939987 [6292] 
939987 [6293] â€œAnd how do you feel now?â€
939987 [6294] 
939987 [6295] â€œI shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!â€
939987 [6296] 
939987 [6297] Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway.
939987 [6298] He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note-book. Alyosha told
939987 [6299] Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him go
939987 [6300] back to sleep at the monastery.
939987 [6301] 
939987 [6302] â€œAlyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,â€ said Ivan
939987 [6303] cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.
939987 [6304] 
939987 [6305] â€œI shall be at the Hohlakovsâ€™ to-morrow,â€ answered Alyosha, â€œI may be at
939987 [6306] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s, too, if I donâ€™t find her now.â€
939987 [6307] 
939987 [6308] â€œBut youâ€™re going to her now, anyway? For that â€˜compliments and
939987 [6309] farewell,â€™ â€ said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
939987 [6310] 
939987 [6311] â€œI think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what
939987 [6312] went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that heâ€”well, in
939987 [6313] factâ€”takes his leave of her?â€
939987 [6314] 
939987 [6315] â€œBrother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?â€
939987 [6316] exclaimed Alyosha.
939987 [6317] 
939987 [6318] â€œOne canâ€™t tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.
939987 [6319] That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and
939987 [6320] not let Dmitri in the house.â€
939987 [6321] 
939987 [6322] â€œBrother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other
939987 [6323] men and decide which is worthy to live?â€
939987 [6324] 
939987 [6325] â€œWhy bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in
939987 [6326] menâ€™s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rightsâ€”who has
939987 [6327] not the right to wish?â€
939987 [6328] 
939987 [6329] â€œNot for another manâ€™s death?â€
939987 [6330] 
939987 [6331] â€œWhat even if for another manâ€™s death? Why lie to oneself since all men
939987 [6332] live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I
939987 [6333] said just nowâ€”that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let me
939987 [6334] ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Ã†sopâ€™s blood,
939987 [6335] murdering him, eh?â€
939987 [6336] 
939987 [6337] â€œWhat are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I donâ€™t
939987 [6338] think Dmitri is capable of it, either.â€
939987 [6339] 
939987 [6340] â€œThanks, if only for that,â€ smiled Ivan. â€œBe sure, I should always defend
939987 [6341] him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good-by
939987 [6342] till to-morrow. Donâ€™t condemn me, and donâ€™t look on me as a villain,â€ he
939987 [6343] added with a smile.
939987 [6344] 
939987 [6345] They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt that
939987 [6346] his brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had
939987 [6347] certainly done this with some definite motive.
939987 [6348] 
939987 [6349] 
939987 [6350] 
939987 [6351] Chapter X. Both Together
939987 [6352] 
939987 [6353] 
939987 [6354] Alyosha left his fatherâ€™s house feeling even more exhausted and dejected
939987 [6355] in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and
939987 [6356] unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed
939987 [6357] fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting
939987 [6358] experiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he
939987 [6359] had never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest
939987 [6360] stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his
939987 [6361] father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself
939987 [6362] been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet
939987 [6363] only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely
939987 [6364] unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there were
939987 [6365] other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed
939987 [6366] before. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had
939987 [6367] made a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring.
939987 [6368] Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these
939987 [6369] women? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s
939987 [6370] in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the
939987 [6371] contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from
939987 [6372] her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than
939987 [6373] before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and
939987 [6374] Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to
939987 [6375] any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the
939987 [6376] scene which had just taken place with his father.
939987 [6377] 
939987 [6378] It was by now seven oâ€™clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered
939987 [6379] the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by
939987 [6380] Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One of
939987 [6381] them, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half-sister Agafya
939987 [6382] Ivanovna who had looked after her in her fatherâ€™s house when she came from
939987 [6383] boarding-school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and
939987 [6384] consequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they
939987 [6385] both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept
939987 [6386] them with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one
939987 [6387] but her benefactress, the generalâ€™s widow, who had been kept by illness in
939987 [6388] Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account
939987 [6389] of all her doings.
939987 [6390] 
939987 [6391] When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to
939987 [6392] him to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware of
939987 [6393] his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least,
939987 [6394] Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling
939987 [6395] skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.
939987 [6396] 
939987 [6397] Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement.
939987 [6398] He was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room,
939987 [6399] elegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style. There were
939987 [6400] many sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. There were pictures
939987 [6401] on the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even
939987 [6402] an aquarium in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made
939987 [6403] out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just
939987 [6404] been sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups
939987 [6405] of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another with
939987 [6406] sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. But
939987 [6407] at that instant the portiÃ¨re was raised, and with rapid, hurrying
939987 [6408] footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha
939987 [6409] with a radiant smile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in
939987 [6410] two lighted candles and set them on the table.
939987 [6411] 
939987 [6412] â€œThank God! At last you have come too! Iâ€™ve been simply praying for you
939987 [6413] all day! Sit down.â€
939987 [6414] 
939987 [6415] Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s beauty when, three weeks
939987 [6416] before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s special
939987 [6417] request, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation between
939987 [6418] them at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very shy,
939987 [6419] Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha
939987 [6420] had been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck
939987 [6421] by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl.
939987 [6422] And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He
939987 [6423] thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her
939987 [6424] pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the lines
939987 [6425] of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might
939987 [6426] well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for
939987 [6427] long. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the
939987 [6428] visit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his
939987 [6429] impressions on seeing his betrothed.
939987 [6430] 
939987 [6431] â€œYouâ€™ll be happy with her, but perhapsâ€”not tranquilly happy.â€
939987 [6432] 
939987 [6433] â€œQuite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They donâ€™t yield
939987 [6434] to fate. So you think I shanâ€™t love her for ever.â€
939987 [6435] 
939987 [6436] â€œNo; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you wonâ€™t always be
939987 [6437] happy with her.â€
939987 [6438] 
939987 [6439] Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with
939987 [6440] himself for having yielded to his brotherâ€™s entreaties and put such
939987 [6441] â€œfoolishâ€ ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfully
939987 [6442] foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of having
939987 [6443] given so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the more
939987 [6444] amazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as
939987 [6445] she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This time
939987 [6446] her face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct
939987 [6447] warm-hearted sincerity. The â€œpride and haughtiness,â€ which had struck
939987 [6448] Alyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy
939987 [6449] and a sort of bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the
939987 [6450] first glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in
939987 [6451] relation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she
939987 [6452] perhaps already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite
939987 [6453] of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future.
939987 [6454] Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. He
939987 [6455] was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed at
939987 [6456] her first words that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps
939987 [6457] quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.
939987 [6458] 
939987 [6459] â€œI was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole
939987 [6460] truthâ€”from you and no one else.â€
939987 [6461] 
939987 [6462] â€œI have come,â€ muttered Alyosha confusedly, â€œIâ€”he sent me.â€
939987 [6463] 
939987 [6464] â€œAh, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everythingâ€”everything!â€ cried
939987 [6465] Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. â€œWait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
939987 [6466] Iâ€™ll tell you why Iâ€™ve been so longing to see you. You see, I know perhaps
939987 [6467] far more than you do yourself, and thereâ€™s no need for you to tell me
939987 [6468] anything. Iâ€™ll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own last
939987 [6469] impression of him. I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely
939987 [6470] even (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and
939987 [6471] of his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps be
939987 [6472] better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does not want
939987 [6473] to come to me. Do you understand what I want from you? Now, tell me
939987 [6474] simply, tell me every word of the message he sent you with (I knew he
939987 [6475] would send you).â€
939987 [6476] 
939987 [6477] â€œHe told me to give you his complimentsâ€”and to say that he would never
939987 [6478] come againâ€”but to give you his compliments.â€
939987 [6479] 
939987 [6480] â€œHis compliments? Was that what he saidâ€”his own expression?â€
939987 [6481] 
939987 [6482] â€œYes.â€
939987 [6483] 
939987 [6484] â€œAccidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did not
939987 [6485] use the right word?â€
939987 [6486] 
939987 [6487] â€œNo; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or three
939987 [6488] times not to forget to say so.â€
939987 [6489] 
939987 [6490] Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.
939987 [6491] 
939987 [6492] â€œHelp me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. Iâ€™ll tell
939987 [6493] you what I think, and you must simply say whether itâ€™s right or not.
939987 [6494] Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without insisting on
939987 [6495] your repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the end
939987 [6496] of everything! But if he particularly insisted on those words, if he
939987 [6497] particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he
939987 [6498] was in excitement, beside himself. He had made his decision and was
939987 [6499] frightened at it. He wasnâ€™t walking away from me with a resolute step, but
939987 [6500] leaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply
939987 [6501] bravado.â€
939987 [6502] 
939987 [6503] â€œYes, yes!â€ cried Alyosha warmly. â€œI believe that is it.â€
939987 [6504] 
939987 [6505] â€œAnd, if so, heâ€™s not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! Did he
939987 [6506] not tell you anything about moneyâ€”about three thousand roubles?â€
939987 [6507] 
939987 [6508] â€œHe did speak about it, and itâ€™s that more than anything thatâ€™s crushing
939987 [6509] him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now,â€ Alyosha
939987 [6510] answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that
939987 [6511] there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother. â€œBut
939987 [6512] do you know about the money?â€ he added, and suddenly broke off.
939987 [6513] 
939987 [6514] â€œIâ€™ve known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and
939987 [6515] heard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadnâ€™t sent the money,
939987 [6516] but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money.
939987 [6517] My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn, and
939987 [6518] who was his true friend. No, he wonâ€™t recognize that I am his truest
939987 [6519] friend; he wonâ€™t know me, and looks on me merely as a woman. Iâ€™ve been
939987 [6520] tormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being
939987 [6521] ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel
939987 [6522] ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other peopleâ€™s knowing, but not
939987 [6523] of my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it he
939987 [6524] still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why,
939987 [6525] why doesnâ€™t he know me? How dare he not know me after all that has
939987 [6526] happened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed.
939987 [6527] And here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasnâ€™t afraid
939987 [6528] to be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I donâ€™t deserve
939987 [6529] the same?â€
939987 [6530] 
939987 [6531] The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.
939987 [6532] 
939987 [6533] â€œI must tell you,â€ Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, â€œwhat happened
939987 [6534] just now between him and my father.â€
939987 [6535] 
939987 [6536] And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the
939987 [6537] money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that had
939987 [6538] again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and
939987 [6539] farewell. â€œHe went to that woman,â€ Alyosha added softly.
939987 [6540] 
939987 [6541] â€œAnd do you suppose that I canâ€™t put up with that woman? Does he think I
939987 [6542] canâ€™t? But he wonâ€™t marry her,â€ she suddenly laughed nervously. â€œCould
939987 [6543] such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? Itâ€™s passion, not love. He
939987 [6544] wonâ€™t marry her because she wonâ€™t marry him.â€ Again Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [6545] laughed strangely.
939987 [6546] 
939987 [6547] â€œHe may marry her,â€ said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
939987 [6548] 
939987 [6549] â€œHe wonâ€™t marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that?
939987 [6550] Do you know that?â€ Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary
939987 [6551] warmth. â€œShe is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I know
939987 [6552] how bewitching she is, but I know too that she is kind, firm and noble.
939987 [6553] Why do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are
939987 [6554] wondering at my words, perhaps you donâ€™t believe me? Agrafena
939987 [6555] Alexandrovna, my angel!â€ she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the
939987 [6556] next room, â€œcome in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He knows all
939987 [6557] about our affairs. Show yourself to him.â€
939987 [6558] 
939987 [6559] â€œIâ€™ve only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,â€ said a
939987 [6560] soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
939987 [6561] 
939987 [6562] The portiÃ¨re was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, came
939987 [6563] up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed his
939987 [6564] eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful woman,
939987 [6565] the â€œbeast,â€ as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet one would
939987 [6566] have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, a
939987 [6567] good-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsome
939987 [6568] ordinary women! It is true she was very, very good-looking with that
939987 [6569] Russian beauty so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall
939987 [6570] woman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was
939987 [6571] exceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were,
939987 [6572] noiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her
939987 [6573] voice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step,
939987 [6574] but noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She sank
939987 [6575] softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress,
939987 [6576] and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a
939987 [6577] costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and her face looked
939987 [6578] exactly that age. She was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint on
939987 [6579] her cheeks. The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and
939987 [6580] the lower jaw was set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the
939987 [6581] slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked
939987 [6582] pouting. But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored
939987 [6583] eyebrows and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have
939987 [6584] made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the
939987 [6585] street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. What
939987 [6586] struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good
939987 [6587] nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childish
939987 [6588] delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to
939987 [6589] expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. The
939987 [6590] light in her eyes gladdened the soulâ€”Alyosha felt that. There was
939987 [6591] something else in her which he could not understand, or would not have
939987 [6592] been able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. It
939987 [6593] was that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that
939987 [6594] catlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl
939987 [6595] could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her
939987 [6596] figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in
939987 [6597] somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs of
939987 [6598] Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, still
939987 [6599] youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, would
939987 [6600] â€œspreadâ€; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would very
939987 [6601] soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes; the complexion would
939987 [6602] grow coarse and red perhapsâ€”in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment,
939987 [6603] the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women. Alyosha,
939987 [6604] of course, did not think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he
939987 [6605] wondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she
939987 [6606] drawled in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
939987 [6607] feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the
939987 [6608] syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad
939987 [6609] education and a false idea of good manners. And yet this intonation and
939987 [6610] manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with
939987 [6611] the childishly simple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyish
939987 [6612] joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an
939987 [6613] arm-chair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on her
939987 [6614] smiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.
939987 [6615] 
939987 [6616] â€œThis is the first time weâ€™ve met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ she said
939987 [6617] rapturously. â€œI wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her, but
939987 [6618] Iâ€™d no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I knew we should
939987 [6619] settle everything togetherâ€”everything. My heart told me soâ€”I was begged
939987 [6620] not to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the
939987 [6621] difficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything to
939987 [6622] me, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness
939987 [6623] and brought us peace and joy.â€
939987 [6624] 
939987 [6625] â€œYou did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,â€ drawled Grushenka
939987 [6626] in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.
939987 [6627] 
939987 [6628] â€œDonâ€™t dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain
939987 [6629] you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though it
939987 [6630] were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how she
939987 [6631] laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does oneâ€™s heart good to see the angel.â€
939987 [6632] 
939987 [6633] Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.
939987 [6634] 
939987 [6635] â€œYou make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all
939987 [6636] worthy of your kindness.â€
939987 [6637] 
939987 [6638] â€œNot worthy! Sheâ€™s not worthy of it!â€ Katerina Ivanovna cried again with
939987 [6639] the same warmth. â€œYou know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, weâ€™re fanciful, weâ€™re
939987 [6640] self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. Weâ€™re noble,
939987 [6641] weâ€™re generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only been
939987 [6642] unfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy,
939987 [6643] perhaps, or fickle man. There was one manâ€”one, an officer too, we loved
939987 [6644] him, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago,
939987 [6645] and he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has
939987 [6646] written, he is coming here, and, do you know, weâ€™ve loved him, none but
939987 [6647] him, all this time, and weâ€™ve loved him all our life! He will come, and
939987 [6648] Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years sheâ€™s been
939987 [6649] wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her favor? Only that
939987 [6650] bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her father, her friend, her
939987 [6651] protector. He found her then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man she
939987 [6652] loved. She was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant saved
939987 [6653] herâ€”saved her!â€
939987 [6654] 
939987 [6655] â€œYou defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurry
939987 [6656] about everything,â€ Grushenka drawled again.
939987 [6657] 
939987 [6658] â€œDefend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?
939987 [6659] Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little
939987 [6660] hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and has
939987 [6661] lifted me up, and Iâ€™m going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here,
939987 [6662] here!â€
939987 [6663] 
939987 [6664] And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, hand
939987 [6665] of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a charming
939987 [6666] musical, nervous little laugh, watched the â€œsweet young lady,â€ and
939987 [6667] obviously liked having her hand kissed.
939987 [6668] 
939987 [6669] â€œPerhaps thereâ€™s rather too much rapture,â€ thought Alyosha. He blushed. He
939987 [6670] felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
939987 [6671] 
939987 [6672] â€œYou wonâ€™t make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this
939987 [6673] before Alexey Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [6674] 
939987 [6675] â€œDo you think I meant to make you blush?â€ said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhat
939987 [6676] surprised. â€œAh, my dear, how little you understand me!â€
939987 [6677] 
939987 [6678] â€œYes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady. Maybe
939987 [6679] Iâ€™m not so good as I seem to you. Iâ€™ve a bad heart; I will have my own
939987 [6680] way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.â€
939987 [6681] 
939987 [6682] â€œBut now youâ€™ll save him. Youâ€™ve given me your word. Youâ€™ll explain it all
939987 [6683] to him. Youâ€™ll break to him that you have long loved another man, who is
939987 [6684] now offering you his hand.â€
939987 [6685] 
939987 [6686] â€œOh, no! I didnâ€™t give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking
939987 [6687] about that. I didnâ€™t give you my word.â€
939987 [6688] 
939987 [6689] â€œThen I didnâ€™t quite understand you,â€ said Katerina Ivanovna slowly,
939987 [6690] turning a little pale. â€œYou promisedâ€”â€
939987 [6691] 
939987 [6692] â€œOh, no, angel lady, Iâ€™ve promised nothing,â€ Grushenka interrupted softly
939987 [6693] and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. â€œYou see at
939987 [6694] once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If I
939987 [6695] want to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise just now. But
939987 [6696] now again Iâ€™m thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much
939987 [6697] onceâ€”liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him
939987 [6698] to stay with me from this day forward. You see, Iâ€™m so changeable.â€
939987 [6699] 
939987 [6700] â€œJust now you saidâ€”something quite different,â€ Katerina Ivanovna whispered
939987 [6701] faintly.
939987 [6702] 
939987 [6703] â€œAh, just now! But, you know. Iâ€™m such a soft-hearted, silly creature.
939987 [6704] Only think what heâ€™s gone through on my account! What if when I go home I
939987 [6705] feel sorry for him? What then?â€
939987 [6706] 
939987 [6707] â€œI never expectedâ€”â€
939987 [6708] 
939987 [6709] â€œAh, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now
939987 [6710] perhaps you wonâ€™t care for a silly creature like me, now you know my
939987 [6711] character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,â€ she said
939987 [6712] tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s hand.
939987 [6713] 
939987 [6714] â€œHere, dear young lady, Iâ€™ll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine.
939987 [6715] You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times
939987 [6716] to be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as God
939987 [6717] wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding
939987 [6718] like a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises.
939987 [6719] What a sweet handâ€”what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you
939987 [6720] incredible beauty!â€
939987 [6721] 
939987 [6722] She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed of
939987 [6723] â€œbeing evenâ€ with her in kisses.
939987 [6724] 
939987 [6725] Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid hope
939987 [6726] to the last words, though Grushenkaâ€™s promise to do her bidding like a
939987 [6727] slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her eyes; she
939987 [6728] still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, the
939987 [6729] same bright gayety.
939987 [6730] 
939987 [6731] â€œSheâ€™s perhaps too naÃ¯ve,â€ thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of
939987 [6732] hope.
939987 [6733] 
939987 [6734] Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the â€œsweet hand.â€ She raised
939987 [6735] it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes near
939987 [6736] her lips, as though reconsidering something.
939987 [6737] 
939987 [6738] â€œDo you know, angel lady,â€ she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and
939987 [6739] sugary voice, â€œdo you know, after all, I think I wonâ€™t kiss your hand?â€
939987 [6740] And she laughed a little merry laugh.
939987 [6741] 
939987 [6742] â€œAs you please. Whatâ€™s the matter with you?â€ said Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [6743] starting suddenly.
939987 [6744] 
939987 [6745] â€œSo that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didnâ€™t
939987 [6746] kiss yours.â€
939987 [6747] 
939987 [6748] There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness at
939987 [6749] Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [6750] 
939987 [6751] â€œInsolent creature!â€ cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping
939987 [6752] something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.
939987 [6753] 
939987 [6754] Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
939987 [6755] 
939987 [6756] â€œSo I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didnâ€™t kiss yours at
939987 [6757] all. And how he will laugh!â€
939987 [6758] 
939987 [6759] â€œVile slut! Go away!â€
939987 [6760] 
939987 [6761] â€œAh, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! Thatâ€™s unbecoming for you, dear
939987 [6762] young lady, a word like that.â€
939987 [6763] 
939987 [6764] â€œGo away! Youâ€™re a creature for sale!â€ screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every
939987 [6765] feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
939987 [6766] 
939987 [6767] â€œFor sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once;
939987 [6768] you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.â€
939987 [6769] 
939987 [6770] Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha held
939987 [6771] her with all his strength.
939987 [6772] 
939987 [6773] â€œNot a step, not a word! Donâ€™t speak, donâ€™t answer her. Sheâ€™ll go
939987 [6774] awayâ€”sheâ€™ll go at once.â€
939987 [6775] 
939987 [6776] At that instant Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s two aunts ran in at her cry, and with
939987 [6777] them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.
939987 [6778] 
939987 [6779] â€œI will go away,â€ said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa.
939987 [6780] â€œAlyosha, darling, see me home!â€
939987 [6781] 
939987 [6782] â€œGo awayâ€”go away, make haste!â€ cried Alyosha, clasping his hands
939987 [6783] imploringly.
939987 [6784] 
939987 [6785] â€œDear little Alyosha, see me home! Iâ€™ve got a pretty little story to tell
939987 [6786] you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See me
939987 [6787] home, dear, youâ€™ll be glad of it afterwards.â€
939987 [6788] 
939987 [6789] Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house,
939987 [6790] laughing musically.
939987 [6791] 
939987 [6792] Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shaken
939987 [6793] with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.
939987 [6794] 
939987 [6795] â€œI warned you,â€ said the elder of her aunts. â€œI tried to prevent your
939987 [6796] doing this. Youâ€™re too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You donâ€™t
939987 [6797] know these creatures, and they say sheâ€™s worse than any of them. You are
939987 [6798] too self-willed.â€
939987 [6799] 
939987 [6800] â€œSheâ€™s a tigress!â€ yelled Katerina Ivanovna. â€œWhy did you hold me, Alexey
939987 [6801] Fyodorovitch? Iâ€™d have beaten herâ€”beaten her!â€
939987 [6802] 
939987 [6803] She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care to,
939987 [6804] indeed.
939987 [6805] 
939987 [6806] â€œShe ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!â€
939987 [6807] 
939987 [6808] Alyosha withdrew towards the door.
939987 [6809] 
939987 [6810] â€œBut, my God!â€ cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. â€œHe! He! He
939987 [6811] could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature what
939987 [6812] happened on that fatal, accursed day! â€˜You brought your beauty for sale,
939987 [6813] dear young lady.â€™ She knows it! Your brotherâ€™s a scoundrel, Alexey
939987 [6814] Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [6815] 
939987 [6816] Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldnâ€™t find a word. His heart
939987 [6817] ached.
939987 [6818] 
939987 [6819] â€œGo away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Itâ€™s shameful, itâ€™s awful for me!
939987 [6820] To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Donâ€™t condemn me.
939987 [6821] Forgive me. I donâ€™t know what I shall do with myself now!â€
939987 [6822] 
939987 [6823] Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she did.
939987 [6824] Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
939987 [6825] 
939987 [6826] â€œThe young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; itâ€™s
939987 [6827] been left with us since dinner-time.â€
939987 [6828] 
939987 [6829] Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost
939987 [6830] unconsciously, into his pocket.
939987 [6831] 
939987 [6832] 
939987 [6833] 
939987 [6834] Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined
939987 [6835] 
939987 [6836] 
939987 [6837] It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the
939987 [6838] monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.
939987 [6839] It was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces
939987 [6840] ahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under a
939987 [6841] solitary willow at the cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the
939987 [6842] cross-roads the figure moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:
939987 [6843] 
939987 [6844] â€œYour money or your life!â€
939987 [6845] 
939987 [6846] â€œSo itâ€™s you, Mitya,â€ cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled
939987 [6847] however.
939987 [6848] 
939987 [6849] â€œHa ha ha! You didnâ€™t expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By her
939987 [6850] house? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At last
939987 [6851] I thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here, thereâ€™s no other way
939987 [6852] to the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But
939987 [6853] whatâ€™s the matter?â€
939987 [6854] 
939987 [6855] â€œNothing, brotherâ€”itâ€™s the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Fatherâ€™s blood
939987 [6856] just now.â€ (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of tears for a
939987 [6857] long time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.) â€œYou almost
939987 [6858] killed himâ€”cursed himâ€”and nowâ€”hereâ€”youâ€™re making jokesâ€”â€˜Your money or your
939987 [6859] life!â€™ â€
939987 [6860] 
939987 [6861] â€œWell, what of that? Itâ€™s not seemlyâ€”is that it? Not suitable in my
939987 [6862] position?â€
939987 [6863] 
939987 [6864] â€œNoâ€”I onlyâ€”â€
939987 [6865] 
939987 [6866] â€œStay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what a
939987 [6867] wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as Godâ€™s
939987 [6868] above, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is there
939987 [6869] to wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist
939987 [6870] them into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdening
939987 [6871] the earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then I heard you
939987 [6872] comingâ€”Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So
939987 [6873] there is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little
939987 [6874] brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I love
939987 [6875] in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment that I
939987 [6876] thought, â€˜Iâ€™ll fall on his neck at once.â€™ Then a stupid idea struck me, to
939987 [6877] have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a fool, â€˜Your money!â€™
939987 [6878] Forgive my fooleryâ€”it was only nonsense, and thereâ€™s nothing unseemly in
939987 [6879] my soul.... Damn it all, tell me whatâ€™s happened. What did she say? Strike
939987 [6880] me, crush me, donâ€™t spare me! Was she furious?â€
939987 [6881] 
939987 [6882] â€œNo, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. Thereâ€”I found them
939987 [6883] both there.â€
939987 [6884] 
939987 [6885] â€œBoth? Whom?â€
939987 [6886] 
939987 [6887] â€œGrushenka at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s.â€
939987 [6888] 
939987 [6889] Dmitri was struck dumb.
939987 [6890] 
939987 [6891] â€œImpossible!â€ he cried. â€œYouâ€™re raving! Grushenka with her?â€
939987 [6892] 
939987 [6893] Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to
939987 [6894] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s. He was ten minutes telling his story. He canâ€™t be
939987 [6895] said to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make it
939987 [6896] clear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly
939987 [6897] describing, often in one word, his own sensations. Dmitri listened in
939987 [6898] silence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to
939987 [6899] Alyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as the
939987 [6900] story went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He
939987 [6901] scowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more
939987 [6902] rigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible
939987 [6903] rapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips
939987 [6904] parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous
939987 [6905] laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he could not
939987 [6906] speak.
939987 [6907] 
939987 [6908] â€œSo she wouldnâ€™t kiss her hand! So she didnâ€™t kiss it; so she ran away!â€
939987 [6909] he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might have
939987 [6910] been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. â€œSo the other one called
939987 [6911] her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be flogged on a
939987 [6912] scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. Thatâ€™s just what I think; she ought to
939987 [6913] have been long ago. Itâ€™s like this, brother, let her be punished, but I
939987 [6914] must get better first. I understand the queen of impudence. Thatâ€™s her all
939987 [6915] over! You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! Sheâ€™s
939987 [6916] magnificent in her own line! So she ran home? Iâ€™ll goâ€”ahâ€”Iâ€™ll run to her!
939987 [6917] Alyosha, donâ€™t blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.â€
939987 [6918] 
939987 [6919] â€œBut Katerina Ivanovna!â€ exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
939987 [6920] 
939987 [6921] â€œI see her, too! I see right through her, as Iâ€™ve never done before! Itâ€™s
939987 [6922] a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is, of the
939987 [6923] five! What a thing to do! Thatâ€™s just like Katya, who was not afraid to
939987 [6924] face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generous
939987 [6925] impulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness, the defiance
939987 [6926] of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? That
939987 [6927] aunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. Sheâ€™s the sister of the generalâ€™s
939987 [6928] widow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband was
939987 [6929] caught stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all,
939987 [6930] and the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasnâ€™t raised them since.
939987 [6931] So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldnâ€™t listen to her! She thinks
939987 [6932] she can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She
939987 [6933] thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it
939987 [6934] herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think
939987 [6935] she kissed Grushenkaâ€™s hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she
939987 [6936] really was fascinated by Grushenka, thatâ€™s to say, not by Grushenka, but
939987 [6937] by her own dream, her own delusionâ€”because it was _her_ dream, _her_
939987 [6938] delusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did
939987 [6939] you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!â€
939987 [6940] 
939987 [6941] â€œBrother, you donâ€™t seem to have noticed how youâ€™ve insulted Katerina
939987 [6942] Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face
939987 [6943] just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty!
939987 [6944] Brother, what could be worse than that insult?â€
939987 [6945] 
939987 [6946] What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed,
939987 [6947] his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s humiliation.
939987 [6948] 
939987 [6949] â€œBah!â€ Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. He
939987 [6950] only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, and
939987 [6951] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s cry: â€œYour brother is a scoundrel!â€
939987 [6952] 
939987 [6953] â€œYes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that â€˜fatal day,â€™ as
939987 [6954] Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at
939987 [6955] Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I was
939987 [6956] sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katyaâ€™s image, and Grushenka
939987 [6957] understood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she cried
939987 [6958] herself.... Damn it all! But itâ€™s bound to be so now.... Then she cried,
939987 [6959] but now â€˜the dagger in the heartâ€™! Thatâ€™s how women are.â€
939987 [6960] 
939987 [6961] He looked down and sank into thought.
939987 [6962] 
939987 [6963] â€œYes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!â€ he said suddenly, in a
939987 [6964] gloomy voice. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter whether I cried or not, Iâ€™m a scoundrel!
939987 [6965] Tell her I accept the name, if thatâ€™s any comfort. Come, thatâ€™s enough.
939987 [6966] Good-by. Itâ€™s no use talking! Itâ€™s not amusing. You go your way and I
939987 [6967] mine. And I donâ€™t want to see you again except as a last resource.
939987 [6968] Good-by, Alexey!â€
939987 [6969] 
939987 [6970] He warmly pressed Alyoshaâ€™s hand, and still looking down, without raising
939987 [6971] his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.
939987 [6972] 
939987 [6973] Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so abruptly.
939987 [6974] 
939987 [6975] â€œStay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!â€ cried Dmitri, suddenly
939987 [6976] turning back. â€œLook at me. Look at me well. You see here, hereâ€”thereâ€™s
939987 [6977] terrible disgrace in store for me.â€ (As he said â€œhere,â€ Dmitri struck his
939987 [6978] chest with his fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor lay
939987 [6979] precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging
939987 [6980] round his neck.) â€œYou know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but
939987 [6981] let me tell you that Iâ€™ve never done anything before and never shall
939987 [6982] again, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which I
939987 [6983] bear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to
939987 [6984] pass, though Iâ€™m perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it
939987 [6985] through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I
939987 [6986] shanâ€™t stop it. I told you everything just now, but I didnâ€™t tell you
939987 [6987] this, because even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if
939987 [6988] I do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I
939987 [6989] shanâ€™t pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witness
939987 [6990] that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need to
939987 [6991] explain. Youâ€™ll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and the
939987 [6992] she-devil. Good-by. Donâ€™t pray for me, Iâ€™m not worth it. And thereâ€™s no
939987 [6993] need, no need at all.... I donâ€™t need it! Away!â€
939987 [6994] 
939987 [6995] And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the
939987 [6996] monastery.
939987 [6997] 
939987 [6998] â€œWhat? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?â€ he wondered
939987 [6999] wildly. â€œWhy, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall look him up. I
939987 [7000] shall make a point of it. What does he mean?â€
939987 [7001] 
939987 [7002]                   -------------------------------------
939987 [7003] 
939987 [7004] He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage.
939987 [7005] The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at that hour. There
939987 [7006] was a tremor in his heart as he went into Father Zossimaâ€™s cell.
939987 [7007] 
939987 [7008] â€œWhy, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here was
939987 [7009] peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was darkness in
939987 [7010] which one lost oneâ€™s way and went astray at once....â€
939987 [7011] 
939987 [7012] In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father PaÃ¯ssy, who came every
939987 [7013] hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm that he
939987 [7014] was getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the brothers
939987 [7015] could not take place that day. As a rule every evening after service the
939987 [7016] monks flocked into Father Zossimaâ€™s cell, and all confessed aloud their
939987 [7017] sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their
939987 [7018] disputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder
939987 [7019] absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed
939987 [7020] them. It was against this general â€œconfessionâ€ that the opponents of
939987 [7021] â€œeldersâ€ protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament
939987 [7022] of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different
939987 [7023] thing. They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such
939987 [7024] confessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led to
939987 [7025] sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, and
939987 [7026] went against their own will because every one went, and for fear they
939987 [7027] should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some of
939987 [7028] the monks agreed beforehand, saying, â€œIâ€™ll confess I lost my temper with
939987 [7029] you this morning, and you confirm it,â€ simply in order to have something
939987 [7030] to say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too,
939987 [7031] that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that
939987 [7032] letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened
939987 [7033] and read by him before those to whom they were addressed.
939987 [7034] 
939987 [7035] It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good
939987 [7036] faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact,
939987 [7037] there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and
939987 [7038] strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks
939987 [7039] adhered to their opinion, arguing that â€œfor those who have come within
939987 [7040] these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will
939987 [7041] certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who
939987 [7042] find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in
939987 [7043] entering the monasteryâ€”their proper place is in the world. Even in the
939987 [7044] temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no good taking
939987 [7045] it too much into account.â€
939987 [7046] 
939987 [7047] â€œHe is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy whispered to
939987 [7048] Alyosha, as he blessed him. â€œItâ€™s difficult to rouse him. And he must not
939987 [7049] be roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to the
939987 [7050] brothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to take
939987 [7051] the sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He asked
939987 [7052] whether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the town. â€˜I
939987 [7053] blessed him for that work,â€™ he said, â€˜his place is there, not here, for
939987 [7054] awhile.â€™ Those were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with
939987 [7055] anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it that he has
939987 [7056] decided that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseen
939987 [7057] something in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return to the
939987 [7058] world, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not for
939987 [7059] frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.â€
939987 [7060] 
939987 [7061] Father PaÃ¯ssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was
939987 [7062] dying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly and
939987 [7063] ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, the
939987 [7064] Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery next
939987 [7065] day, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed with
939987 [7066] love, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one
939987 [7067] instant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed,
939987 [7068] and whom he honored above every one in the world. He went into Father
939987 [7069] Zossimaâ€™s bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder,
939987 [7070] who slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing
939987 [7071] and a peaceful face.
939987 [7072] 
939987 [7073] Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received his
939987 [7074] guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the hard,
939987 [7075] narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing nothing
939987 [7076] but a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted to him that
939987 [7077] morning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his cassock, which
939987 [7078] he used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell on his knees and
939987 [7079] prayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to
939987 [7080] lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which
939987 [7081] always visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which his
939987 [7082] evening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him light
939987 [7083] untroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the
939987 [7084] little pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina
939987 [7085] Ivanovnaâ€™s. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some
939987 [7086] hesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by
939987 [7087] Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him before
939987 [7088] the elder in the morning.
939987 [7089] 
939987 [7090] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch,â€ she wrote, â€œI am writing to you without any oneâ€™s
939987 [7091] knowledge, even mammaâ€™s, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot live
939987 [7092] without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and this
939987 [7093] no one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want so
939987 [7094] much to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you itâ€™s
939987 [7095] not true and that itâ€™s blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha,
939987 [7096] I love you, Iâ€™ve loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when
939987 [7097] you were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my
939987 [7098] life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together
939987 [7099] till our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the
939987 [7100] monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. By
939987 [7101] that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking and
939987 [7102] dancing. There can be no doubt of that.
939987 [7103] 
939987 [7104] â€œYou see how Iâ€™ve thought of everything. Thereâ€™s only one thing I canâ€™t
939987 [7105] imagine: what youâ€™ll think of me when you read this. Iâ€™m always laughing
939987 [7106] and being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure you before
939987 [7107] I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and now
939987 [7108] Iâ€™m praying, and almost crying.
939987 [7109] 
939987 [7110] â€œMy secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I donâ€™t know how I
939987 [7111] shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I canâ€™t restrain
939987 [7112] myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day. Youâ€™ll
939987 [7113] think Iâ€™m a nasty girl making fun of you, and you wonâ€™t believe my letter.
939987 [7114] And so I beg you, dear one, if youâ€™ve any pity for me, when you come
939987 [7115] to-morrow, donâ€™t look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it
939987 [7116] will be sure to make me laugh, especially as youâ€™ll be in that long gown.
939987 [7117] I feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, donâ€™t look at
939987 [7118] me at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....
939987 [7119] 
939987 [7120] â€œHere Iâ€™ve written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha,
939987 [7121] donâ€™t despise me, and if Iâ€™ve done something very horrid and wounded you,
939987 [7122] forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is
939987 [7123] in your hands.
939987 [7124] 
939987 [7125] â€œI shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our _awful_
939987 [7126] meeting.â€”LISE.
939987 [7127] 
939987 [7128] â€œP.S.â€”Alyosha! You must, must, must come!â€”LISE.â€
939987 [7129] 
939987 [7130] Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought a
939987 [7131] little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That laugh
939987 [7132] seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as softly
939987 [7133] and happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himself
939987 [7134] and lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at once. â€œGod, have mercy
939987 [7135] upon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy
939987 [7136] keeping, and set them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them
939987 [7137] according to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!â€
939987 [7138] Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.

939987 [7152] 
939987 [7153] Chapter I. Father Ferapont
939987 [7154] 
939987 [7155] 
939987 [7156] Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up feeling
939987 [7157] very weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair. His
939987 [7158] mind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright and almost
939987 [7159] joyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality. â€œMaybe I
939987 [7160] shall not live through the coming day,â€ he said to Alyosha. Then he
939987 [7161] desired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to
939987 [7162] Father PaÃ¯ssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction
939987 [7163] followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the
939987 [7164] inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began coming
939987 [7165] from the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kiss
939987 [7166] and take leave of every one. As the cell was so small the earlier visitors
939987 [7167] withdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was
939987 [7168] seated again in his arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his
939987 [7169] voice was weak, it was fairly steady.
939987 [7170] 
939987 [7171] â€œIâ€™ve been teaching you so many years, and therefore Iâ€™ve been talking
939987 [7172] aloud so many years, that Iâ€™ve got into the habit of talking, and so much
939987 [7173] so that itâ€™s almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk,
939987 [7174] even now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,â€ he jested,
939987 [7175] looking with emotion at the group round him.
939987 [7176] 
939987 [7177] Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. But
939987 [7178] though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his speech
939987 [7179] was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he seemed anxious
939987 [7180] before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life,
939987 [7181] and not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirsting
939987 [7182] to share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more
939987 [7183] in his life to open his whole heart.
939987 [7184] 
939987 [7185] â€œLove one another, Fathers,â€ said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could
939987 [7186] remember afterwards. â€œLove Godâ€™s people. Because we have come here and
939987 [7187] shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are
939987 [7188] outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of
939987 [7189] us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on
939987 [7190] earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly
939987 [7191] he must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here.
939987 [7192] When he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is
939987 [7193] responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins,
939987 [7194] national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained.
939987 [7195] For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for
939987 [7196] all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness
939987 [7197] of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual
939987 [7198] man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man.
939987 [7199] For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to
939987 [7200] be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite,
939987 [7201] universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power
939987 [7202] to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world
939987 [7203] with your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess
939987 [7204] your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when
939987 [7205] perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with
939987 [7206] God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the
939987 [7207] great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and
939987 [7208] slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the
939987 [7209] materialistsâ€”and I mean not only the good onesâ€”for there are many good
939987 [7210] ones among them, especially in our dayâ€”hate not even the wicked ones.
939987 [7211] Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none
939987 [7212] to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not
939987 [7213] in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....
939987 [7214] Love Godâ€™s people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if you
939987 [7215] slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in
939987 [7216] covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock.
939987 [7217] Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate....
939987 [7218] Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to
939987 [7219] the banner and raise it on high.â€
939987 [7220] 
939987 [7221] But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his words
939987 [7222] afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take breath,
939987 [7223] and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They heard him
939987 [7224] with emotion, though many wondered at his words and found them obscure....
939987 [7225] Afterwards all remembered those words.
939987 [7226] 
939987 [7227] When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by the
939987 [7228] general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it.
939987 [7229] This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout
939987 [7230] solemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately
939987 [7231] after the elderâ€™s death. Their suspense was, from one point of view,
939987 [7232] almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by
939987 [7233] it. Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s face looked the gravest of all.
939987 [7234] 
939987 [7235] Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had
939987 [7236] arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. In
939987 [7237] it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It
939987 [7238] appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive
939987 [7239] Father Zossimaâ€™s blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a
939987 [7240] sergeantâ€™s widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might
939987 [7241] pray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to
939987 [7242] Irkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima
939987 [7243] had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for
939987 [7244] the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards
939987 [7245] forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, â€œas though reading the
939987 [7246] book of the futureâ€ (this was Madame Hohlakovâ€™s expression), words of
939987 [7247] comfort: â€œthat her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come
939987 [7248] himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and
939987 [7249] expect him.â€ And â€œWould you believe it?â€ exclaimed Madame Hohlakov
939987 [7250] enthusiastically, â€œthe prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and
939987 [7251] more than that.â€ Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave
939987 [7252] her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not
939987 [7253] all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya
939987 [7254] informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and
939987 [7255] that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped â€œto embrace his
939987 [7256] mother.â€
939987 [7257] 
939987 [7258] Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new â€œmiracle of
939987 [7259] predictionâ€ to the Superior and all the brotherhood. â€œAll, all, ought to
939987 [7260] know of it!â€ she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the
939987 [7261] excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had
939987 [7262] no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had
939987 [7263] commissioned the monk who brought his message â€œto inform most respectfully
939987 [7264] his reverence Father PaÃ¯ssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of
939987 [7265] with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and
939987 [7266] humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.â€ As the monk had given the
939987 [7267] message to Father PaÃ¯ssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after
939987 [7268] reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to
939987 [7269] Father PaÃ¯ssy in confirmation of the story.
939987 [7270] 
939987 [7271] And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read the
939987 [7272] news of the â€œmiracle,â€ could not completely restrain some inner emotion.
939987 [7273] His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips.
939987 [7274] 
939987 [7275] â€œWe shall see greater things!â€ broke from him.
939987 [7276] 
939987 [7277] â€œWe shall see greater things, greater things yet!â€ the monks around
939987 [7278] repeated.
939987 [7279] 
939987 [7280] But Father PaÃ¯ssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a
939987 [7281] time, not to speak of the matter â€œtill it be more fully confirmed, seeing
939987 [7282] there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this
939987 [7283] might well have chanced naturally,â€ he added, prudently, as it were to
939987 [7284] satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, a
939987 [7285] fact his listeners very clearly perceived.
939987 [7286] 
939987 [7287] Within the hour the â€œmiracleâ€ was of course known to the whole monastery,
939987 [7288] and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressed
939987 [7289] by it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from
939987 [7290] the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had been
939987 [7291] standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father
939987 [7292] Zossima earnestly, referring to the â€œhealingâ€ of the ladyâ€™s daughter, â€œHow
939987 [7293] can you presume to do such things?â€
939987 [7294] 
939987 [7295] He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The evening
939987 [7296] before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind the
939987 [7297] apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit. This
939987 [7298] Father Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing
939987 [7299] silence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima
939987 [7300] and the whole institution of â€œelders,â€ which he regarded as a pernicious
939987 [7301] and frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although from
939987 [7302] his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made him
939987 [7303] formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling, and many
939987 [7304] of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic, although
939987 [7305] they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was just his craziness
939987 [7306] attracted them.
939987 [7307] 
939987 [7308] Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in the
939987 [7309] hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this too
939987 [7310] because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy-five or more,
939987 [7311] and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell
939987 [7312] which had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, who
939987 [7313] had lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings many
939987 [7314] curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
939987 [7315] 
939987 [7316] Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same
939987 [7317] solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasantâ€™s hut,
939987 [7318] though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary number
939987 [7319] of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before themâ€”which men brought to
939987 [7320] the monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed to
939987 [7321] look after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was
939987 [7322] true) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper,
939987 [7323] who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three
939987 [7324] days, and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely
939987 [7325] uttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament
939987 [7326] bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the Father
939987 [7327] Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug was changed
939987 [7328] every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homage
939987 [7329] saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round.
939987 [7330] If he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always
939987 [7331] rude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but for
939987 [7332] the most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete
939987 [7333] riddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in
939987 [7334] explanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange
939987 [7335] belief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had
939987 [7336] communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and
939987 [7337] so was silent with men.
939987 [7338] 
939987 [7339] The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the
939987 [7340] beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corner
939987 [7341] where Father Ferapontâ€™s cell stood. â€œMaybe he will speak as you are a
939987 [7342] stranger and maybe youâ€™ll get nothing out of him,â€ the beekeeper had
939987 [7343] warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the utmost
939987 [7344] apprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was
939987 [7345] sitting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightly
939987 [7346] rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monk
939987 [7347] from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing.
939987 [7348] 
939987 [7349] â€œDo you want me to bow down to you, monk?â€ said Father Ferapont. â€œGet up!â€
939987 [7350] 
939987 [7351] The monk got up.
939987 [7352] 
939987 [7353] â€œBlessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?â€
939987 [7354] 
939987 [7355] What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict
939987 [7356] fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man. He
939987 [7357] was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face.
939987 [7358] There was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of athletic
939987 [7359] build. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray, and still had
939987 [7360] very thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His
939987 [7361] eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke
939987 [7362] with a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasantâ€™s long reddish coat of
939987 [7363] coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round
939987 [7364] his waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of
939987 [7365] the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changed
939987 [7366] for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty pounds under his
939987 [7367] coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to
939987 [7368] pieces.
939987 [7369] 
939987 [7370] â€œFrom the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,â€ the monk answered
939987 [7371] humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyes
939987 [7372] kept watch on the hermit.
939987 [7373] 
939987 [7374] â€œI have been at your Sylvesterâ€™s. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester
939987 [7375] well?â€
939987 [7376] 
939987 [7377] The monk hesitated.
939987 [7378] 
939987 [7379] â€œYou are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?â€
939987 [7380] 
939987 [7381] â€œOur dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lent
939987 [7382] there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesday
939987 [7383] and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries,
939987 [7384] or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white cabbage soup,
939987 [7385] noodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried
939987 [7386] fish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening,
939987 [7387] six whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and
939987 [7388] water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the
939987 [7389] same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing is
939987 [7390] eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three oâ€™clock,
939987 [7391] and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine. On
939987 [7392] Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not
939987 [7393] cooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy
939987 [7394] Thursday: â€˜It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to
939987 [7395] dishonor the whole of Lent!â€™ This is how we keep the fast. But what is
939987 [7396] that compared with you, holy Father,â€ added the monk, growing more
939987 [7397] confident, â€œfor all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but
939987 [7398] bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven.
939987 [7399] Itâ€™s truly marvelousâ€”your great abstinence.â€
939987 [7400] 
939987 [7401] â€œAnd mushrooms?â€ asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
939987 [7402] 
939987 [7403] â€œMushrooms?â€ repeated the surprised monk.
939987 [7404] 
939987 [7405] â€œYes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away into
939987 [7406] the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they canâ€™t
939987 [7407] give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil.
939987 [7408] Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting. Haughty and
939987 [7409] unclean is their judgment.â€
939987 [7410] 
939987 [7411] â€œOch, true,â€ sighed the monk.
939987 [7412] 
939987 [7413] â€œAnd have you seen devils among them?â€ asked Ferapont.
939987 [7414] 
939987 [7415] â€œAmong them? Among whom?â€ asked the monk, timidly.
939987 [7416] 
939987 [7417] â€œI went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I havenâ€™t been
939987 [7418] since. I saw a devil sitting on one manâ€™s chest hiding under his cassock,
939987 [7419] only his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his pocket with
939987 [7420] such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean belly
939987 [7421] of one, another was hanging round a manâ€™s neck, and so he was carrying him
939987 [7422] about without seeing him.â€
939987 [7423] 
939987 [7424] â€œYouâ€”can see spirits?â€ the monk inquired.
939987 [7425] 
939987 [7426] â€œI tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out from
939987 [7427] the Superiorâ€™s I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, a
939987 [7428] yard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip of
939987 [7429] his tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the
939987 [7430] door, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to struggle, and I
939987 [7431] made the sign of the cross over him three times. And he died on the spot
939987 [7432] like a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be
939987 [7433] stinking, but they donâ€™t see, they donâ€™t smell it. Itâ€™s a year since I
939987 [7434] have been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.â€
939987 [7435] 
939987 [7436] â€œYour words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,â€ said the monk,
939987 [7437] growing bolder and bolder, â€œis it true, as they noise abroad even to
939987 [7438] distant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with the
939987 [7439] Holy Ghost?â€
939987 [7440] 
939987 [7441] â€œHe does fly down at times.â€
939987 [7442] 
939987 [7443] â€œHow does he fly down? In what form?â€
939987 [7444] 
939987 [7445] â€œAs a bird.â€
939987 [7446] 
939987 [7447] â€œThe Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?â€
939987 [7448] 
939987 [7449] â€œThereâ€™s the Holy Ghost and thereâ€™s the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can
939987 [7450] appear as other birdsâ€”sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch and
939987 [7451] sometimes as a blue-tit.â€
939987 [7452] 
939987 [7453] â€œHow do you know him from an ordinary tit?â€
939987 [7454] 
939987 [7455] â€œHe speaks.â€
939987 [7456] 
939987 [7457] â€œHow does he speak, in what language?â€
939987 [7458] 
939987 [7459] â€œHuman language.â€
939987 [7460] 
939987 [7461] â€œAnd what does he tell you?â€
939987 [7462] 
939987 [7463] â€œWhy, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me
939987 [7464] unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.â€
939987 [7465] 
939987 [7466] â€œTerrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,â€ the monk shook
939987 [7467] his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.
939987 [7468] 
939987 [7469] â€œDo you see this tree?â€ asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
939987 [7470] 
939987 [7471] â€œI do, blessed Father.â€
939987 [7472] 
939987 [7473] â€œYou think itâ€™s an elm, but for me it has another shape.â€
939987 [7474] 
939987 [7475] â€œWhat sort of shape?â€ inquired the monk, after a pause of vain
939987 [7476] expectation.
939987 [7477] 
939987 [7478] â€œIt happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it is
939987 [7479] Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see it
939987 [7480] clearly and tremble. Itâ€™s terrible, terrible!â€
939987 [7481] 
939987 [7482] â€œWhat is there terrible if itâ€™s Christ Himself?â€
939987 [7483] 
939987 [7484] â€œWhy, Heâ€™ll snatch me up and carry me away.â€
939987 [7485] 
939987 [7486] â€œAlive?â€
939987 [7487] 
939987 [7488] â€œIn the spirit and glory of Elijah, havenâ€™t you heard? He will take me in
939987 [7489] His arms and bear me away.â€
939987 [7490] 
939987 [7491] Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the
939987 [7492] brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at heart
939987 [7493] a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima. He was
939987 [7494] strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept so
939987 [7495] rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should â€œsee marvels.â€ His words seemed
939987 [7496] certainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words,
939987 [7497] and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have
939987 [7498] sacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the
939987 [7499] devilâ€™s tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the
939987 [7500] figurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
939987 [7501] prejudice against the institution of â€œelders,â€ which he only knew of by
939987 [7502] hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had been
939987 [7503] long at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of some
939987 [7504] shallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, a
939987 [7505] meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This was
939987 [7506] why the news of the fresh â€œmiracleâ€ performed by Father Zossima reduced
939987 [7507] him to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
939987 [7508] inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro
939987 [7509] from one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks
939987 [7510] that were crowding within and without the elderâ€™s cell. But he did not pay
939987 [7511] much attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards.
939987 [7512] 
939987 [7513] He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling
939987 [7514] tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closing
939987 [7515] his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was no one else in
939987 [7516] the cell but Father PaÃ¯ssy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The
939987 [7517] elder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him
939987 [7518] suddenly:
939987 [7519] 
939987 [7520] â€œAre your people expecting you, my son?â€
939987 [7521] 
939987 [7522] Alyosha hesitated.
939987 [7523] 
939987 [7524] â€œHavenâ€™t they need of you? Didnâ€™t you promise some one yesterday to see
939987 [7525] them to-day?â€
939987 [7526] 
939987 [7527] â€œI did promiseâ€”to my fatherâ€”my brothersâ€”others too.â€
939987 [7528] 
939987 [7529] â€œYou see, you must go. Donâ€™t grieve. Be sure I shall not die without your
939987 [7530] being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, it
939987 [7531] will be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love me. But
939987 [7532] now go to keep your promise.â€
939987 [7533] 
939987 [7534] Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise that
939987 [7535] he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last gift to
939987 [7536] him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He made haste
939987 [7537] that he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly.
939987 [7538] Father PaÃ¯ssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved and
939987 [7539] surprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell together.
939987 [7540] 
939987 [7541] â€œRemember, young man, unceasingly,â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy began, without preface,
939987 [7542] â€œthat the science of this world, which has become a great power, has,
939987 [7543] especially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down to
939987 [7544] us in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this world
939987 [7545] have nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have only
939987 [7546] analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is
939987 [7547] marvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the
939987 [7548] gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen
939987 [7549] centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul
939987 [7550] and in the masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the
939987 [7551] souls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who have
939987 [7552] renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow
939987 [7553] the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of
939987 [7554] their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue
939987 [7555] than the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the
939987 [7556] result has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young man, since
939987 [7557] you are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Maybe,
939987 [7558] remembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the
939987 [7559] heart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the
939987 [7560] world are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
939987 [7561] orphan.â€
939987 [7562] 
939987 [7563] With these words Father PaÃ¯ssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the monastery
939987 [7564] and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a new and
939987 [7565] unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who had
939987 [7566] hitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father Zossima had
939987 [7567] bequeathed him to him at his death, and â€œperhaps thatâ€™s just what had
939987 [7568] passed between them,â€ Alyosha thought suddenly. The philosophic
939987 [7569] reflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of
939987 [7570] Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s heart. He was in haste to arm the boyâ€™s mind for conflict
939987 [7571] with temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the
939987 [7572] strongest defense he could imagine.
939987 [7573] 
939987 [7574] 
939987 [7575] 
939987 [7576] Chapter II. At His Fatherâ€™s
939987 [7577] 
939987 [7578] 
939987 [7579] First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered that
939987 [7580] his father had insisted the day before that he should come without his
939987 [7581] brother Ivan seeing him. â€œWhy so?â€ Alyosha wondered suddenly. â€œEven if my
939987 [7582] father has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most
939987 [7583] likely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different,â€
939987 [7584] he decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the
939987 [7585] garden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
939987 [7586] told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two
939987 [7587] hours ago.
939987 [7588] 
939987 [7589] â€œAnd my father?â€
939987 [7590] 
939987 [7591] â€œHe is up, taking his coffee,â€ Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
939987 [7592] 
939987 [7593] Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing
939987 [7594] slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by looking
939987 [7595] through some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone in
939987 [7596] the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had got up
939987 [7597] early and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired and weak.
939987 [7598] His forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the
939987 [7599] night, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen
939987 [7600] terribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches,
939987 [7601] giving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old
939987 [7602] man was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he came
939987 [7603] in.
939987 [7604] 
939987 [7605] â€œThe coffee is cold,â€ he cried harshly; â€œI wonâ€™t offer you any. Iâ€™ve
939987 [7606] ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I donâ€™t invite any one
939987 [7607] to share it. Why have you come?â€
939987 [7608] 
939987 [7609] â€œTo find out how you are,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [7610] 
939987 [7611] â€œYes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. Itâ€™s all of no consequence.
939987 [7612] You need not have troubled. But I knew youâ€™d come poking in directly.â€
939987 [7613] 
939987 [7614] He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up and
939987 [7615] looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the fortieth time that
939987 [7616] morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red handkerchief more
939987 [7617] becomingly on his forehead.
939987 [7618] 
939987 [7619] â€œRedâ€™s better. Itâ€™s just like the hospital in a white one,â€ he observed
939987 [7620] sententiously. â€œWell, how are things over there? How is your elder?â€
939987 [7621] 
939987 [7622] â€œHe is very bad; he may die to-day,â€ answered Alyosha. But his father had
939987 [7623] not listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.
939987 [7624] 
939987 [7625] â€œIvanâ€™s gone out,â€ he said suddenly. â€œHe is doing his utmost to carry off
939987 [7626] Mityaâ€™s betrothed. Thatâ€™s what he is staying here for,â€ he added
939987 [7627] maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
939987 [7628] 
939987 [7629] â€œSurely he did not tell you so?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [7630] 
939987 [7631] â€œYes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks ago?
939987 [7632] You donâ€™t suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have had some
939987 [7633] object in coming.â€
939987 [7634] 
939987 [7635] â€œWhat do you mean? Why do you say such things?â€ said Alyosha, troubled.
939987 [7636] 
939987 [7637] â€œHe doesnâ€™t ask for money, itâ€™s true, but yet he wonâ€™t get a farthing from
939987 [7638] me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dear
939987 [7639] Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer I live,
939987 [7640] the more I shall need it,â€ he continued, pacing from one corner of the
939987 [7641] room to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy
939987 [7642] overcoat made of yellow cotton material. â€œI can still pass for a man at
939987 [7643] five and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As I
939987 [7644] get older, you know, I shanâ€™t be a pretty object. The wenches wonâ€™t come
939987 [7645] to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am saving up
939987 [7646] more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may
939987 [7647] as well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.
939987 [7648] For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do it
939987 [7649] on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall upon me for
939987 [7650] being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my
939987 [7651] taste, let me tell you that; and itâ€™s not the proper place for a
939987 [7652] gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleep
939987 [7653] and donâ€™t wake up again, and thatâ€™s all. You can pray for my soul if you
939987 [7654] like. And if you donâ€™t want to, donâ€™t, damn you! Thatâ€™s my philosophy.
939987 [7655] Ivan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a
939987 [7656] conceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learning ... nor education
939987 [7657] either. He sits silent and smiles at one without speakingâ€”thatâ€™s what
939987 [7658] pulls him through.â€
939987 [7659] 
939987 [7660] Alyosha listened to him in silence.
939987 [7661] 
939987 [7662] â€œWhy wonâ€™t he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your
939987 [7663] Ivan is a scoundrel! And Iâ€™ll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to.
939987 [7664] For if youâ€™ve money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing
939987 [7665] and you can have it. Thatâ€™s what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to
939987 [7666] prevent me getting married and thatâ€™s why he is egging on Mitya to marry
939987 [7667] Grushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I
939987 [7668] should leave him my money if I donâ€™t marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
939987 [7669] Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, thatâ€™s what heâ€™s
939987 [7670] reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!â€
939987 [7671] 
939987 [7672] â€œHow cross you are! Itâ€™s because of yesterday; you had better lie down,â€
939987 [7673] said Alyosha.
939987 [7674] 
939987 [7675] â€œThere! you say that,â€ the old man observed suddenly, as though it had
939987 [7676] struck him for the first time, â€œand I am not angry with you. But if Ivan
939987 [7677] said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have good
939987 [7678] moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.â€
939987 [7679] 
939987 [7680] â€œYou are not ill-natured, but distorted,â€ said Alyosha with a smile.
939987 [7681] 
939987 [7682] â€œListen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and I
939987 [7683] donâ€™t know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in these
939987 [7684] fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice, but
939987 [7685] even now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about by the
939987 [7686] hair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of murdering him
939987 [7687] outrightâ€”all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him
939987 [7688] and could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday.â€
939987 [7689] 
939987 [7690] â€œThen you donâ€™t mean to take proceedings?â€
939987 [7691] 
939987 [7692] â€œIvan has dissuaded me. I shouldnâ€™t care about Ivan, but thereâ€™s another
939987 [7693] thing.â€
939987 [7694] 
939987 [7695] And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
939987 [7696] 
939987 [7697] â€œIf I send the ruffian to prison, sheâ€™ll hear of it and run to see him at
939987 [7698] once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within an
939987 [7699] inch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For thatâ€™s her
939987 [7700] way, everything by contraries. I know her through and through! Wonâ€™t you
939987 [7701] have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and Iâ€™ll pour a quarter of a
939987 [7702] glass of brandy into it, itâ€™s delicious, my boy.â€
939987 [7703] 
939987 [7704] â€œNo, thank you. Iâ€™ll take that roll with me if I may,â€ said Alyosha, and
939987 [7705] taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock.
939987 [7706] â€œAnd youâ€™d better not have brandy, either,â€ he suggested apprehensively,
939987 [7707] looking into the old manâ€™s face.
939987 [7708] 
939987 [7709] â€œYou are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them.
939987 [7710] Only one little glass. Iâ€™ll get it out of the cupboard.â€
939987 [7711] 
939987 [7712] He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the
939987 [7713] cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
939987 [7714] 
939987 [7715] â€œThatâ€™s enough. One glass wonâ€™t kill me.â€
939987 [7716] 
939987 [7717] â€œYou see you are in a better humor now,â€ said Alyosha, smiling.
939987 [7718] 
939987 [7719] â€œUm! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a
939987 [7720] scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnyaâ€”why is that? He wants to spy
939987 [7721] how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels! But I
939987 [7722] donâ€™t recognize Ivan, I donâ€™t know him at all. Where does he come from? He
939987 [7723] is not one of us in soul. As though Iâ€™d leave him anything! I shanâ€™t leave
939987 [7724] a will at all, you may as well know. And Iâ€™ll crush Mitya like a beetle. I
939987 [7725] squash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread
939987 [7726] on them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_ Mitya, for you love him.
939987 [7727] Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan
939987 [7728] loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan loves
939987 [7729] nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.
939987 [7730] They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will be
939987 [7731] gone.... I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; I
939987 [7732] wanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a
939987 [7733] thousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
939987 [7734] off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
939987 [7735] Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?â€
939987 [7736] 
939987 [7737] â€œIâ€”Iâ€™ll ask him,â€ muttered Alyosha. â€œIf you would give him three thousand,
939987 [7738] perhaps heâ€”â€
939987 [7739] 
939987 [7740] â€œThatâ€™s nonsense! You neednâ€™t ask him now, no need! Iâ€™ve changed my mind.
939987 [7741] It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I wonâ€™t give him anything, not a penny,
939987 [7742] I want my money myself,â€ cried the old man, waving his hand. â€œIâ€™ll crush
939987 [7743] him like a beetle without it. Donâ€™t say anything to him or else he will
939987 [7744] begin hoping. Thereâ€™s nothing for you to do here, you neednâ€™t stay. Is
939987 [7745] that betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully
939987 [7746] hidden from me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see
939987 [7747] her yesterday, I believe?â€
939987 [7748] 
939987 [7749] â€œNothing will induce her to abandon him.â€
939987 [7750] 
939987 [7751] â€œThere you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and a
939987 [7752] scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies,
939987 [7753] very different fromâ€”Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then (for I
939987 [7754] was better-looking than he at eight and twenty) Iâ€™d have been a conquering
939987 [7755] hero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shanâ€™t have Grushenka, anyway,
939987 [7756] he shanâ€™t! Iâ€™ll crush him!â€
939987 [7757] 
939987 [7758] His anger had returned with the last words.
939987 [7759] 
939987 [7760] â€œYou can go. Thereâ€™s nothing for you to do here to-day,â€ he snapped
939987 [7761] harshly.
939987 [7762] 
939987 [7763] Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.
939987 [7764] 
939987 [7765] â€œWhatâ€™s that for?â€ The old man was a little surprised. â€œWe shall see each
939987 [7766] other again, or do you think we shanâ€™t?â€
939987 [7767] 
939987 [7768] â€œNot at all, I didnâ€™t mean anything.â€
939987 [7769] 
939987 [7770] â€œNor did I, I did not mean anything,â€ said the old man, looking at him.
939987 [7771] â€œListen, listen,â€ he shouted after him, â€œmake haste and come again and
939987 [7772] Iâ€™ll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to-day. Be sure to
939987 [7773] come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!â€
939987 [7774] 
939987 [7775] And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the cupboard
939987 [7776] again and poured out another half-glass.
939987 [7777] 
939987 [7778] â€œI wonâ€™t have more!â€ he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he locked
939987 [7779] the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into his bedroom,
939987 [7780] lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep.
939987 [7781]

939987 [7783] 
939987 [7784] Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys
939987 [7785] 
939987 [7786] 
939987 [7787] â€œThank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,â€ thought Alyosha, as he
939987 [7788] left his fatherâ€™s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakovâ€™s, â€œor I might
939987 [7789] have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.â€
939987 [7790] 
939987 [7791] Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed
939987 [7792] their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. â€œFather is
939987 [7793] spiteful and angry, heâ€™s made some plan and will stick to it. And what of
939987 [7794] Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and
939987 [7795] angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in
939987 [7796] finding him to-day, whatever happens.â€
939987 [7797] 
939987 [7798] But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road,
939987 [7799] which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on
939987 [7800] him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out
939987 [7801] into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High
939987 [7802] Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of
939987 [7803] schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were
939987 [7804] going home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others
939987 [7805] with leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
939987 [7806] little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round the
939987 [7807] ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The whole
939987 [7808] group was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council.
939987 [7809] Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children without
939987 [7810] taking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of children
939987 [7811] of three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so,
939987 [7812] anxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them.
939987 [7813] He looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the
939987 [7814] boys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
939987 [7815] there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a satchel at
939987 [7816] his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and with
939987 [7817] sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other
939987 [7818] six, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school,
939987 [7819] but with whom he had evidently had a feud.
939987 [7820] 
939987 [7821] Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a black
939987 [7822] jacket, observed:
939987 [7823] 
939987 [7824] â€œWhen I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on my
939987 [7825] left side, so as to have my right hand free, but youâ€™ve got yours on your
939987 [7826] right side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.â€
939987 [7827] 
939987 [7828] Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
939987 [7829] remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once into
939987 [7830] confidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of
939987 [7831] children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on a
939987 [7832] perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.
939987 [7833] 
939987 [7834] â€œBut he is left-handed,â€ another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven,
939987 [7835] answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
939987 [7836] 
939987 [7837] â€œHe even throws stones with his left hand,â€ observed a third.
939987 [7838] 
939987 [7839] At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the
939987 [7840] left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy
939987 [7841] standing the other side of the ditch.
939987 [7842] 
939987 [7843] â€œGive it him, hit him back, Smurov,â€ they all shouted. But Smurov, the
939987 [7844] left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threw
939987 [7845] a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other side
939987 [7846] of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones,
939987 [7847] flung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha
939987 [7848] and hit him painfully on the shoulder.
939987 [7849] 
939987 [7850] â€œHe aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!â€
939987 [7851] the boys shouted, laughing. â€œCome, all throw at him at once!â€ and six
939987 [7852] stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down,
939987 [7853] but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Both
939987 [7854] sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full
939987 [7855] too.
939987 [7856] 
939987 [7857] â€œWhat are you about! Arenâ€™t you ashamed? Six against one! Why, youâ€™ll kill
939987 [7858] him,â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [7859] 
939987 [7860] He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Three
939987 [7861] or four ceased throwing for a minute.
939987 [7862] 
939987 [7863] â€œHe began first!â€ cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice.
939987 [7864] â€œHe is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a
939987 [7865] penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldnâ€™t tell tales, but he must be
939987 [7866] thrashed.â€
939987 [7867] 
939987 [7868] â€œBut what for? I suppose you tease him.â€
939987 [7869] 
939987 [7870] â€œThere, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,â€ cried the
939987 [7871] children. â€œItâ€™s you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at
939987 [7872] him again, donâ€™t miss, Smurov!â€ and again a fire of stones, and a very
939987 [7873] vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the
939987 [7874] chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky
939987 [7875] Street. They all shouted: â€œAha, he is funking, he is running away. Wisp of
939987 [7876] tow!â€
939987 [7877] 
939987 [7878] â€œYou donâ€™t know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good for
939987 [7879] him,â€ said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be the
939987 [7880] eldest.
939987 [7881] 
939987 [7882] â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with him?â€ asked Alyosha, â€œis he a tell-tale or what?â€
939987 [7883] 
939987 [7884] The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
939987 [7885] 
939987 [7886] â€œAre you going that way, to Mihailovsky?â€ the same boy went on. â€œCatch him
939987 [7887] up.... You see heâ€™s stopped again, he is waiting and looking at you.â€
939987 [7888] 
939987 [7889] â€œHe is looking at you,â€ the other boys chimed in.
939987 [7890] 
939987 [7891] â€œYou ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask him
939987 [7892] that!â€
939987 [7893] 
939987 [7894] There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they at
939987 [7895] him.
939987 [7896] 
939987 [7897] â€œDonâ€™t go near him, heâ€™ll hurt you,â€ cried Smurov in a warning voice.
939987 [7898] 
939987 [7899] â€œI shanâ€™t ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him with
939987 [7900] that question somehow. But Iâ€™ll find out from him why you hate him so.â€
939987 [7901] 
939987 [7902] â€œFind out then, find out,â€ cried the boys, laughing.
939987 [7903] 
939987 [7904] Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight
939987 [7905] towards the boy.
939987 [7906] 
939987 [7907] â€œYouâ€™d better look out,â€ the boys called after him; â€œhe wonâ€™t be afraid of
939987 [7908] you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did Krassotkin.â€
939987 [7909] 
939987 [7910] The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha saw
939987 [7911] facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weakly
939987 [7912] boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him
939987 [7913] vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had
939987 [7914] monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There
939987 [7915] was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot
939987 [7916] just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened
939987 [7917] with ink. Both the pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with
939987 [7918] stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at
939987 [7919] him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyoshaâ€™s eyes that he wouldnâ€™t beat
939987 [7920] him, became less defiant, and addressed him first.
939987 [7921] 
939987 [7922] â€œI am alone, and there are six of them. Iâ€™ll beat them all, alone!â€ he
939987 [7923] said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
939987 [7924] 
939987 [7925] â€œI think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,â€ observed Alyosha.
939987 [7926] 
939987 [7927] â€œBut I hit Smurov on the head!â€ cried the boy.
939987 [7928] 
939987 [7929] â€œThey told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on
939987 [7930] purpose,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [7931] 
939987 [7932] The boy looked darkly at him.
939987 [7933] 
939987 [7934] â€œI donâ€™t know you. Do you know me?â€ Alyosha continued.
939987 [7935] 
939987 [7936] â€œLet me alone!â€ the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though he
939987 [7937] were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his
939987 [7938] eyes.
939987 [7939] 
939987 [7940] â€œVery well, I am going,â€ said Alyosha; â€œonly I donâ€™t know you and I donâ€™t
939987 [7941] tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I donâ€™t want to tease you.
939987 [7942] Good-by!â€
939987 [7943] 
939987 [7944] â€œMonk in silk trousers!â€ cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same
939987 [7945] vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude
939987 [7946] of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha
939987 [7947] turned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone three steps before
939987 [7948] the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the
939987 [7949] back.
939987 [7950] 
939987 [7951] â€œSo youâ€™ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say
939987 [7952] that you attack on the sly,â€ said Alyosha, turning round again. This time
939987 [7953] the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyoshaâ€™s face; but Alyosha just
939987 [7954] had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow.
939987 [7955] 
939987 [7956] â€œArenâ€™t you ashamed? What have I done to you?â€ he cried.
939987 [7957] 
939987 [7958] The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack
939987 [7959] him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild
939987 [7960] beastâ€™s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move,
939987 [7961] the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his
939987 [7962] middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he
939987 [7963] let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all
939987 [7964] his might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance.
939987 [7965] Alyoshaâ€™s finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it
939987 [7966] began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly
939987 [7967] round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood
939987 [7968] waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
939987 [7969] him.
939987 [7970] 
939987 [7971] â€œVery well,â€ he said, â€œyou see how badly youâ€™ve bitten me. Thatâ€™s enough,
939987 [7972] isnâ€™t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?â€
939987 [7973] 
939987 [7974] The boy stared in amazement.
939987 [7975] 
939987 [7976] â€œThough I donâ€™t know you and itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve seen you,â€ Alyosha
939987 [7977] went on with the same serenity, â€œyet I must have done something to youâ€”you
939987 [7978] wouldnâ€™t have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How have
939987 [7979] I wronged you, tell me?â€
939987 [7980] 
939987 [7981] Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away.
939987 [7982] Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a long
939987 [7983] time he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turning
939987 [7984] his head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his
939987 [7985] mind to find him out as soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery.
939987 [7986] Just now he had not the time.
939987 [7987] 
939987 [7988] 
939987 [7989] 
939987 [7990] Chapter IV. At The Hohlakovsâ€™
939987 [7991] 
939987 [7992] 
939987 [7993] Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakovâ€™s house, a handsome stone house of
939987 [7994] two stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame Hohlakov spent
939987 [7995] most of her time in another province where she had an estate, or in
939987 [7996] Moscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she had a house in our town
939987 [7997] too, inherited from her forefathers. The estate in our district was the
939987 [7998] largest of her three estates, yet she had been very little in our province
939987 [7999] before this time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.
939987 [8000] 
939987 [8001] â€œDid you get my letter about the new miracle?â€ She spoke rapidly and
939987 [8002] nervously.
939987 [8003] 
939987 [8004] â€œYes.â€
939987 [8005] 
939987 [8006] â€œDid you show it to every one? He restored the son to his mother!â€
939987 [8007] 
939987 [8008] â€œHe is dying to-day,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [8009] 
939987 [8010] â€œI have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some one,
939987 [8011] about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I canâ€™t see him!
939987 [8012] The whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense. But nowâ€”do you
939987 [8013] know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?â€
939987 [8014] 
939987 [8015] â€œAh, thatâ€™s lucky,â€ cried Alyosha. â€œThen I shall see her here. She told me
939987 [8016] yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.â€
939987 [8017] 
939987 [8018] â€œI know, I know all. Iâ€™ve heard exactly what happened yesterdayâ€”and the
939987 [8019] atrocious behavior of thatâ€”creature. _Câ€™est tragique_, and if Iâ€™d been in
939987 [8020] her place I donâ€™t know what I should have done. And your brother Dmitri
939987 [8021] Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?â€”my goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch,
939987 [8022] I am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there with her, not that
939987 [8023] dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan
939987 [8024] Fyodorovitch, he is sitting with her talking; they are having a serious
939987 [8025] conversation. If you could only imagine whatâ€™s passing between them
939987 [8026] nowâ€”itâ€™s awful, I tell you itâ€™s lacerating, itâ€™s like some incredible tale
939987 [8027] of horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
939987 [8028] They both recognize it and revel in it. Iâ€™ve been watching for you! Iâ€™ve
939987 [8029] been thirsting for you! Itâ€™s too much for me, thatâ€™s the worst of it. Iâ€™ll
939987 [8030] tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of something else,
939987 [8031] the most important thingâ€”I had quite forgotten whatâ€™s most important. Tell
939987 [8032] me, why has Lise been in hysterics? As soon as she heard you were here,
939987 [8033] she began to be hysterical!â€
939987 [8034] 
939987 [8035] â€œ_Maman_, itâ€™s you who are hysterical now, not I,â€ Liseâ€™s voice caroled
939987 [8036] through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice sounded as though
939987 [8037] she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to control it. Alyosha at
939987 [8038] once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping through it, but that
939987 [8039] he could not see.
939987 [8040] 
939987 [8041] â€œAnd no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me hysterical
939987 [8042] too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has been so ill all
939987 [8043] night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the morning and for
939987 [8044] Herzenstube to come. He says that he can make nothing of it, that we must
939987 [8045] wait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it. As
939987 [8046] soon as you approached the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and
939987 [8047] insisted on being wheeled back into this room here.â€
939987 [8048] 
939987 [8049] â€œMamma, I didnâ€™t know he had come. It wasnâ€™t on his account I wanted to be
939987 [8050] wheeled into this room.â€
939987 [8051] 
939987 [8052] â€œThatâ€™s not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch was
939987 [8053] coming. She was on the look-out for you.â€
939987 [8054] 
939987 [8055] â€œMy darling mamma, itâ€™s not at all clever of you. But if you want to make
939987 [8056] up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma, youâ€™d better tell our
939987 [8057] honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he has shown his want of wit by
939987 [8058] venturing to us after what happened yesterday and although every one is
939987 [8059] laughing at him.â€
939987 [8060] 
939987 [8061] â€œLise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who laughs at
939987 [8062] him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I canâ€™t do without him. Oh,
939987 [8063] Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!â€
939987 [8064] 
939987 [8065] â€œBut whatâ€™s the matter with you, mamma, darling?â€
939987 [8066] 
939987 [8067] â€œAh, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful night
939987 [8068] of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting, everlasting,
939987 [8069] thatâ€™s the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything.... Even that
939987 [8070] miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how it has shattered me, that
939987 [8071] miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And that tragedy in the drawing-room,
939987 [8072] itâ€™s more than I can bear, I warn you. I canâ€™t bear it. A comedy, perhaps,
939987 [8073] not a tragedy. Tell me, will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he?
939987 [8074] Oh, my God! What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and see
939987 [8075] that itâ€™s all nonsense, all nonsense.â€
939987 [8076] 
939987 [8077] â€œI should be very grateful,â€ Alyosha interrupted suddenly, â€œif you could
939987 [8078] give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have hurt it, and itâ€™s
939987 [8079] very painful.â€
939987 [8080] 
939987 [8081] Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked with blood.
939987 [8082] Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.
939987 [8083] 
939987 [8084] â€œGood heavens, what a wound, how awful!â€
939987 [8085] 
939987 [8086] But as soon as Lise saw Alyoshaâ€™s finger through the crack, she flung the
939987 [8087] door wide open.
939987 [8088] 
939987 [8089] â€œCome, come here,â€ she cried, imperiously. â€œNo nonsense now! Good heavens,
939987 [8090] why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time? He might
939987 [8091] have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water! You must wash
939987 [8092] it first of all, simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain, and keep
939987 [8093] it there, keep it there.... Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin.
939987 [8094] But do make haste,â€ she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at
939987 [8095] the sight of Alyoshaâ€™s wound.
939987 [8096] 
939987 [8097] â€œShouldnâ€™t we send for Herzenstube?â€ cried Madame Hohlakov.
939987 [8098] 
939987 [8099] â€œMamma, youâ€™ll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say that
939987 [8100] he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodnessâ€™ sake go
939987 [8101] yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can come
939987 [8102] quickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.â€
939987 [8103] 
939987 [8104] â€œWhy, itâ€™s nothing much,â€ cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.
939987 [8105] 
939987 [8106] Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.
939987 [8107] 
939987 [8108] â€œSome lint, mamma, for mercyâ€™s sake, bring some lint and that muddy
939987 [8109] caustic lotion for wounds, whatâ€™s it called? Weâ€™ve got some. You know
939987 [8110] where the bottle is, mamma; itâ€™s in your bedroom in the right-hand
939987 [8111] cupboard, thereâ€™s a big bottle of it there with the lint.â€
939987 [8112] 
939987 [8113] â€œIâ€™ll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only donâ€™t scream and donâ€™t
939987 [8114] fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you get
939987 [8115] such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [8116] 
939987 [8117] Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.
939987 [8118] 
939987 [8119] â€œFirst of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?â€ she
939987 [8120] asked Alyosha, quickly. â€œAnd then Iâ€™ll talk to you about something quite
939987 [8121] different. Well?â€
939987 [8122] 
939987 [8123] Instinctively feeling that the time of her motherâ€™s absence was precious
939987 [8124] for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the
939987 [8125] schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at his
939987 [8126] story.
939987 [8127] 
939987 [8128] â€œHow can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?â€ she cried
939987 [8129] angrily, as though she had a right to control him. â€œYou are nothing but a
939987 [8130] boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you must find out for
939987 [8131] me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for thereâ€™s some
939987 [8132] mystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a question: does the
939987 [8133] pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things, but talking
939987 [8134] sensibly?â€
939987 [8135] 
939987 [8136] â€œOf course not, and I donâ€™t feel much pain now.â€
939987 [8137] 
939987 [8138] â€œThatâ€™s because your finger is in the water. It must be changed directly,
939987 [8139] for it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice from the cellar
939987 [8140] and another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can speak; will you give me
939987 [8141] the letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey Fyodorovitchâ€”be quick, for
939987 [8142] mamma will be back in a minute and I donâ€™t wantâ€”â€
939987 [8143] 
939987 [8144] â€œI havenâ€™t got the letter.â€
939987 [8145] 
939987 [8146] â€œThatâ€™s not true, you have. I knew you would say that. Youâ€™ve got it in
939987 [8147] that pocket. Iâ€™ve been regretting that joke all night. Give me back the
939987 [8148] letter at once, give it me.â€
939987 [8149] 
939987 [8150] â€œIâ€™ve left it at home.â€
939987 [8151] 
939987 [8152] â€œBut you canâ€™t consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly
939987 [8153] joke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me the
939987 [8154] letter, if you really havenâ€™t got itâ€”bring it to-day, you must, you must.â€
939987 [8155] 
939987 [8156] â€œTo-day I canâ€™t possibly, for I am going back to the monastery and I
939987 [8157] shanâ€™t come and see you for the next two daysâ€”three or four perhapsâ€”for
939987 [8158] Father Zossimaâ€”â€
939987 [8159] 
939987 [8160] â€œFour days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very much?â€
939987 [8161] 
939987 [8162] â€œI didnâ€™t laugh at all.â€
939987 [8163] 
939987 [8164] â€œWhy not?â€
939987 [8165] 
939987 [8166] â€œBecause I believed all you said.â€
939987 [8167] 
939987 [8168] â€œYou are insulting me!â€
939987 [8169] 
939987 [8170] â€œNot at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would come to
939987 [8171] pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the monastery.
939987 [8172] Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you reach the legal
939987 [8173] age we will be married. I shall love you. Though I havenâ€™t had time to
939987 [8174] think about it, I believe I couldnâ€™t find a better wife than you, and
939987 [8175] Father Zossima tells me I must marry.â€
939987 [8176] 
939987 [8177] â€œBut I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,â€ laughed Lise, flushing
939987 [8178] crimson.
939987 [8179] 
939987 [8180] â€œIâ€™ll wheel you about myself, but Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get well by then.â€
939987 [8181] 
939987 [8182] â€œBut you are mad,â€ said Lise, nervously, â€œto make all this nonsense out of
939987 [8183] a joke! Hereâ€™s mamma, very _Ã  propos_, perhaps. Mamma, how slow you always
939987 [8184] are, how can you be so long! And hereâ€™s Yulia with the ice!â€
939987 [8185] 
939987 [8186] â€œOh, Lise, donâ€™t scream, above all things donâ€™t scream. That scream drives
939987 [8187] me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place? Iâ€™ve been
939987 [8188] hunting and huntingâ€”I do believe you did it on purpose.â€
939987 [8189] 
939987 [8190] â€œBut I couldnâ€™t tell that he would come with a bad finger, or else perhaps
939987 [8191] I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you begin to say really
939987 [8192] witty things.â€
939987 [8193] 
939987 [8194] â€œNever mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling for
939987 [8195] Alexey Fyodorovitchâ€™s sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, whatâ€™s
939987 [8196] killing me is no one thing in particular, not Herzenstube, but everything
939987 [8197] together, thatâ€™s what is too much for me.â€
939987 [8198] 
939987 [8199] â€œThatâ€™s enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,â€ Lise laughed gayly.
939987 [8200] â€œMake haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. Thatâ€™s simply Goulardâ€™s
939987 [8201] water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but itâ€™s a splendid
939987 [8202] lotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had a fight with
939987 [8203] the boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger, isnâ€™t he a child,
939987 [8204] a child himself? Is he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he
939987 [8205] wants to be married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldnâ€™t it be
939987 [8206] funny, wouldnâ€™t it be awful?â€
939987 [8207] 
939987 [8208] And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly at
939987 [8209] Alyosha.
939987 [8210] 
939987 [8211] â€œBut why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? Itâ€™s quite
939987 [8212] out of placeâ€”and perhaps the boy was rabid.â€
939987 [8213] 
939987 [8214] â€œWhy, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!â€
939987 [8215] 
939987 [8216] â€œWhy not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might have
939987 [8217] been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near
939987 [8218] him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldnâ€™t have
939987 [8219] done it. Do you still feel the pain?â€
939987 [8220] 
939987 [8221] â€œItâ€™s nothing much now.â€
939987 [8222] 
939987 [8223] â€œYou donâ€™t feel afraid of water?â€ asked Lise.
939987 [8224] 
939987 [8225] â€œCome, thatâ€™s enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick talking
939987 [8226] of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [8227] has only just heard that you are here, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply
939987 [8228] rushed at me, sheâ€™s dying to see you, dying!â€
939987 [8229] 
939987 [8230] â€œAch, mamma, go to them yourself. He canâ€™t go just now, he is in too much
939987 [8231] pain.â€
939987 [8232] 
939987 [8233] â€œNot at all, I can go quite well,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [8234] 
939987 [8235] â€œWhat! You are going away? Is that what you say?â€
939987 [8236] 
939987 [8237] â€œWell, when Iâ€™ve seen them, Iâ€™ll come back here and we can talk as much as
939987 [8238] you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once, for I am
939987 [8239] very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can.â€
939987 [8240] 
939987 [8241] â€œMamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, donâ€™t trouble to come
939987 [8242] and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your monastery and a good
939987 [8243] riddance. I want to sleep, I didnâ€™t sleep all night.â€
939987 [8244] 
939987 [8245] â€œAh, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would sleep!â€ cried
939987 [8246] Madame Hohlakov.
939987 [8247] 
939987 [8248] â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve done.... Iâ€™ll stay another three minutes, five if
939987 [8249] you like,â€ muttered Alyosha.
939987 [8250] 
939987 [8251] â€œEven five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a monster.â€
939987 [8252] 
939987 [8253] â€œLise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too
939987 [8254] capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one has with
939987 [8255] nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you.
939987 [8256] How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how fortunate it is!â€
939987 [8257] 
939987 [8258] â€œAh, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it, mamma.â€
939987 [8259] 
939987 [8260] â€œAnd I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ Madame Hohlakov
939987 [8261] began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid whisper. â€œI donâ€™t
939987 [8262] want to suggest anything, I donâ€™t want to lift the veil, you will see for
939987 [8263] yourself whatâ€™s going on. Itâ€™s appalling. Itâ€™s the most fantastic farce.
939987 [8264] She loves your brother, Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuade
939987 [8265] herself she loves your brother, Dmitri. Itâ€™s appalling! Iâ€™ll go in with
939987 [8266] you, and if they donâ€™t turn me out, Iâ€™ll stay to the end.â€
939987 [8267] 
939987 [8268] 
939987 [8269] 
939987 [8270] Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room
939987 [8271] 
939987 [8272] 
939987 [8273] But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over. Katerina
939987 [8274] Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment
939987 [8275] Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take
939987 [8276] leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For
939987 [8277] this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some
939987 [8278] time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times
939987 [8279] suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [8280] and, what was more, that he meant â€œto carry her offâ€ from Dmitri. Until
939987 [8281] quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him
939987 [8282] extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between
939987 [8283] them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was
939987 [8284] glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him,
939987 [8285] Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that
939987 [8286] Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had
939987 [8287] till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a
939987 [8288] steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till
939987 [8289] the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving
939987 [8290] a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he
939987 [8291] was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.
939987 [8292] 
939987 [8293] But during yesterdayâ€™s scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him.
939987 [8294] The word â€œlacerating,â€ which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered, almost made
939987 [8295] him start, because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had cried
939987 [8296] out â€œLaceration, laceration,â€ probably applying it to his dream. He had
939987 [8297] been dreaming all night of the previous dayâ€™s scene at Katerina
939987 [8298] Ivanovnaâ€™s. Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakovâ€™s blunt and
939987 [8299] persistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and
939987 [8300] only deceived herself through some sort of pose, from â€œself-laceration,â€
939987 [8301] and tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied
939987 [8302] duty of gratitude. â€œYes,â€ he thought, â€œperhaps the whole truth lies in
939987 [8303] those words.â€ But in that case what was Ivanâ€™s position? Alyosha felt
939987 [8304] instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s must dominate, and
939987 [8305] she could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan.
939987 [8306] For Dmitri might at last submit to her domination â€œto his own happinessâ€
939987 [8307] (which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivanâ€”no, Ivan could not
939987 [8308] submit to her, and such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha
939987 [8309] could not help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and
939987 [8310] reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room.
939987 [8311] Another idea, too, forced itself upon him: â€œWhat if she loved neither of
939987 [8312] themâ€”neither Ivan nor Dmitri?â€
939987 [8313] 
939987 [8314] It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts
939987 [8315] and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month.
939987 [8316] â€œWhat do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?â€
939987 [8317] he thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was
939987 [8318] impossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry
939987 [8319] was of immense importance in his brothersâ€™ lives and that a great deal
939987 [8320] depended upon it.
939987 [8321] 
939987 [8322] â€œOne reptile will devour the other,â€ Ivan had pronounced the day before,
939987 [8323] speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as
939987 [8324] a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he had known
939987 [8325] Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares
939987 [8326] yesterday, but that only made it more important. If he felt like that,
939987 [8327] what chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new
939987 [8328] grounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of them
939987 [8329] was Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them? He
939987 [8330] loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of these
939987 [8331] conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, and
939987 [8332] Alyoshaâ€™s heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was always
939987 [8333] of an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If he loved any
939987 [8334] one, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so he must know what he
939987 [8335] was aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and having
939987 [8336] ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of
939987 [8337] a definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all
939987 [8338] sides. â€œIt was lacerating,â€ as was said just now. But what could he
939987 [8339] understand even in this â€œlacerationâ€? He did not understand the first word
939987 [8340] in this perplexing maze.
939987 [8341] 
939987 [8342] Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan, who
939987 [8343] had already got up to go, â€œA minute! Stay another minute! I want to hear
939987 [8344] the opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Donâ€™t go away,â€
939987 [8345] she added, addressing Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside
939987 [8346] her, and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.
939987 [8347] 
939987 [8348] â€œYou are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear friends,â€
939987 [8349] she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of
939987 [8350] suffering, and Alyoshaâ€™s heart warmed to her at once. â€œYou, Alexey
939987 [8351] Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene, and saw
939987 [8352] what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did. What he thought
939987 [8353] of me yesterday I donâ€™t know. I only know one thing, that if it were
939987 [8354] repeated to-day, this minute, I should express the same feelings again as
939987 [8355] yesterdayâ€”the same feelings, the same words, the same actions. You
939987 [8356] remember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of themâ€
939987 [8357] ... (as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). â€œI must tell you
939987 [8358] that I canâ€™t get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I donâ€™t even know
939987 [8359] whether I still love _him_. I feel _pity_ for him, and that is a poor sign
939987 [8360] of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I shouldnâ€™t be
939987 [8361] sorry for him now, but should hate him.â€
939987 [8362] 
939987 [8363] Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha
939987 [8364] shuddered inwardly. â€œThat girl is truthful and sincere,â€ he thought, â€œand
939987 [8365] she does not love Dmitri any more.â€
939987 [8366] 
939987 [8367] â€œThatâ€™s true, thatâ€™s true,â€ cried Madame Hohlakov.
939987 [8368] 
939987 [8369] â€œWait, dear. I havenâ€™t told you the chief, the final decision I came to
939987 [8370] during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible oneâ€”for
939987 [8371] me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change itâ€”nothing. It
939987 [8372] will be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful and generous adviser,
939987 [8373] the one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep
939987 [8374] insight into the heart, approves and commends my decision. He knows it.â€
939987 [8375] 
939987 [8376] â€œYes, I approve of it,â€ Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
939987 [8377] 
939987 [8378] â€œBut I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive my
939987 [8379] calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, to
939987 [8380] tell me before my two friends whether I am right. I feel instinctively
939987 [8381] that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are a dear brother to me),â€
939987 [8382] she said again ecstatically, taking his cold hand in her hot one, â€œI
939987 [8383] foresee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in spite
939987 [8384] of all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and submitâ€”I
939987 [8385] feel that.â€
939987 [8386] 
939987 [8387] â€œI donâ€™t know what you are asking me,â€ said Alyosha, flushing. â€œI only
939987 [8388] know that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than
939987 [8389] my own!... But I know nothing about such affairs,â€ something impelled him
939987 [8390] to add hurriedly.
939987 [8391] 
939987 [8392] â€œIn such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing is
939987 [8393] honor and duty and something higherâ€”I donâ€™t know whatâ€”but higher perhaps
939987 [8394] even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart,
939987 [8395] and it compels me irresistibly. But it may all be put in two words. Iâ€™ve
939987 [8396] already decided, even if he marries thatâ€”creature,â€ she began solemnly,
939987 [8397] â€œwhom I never, never can forgive, _even then I will not abandon him_.
939987 [8398] Henceforward I will never, never abandon him!â€ she cried, breaking into a
939987 [8399] sort of pale, hysterical ecstasy. â€œNot that I would run after him
939987 [8400] continually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to
939987 [8401] another townâ€”where you likeâ€”but I will watch over him all my lifeâ€”I will
939987 [8402] watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy with that
939987 [8403] woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let him come to me and he
939987 [8404] will find a friend, a sister.... Only a sister, of course, and so for
939987 [8405] ever; but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister,
939987 [8406] who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him. I will gain my
939987 [8407] point. I will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me,
939987 [8408] without reserve,â€ she cried, in a sort of frenzy. â€œI will be a god to whom
939987 [8409] he can prayâ€”and that, at least, he owes me for his treachery and for what
939987 [8410] I suffered yesterday through him. And let him see that all my life I will
939987 [8411] be true to him and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue
939987 [8412] and betraying me. I willâ€”I will become nothing but a means for his
939987 [8413] happiness, orâ€”how shall I say?â€”an instrument, a machine for his happiness,
939987 [8414] and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may see that all
939987 [8415] his life! Thatâ€™s my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.â€
939987 [8416] 
939987 [8417] She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea with more
939987 [8418] dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried and crude. It
939987 [8419] was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she was still
939987 [8420] smarting from yesterdayâ€™s insult, and that her pride craved satisfaction.
939987 [8421] She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look came
939987 [8422] into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy. His
939987 [8423] brother Ivan made it worse by adding:
939987 [8424] 
939987 [8425] â€œIâ€™ve only expressed my own view,â€ he said. â€œFrom any one else, this would
939987 [8426] have been affected and overstrained, but from youâ€”no. Any other woman
939987 [8427] would have been wrong, but you are right. I donâ€™t know how to explain it,
939987 [8428] but I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore, you are right.â€
939987 [8429] 
939987 [8430] â€œBut thatâ€™s only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for?
939987 [8431] Nothing but yesterdayâ€™s insult.â€ Madame Hohlakov obviously had not
939987 [8432] intended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very just
939987 [8433] comment.
939987 [8434] 
939987 [8435] â€œQuite so, quite so,â€ cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously
939987 [8436] annoyed at being interrupted, â€œin any one else this moment would be only
939987 [8437] due to yesterdayâ€™s impression and would be only a moment. But with
939987 [8438] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s character, that moment will last all her life. What
939987 [8439] for any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting
939987 [8440] burdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty. And she will be sustained
939987 [8441] by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [8442] will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your
939987 [8443] own heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will be
939987 [8444] softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a
939987 [8445] bold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any
939987 [8446] case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of it will at last be a
939987 [8447] source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything
939987 [8448] else.â€
939987 [8449] 
939987 [8450] This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention;
939987 [8451] even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with
939987 [8452] intention.
939987 [8453] 
939987 [8454] â€œOh, dear, how mistaken it all is!â€ Madame Hohlakov cried again.
939987 [8455] 
939987 [8456] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you will
939987 [8457] say!â€ cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears. Alyosha got up from
939987 [8458] the sofa.
939987 [8459] 
939987 [8460] â€œItâ€™s nothing, nothing!â€ she went on through her tears. â€œIâ€™m upset, I
939987 [8461] didnâ€™t sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends as you and
939987 [8462] your brother I still feel strongâ€”for I knowâ€”you two will never desert me.â€
939987 [8463] 
939987 [8464] â€œUnluckily I am obliged to return to Moscowâ€”perhaps to-morrowâ€”and to leave
939987 [8465] you for a long timeâ€”And, unluckily, itâ€™s unavoidable,â€ Ivan said suddenly.
939987 [8466] 
939987 [8467] â€œTo-morrowâ€”to Moscow!â€ her face was suddenly contorted; â€œbutâ€”but, dear me,
939987 [8468] how fortunate!â€ she cried in a voice suddenly changed. In one instant
939987 [8469] there was no trace left of her tears. She underwent an instantaneous
939987 [8470] transformation, which amazed Alyosha. Instead of a poor, insulted girl,
939987 [8471] weeping in a sort of â€œlaceration,â€ he saw a woman completely
939987 [8472] self-possessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable
939987 [8473] had just happened.
939987 [8474] 
939987 [8475] â€œOh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,â€ she corrected
939987 [8476] herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. â€œSuch a friend as you are
939987 [8477] could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you.â€ She rushed
939987 [8478] impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his hands, pressed them warmly. â€œBut
939987 [8479] what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and
939987 [8480] Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position. You can
939987 [8481] speak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will
939987 [8482] know how to do that. You canâ€™t think how wretched I was yesterday and this
939987 [8483] morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful letterâ€”for one can
939987 [8484] never tell such things in a letter.... Now it will be easy for me to
939987 [8485] write, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I am!
939987 [8486] But I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can take your
939987 [8487] place.... I will run at once to write the letter,â€ she finished suddenly,
939987 [8488] and took a step as though to go out of the room.
939987 [8489] 
939987 [8490] â€œAnd what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so desperately
939987 [8491] anxious to hear?â€ cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry note
939987 [8492] in her voice.
939987 [8493] 
939987 [8494] â€œI had not forgotten that,â€ cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a sudden
939987 [8495] standstill, â€œand why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?â€ she added,
939987 [8496] with warm and bitter reproachfulness. â€œWhat I said, I repeat. I must have
939987 [8497] his opinion. More than that, I must have his decision! As he says, so it
939987 [8498] shall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch....
939987 [8499] But whatâ€™s the matter?â€
939987 [8500] 
939987 [8501] â€œI couldnâ€™t have believed it. I canâ€™t understand it!â€ Alyosha cried
939987 [8502] suddenly in distress.
939987 [8503] 
939987 [8504] â€œWhat? What?â€
939987 [8505] 
939987 [8506] â€œHe is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You said that
939987 [8507] on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but
939987 [8508] sorry to beâ€”losing a friend. But that was acting, tooâ€”you were playing a
939987 [8509] partâ€”as in a theater!â€
939987 [8510] 
939987 [8511] â€œIn a theater? What? What do you mean?â€ exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [8512] profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
939987 [8513] 
939987 [8514] â€œThough you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him, you persist
939987 [8515] in telling him to his face that itâ€™s fortunate he is going,â€ said Alyosha
939987 [8516] breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not sit down.
939987 [8517] 
939987 [8518] â€œWhat are you talking about? I donâ€™t understand.â€
939987 [8519] 
939987 [8520] â€œI donâ€™t understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I am
939987 [8521] not saying it properly, but Iâ€™ll say it all the same,â€ Alyosha went on in
939987 [8522] the same shaking and broken voice. â€œWhat I see is that perhaps you donâ€™t
939987 [8523] love Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri,
939987 [8524] too, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I really donâ€™t know
939987 [8525] how I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for
939987 [8526] nobody here will tell the truth.â€
939987 [8527] 
939987 [8528] â€œWhat truth?â€ cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring in
939987 [8529] her voice.
939987 [8530] 
939987 [8531] â€œIâ€™ll tell you,â€ Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he were
939987 [8532] jumping from the top of a house. â€œCall Dmitri; I will fetch himâ€”and let
939987 [8533] him come here and take your hand and take Ivanâ€™s and join your hands. For
939987 [8534] youâ€™re torturing Ivan, simply because you love himâ€”and torturing him,
939987 [8535] because you love Dmitri through â€˜self-lacerationâ€™â€”with an unreal
939987 [8536] loveâ€”because youâ€™ve persuaded yourself.â€
939987 [8537] 
939987 [8538] Alyosha broke off and was silent.
939987 [8539] 
939987 [8540] â€œYou ... you ... you are a little religious idiotâ€”thatâ€™s what you are!â€
939987 [8541] Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving
939987 [8542] with anger.
939987 [8543] 
939987 [8544] Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.
939987 [8545] 
939987 [8546] â€œYou are mistaken, my good Alyosha,â€ he said, with an expression Alyosha
939987 [8547] had never seen in his face beforeâ€”an expression of youthful sincerity and
939987 [8548] strong, irresistibly frank feeling. â€œKaterina Ivanovna has never cared for
939987 [8549] me! She has known all the time that I cared for herâ€”though I never said a
939987 [8550] word of my love to herâ€”she knew, but she didnâ€™t care for me. I have never
939987 [8551] been her friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my
939987 [8552] friendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged
939987 [8553] with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receiving
939987 [8554] from Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that first meeting
939987 [8555] has rankled in her heart as an insultâ€”thatâ€™s what her heart is like! She
939987 [8556] has talked to me of nothing but her love for him. I am going now; but,
939987 [8557] believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more he
939987 [8558] insults you, the more you love himâ€”thatâ€™s your â€˜laceration.â€™ You love him
939987 [8559] just as he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, youâ€™d give
939987 [8560] him up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as to
939987 [8561] contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for
939987 [8562] infidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, thereâ€™s a great deal of
939987 [8563] humiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride.... I
939987 [8564] am too young and Iâ€™ve loved you too much. I know that I ought not to say
939987 [8565] this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you, and
939987 [8566] it would be less offensive for you. But I am going far away, and shall
939987 [8567] never come back.... It is for ever. I donâ€™t want to sit beside a
939987 [8568] â€˜laceration.â€™... But I donâ€™t know how to speak now. Iâ€™ve said
939987 [8569] everything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna; you canâ€™t be angry with me, for
939987 [8570] I am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the fact
939987 [8571] that I shall never see you again. Good-by! I donâ€™t want your hand. You
939987 [8572] have tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this
939987 [8573] moment. I shall forgive you later, but now I donâ€™t want your hand. â€˜Den
939987 [8574] Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,â€™ â€ he added, with a forced smile, showing,
939987 [8575] however, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he knew him by
939987 [8576] heartâ€”which Alyosha would never have believed. He went out of the room
939987 [8577] without saying good-by even to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha
939987 [8578] clasped his hands.
939987 [8579] 
939987 [8580] â€œIvan!â€ he cried desperately after him. â€œCome back, Ivan! No, nothing will
939987 [8581] induce him to come back now!â€ he cried again, regretfully realizing it;
939987 [8582] â€œbut itâ€™s my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly.
939987 [8583] Unjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come back,â€ Alyosha kept
939987 [8584] exclaiming frantically.
939987 [8585] 
939987 [8586] Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
939987 [8587] 
939987 [8588] â€œYou have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,â€ Madame
939987 [8589] Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. â€œI will do my
939987 [8590] utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.â€
939987 [8591] 
939987 [8592] Her face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, but
939987 [8593] Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble notes in
939987 [8594] her hand.
939987 [8595] 
939987 [8596] â€œI have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ she began,
939987 [8597] addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though
939987 [8598] nothing had happened. â€œA weekâ€”yes, I think it was a week agoâ€”Dmitri
939987 [8599] Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust actionâ€”a very ugly action.
939987 [8600] There is a low tavern here, and in it he met that discharged officer, that
939987 [8601] captain, whom your father used to employ in some business. Dmitri
939987 [8602] Fyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this captain, seized him by the
939987 [8603] beard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it,
939987 [8604] in that insulting fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a
939987 [8605] child, who is at the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and
939987 [8606] begging for his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every
939987 [8607] one laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think
939987 [8608] without indignation of that disgraceful action of _his_ ... one of those
939987 [8609] actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger
939987 [8610] ... and in his passions! I canâ€™t describe it even.... I canâ€™t find my
939987 [8611] words. Iâ€™ve made inquiries about his victim, and find he is quite a poor
939987 [8612] man. His name is Snegiryov. He did something wrong in the army and was
939987 [8613] discharged. I canâ€™t tell you what. And now he has sunk into terrible
939987 [8614] destitution, with his familyâ€”an unhappy family of sick children, and, I
939987 [8615] believe, an insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to
939987 [8616] work as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought if you
939987 [8617] ... that is I thought ... I donâ€™t know. I am so confused. You see, I
939987 [8618] wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find some
939987 [8619] excuse to go to themâ€”I mean to that captainâ€”oh, goodness, how badly I
939987 [8620] explain it!â€”and delicately, carefully, as only you know how toâ€ (Alyosha
939987 [8621] blushed), â€œmanage to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles.
939987 [8622] He will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,
939987 [8623] rather, what do I mean? You see itâ€™s not by way of compensation to prevent
939987 [8624] him from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to), but simply a
939987 [8625] token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me, Dmitri
939987 [8626] Fyodorovitchâ€™s betrothed, not from himself.... But you know.... I would go
939987 [8627] myself, but youâ€™ll know how to do it ever so much better. He lives in Lake
939987 [8628] Street, in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.... For Godâ€™s sake, Alexey
939987 [8629] Fyodorovitch, do it for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired.
939987 [8630] Good-by!â€
939987 [8631] 
939987 [8632] She turned and disappeared behind the portiÃ¨re so quickly that Alyosha had
939987 [8633] not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to beg her
939987 [8634] pardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was full and he
939987 [8635] could not bear to go out of the room without it. But Madame Hohlakov took
939987 [8636] him by the hand and drew him along with her. In the hall she stopped him
939987 [8637] again as before.
939987 [8638] 
939987 [8639] â€œShe is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,
939987 [8640] generous,â€ she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. â€œOh, how I love her,
939987 [8641] especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear Alexey
939987 [8642] Fyodorovitch, you didnâ€™t know, but I must tell you, that we all, allâ€”both
939987 [8643] her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, evenâ€”have been hoping and praying for
939987 [8644] nothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite Dmitri,
939987 [8645] who takes no notice of her and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan
939987 [8646] Fyodorovitchâ€”such an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her
939987 [8647] more than anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it
939987 [8648] about, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.â€
939987 [8649] 
939987 [8650] â€œBut she has been cryingâ€”she has been wounded again,â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [8651] 
939987 [8652] â€œNever trust a womanâ€™s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the
939987 [8653] women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.â€
939987 [8654] 
939987 [8655] â€œMamma, you are spoiling him,â€ Liseâ€™s little voice cried from behind the
939987 [8656] door.
939987 [8657] 
939987 [8658] â€œNo, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,â€ Alyosha repeated
939987 [8659] unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his
939987 [8660] indiscretion.
939987 [8661] 
939987 [8662] â€œQuite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready
939987 [8663] to say so a thousand times over.â€
939987 [8664] 
939987 [8665] â€œMamma, how has he behaved like an angel?â€ Liseâ€™s voice was heard again.
939987 [8666] 
939987 [8667] â€œI somehow fancied all at once,â€ Alyosha went on as though he had not
939987 [8668] heard Lise, â€œthat she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing.... What
939987 [8669] will happen now?â€
939987 [8670] 
939987 [8671] â€œTo whom, to whom?â€ cried Lise. â€œMamma, you really want to be the death of
939987 [8672] me. I ask you and you donâ€™t answer.â€
939987 [8673] 
939987 [8674] At the moment the maid ran in.
939987 [8675] 
939987 [8676] â€œKaterina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.â€
939987 [8677] 
939987 [8678] â€œWhat is the matter?â€ cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. â€œMamma, I
939987 [8679] shall be having hysterics, and not she!â€
939987 [8680] 
939987 [8681] â€œLise, for mercyâ€™s sake, donâ€™t scream, donâ€™t persecute me. At your age one
939987 [8682] canâ€™t know everything that grown-up people know. Iâ€™ll come and tell you
939987 [8683] everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am
939987 [8684] coming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; itâ€™s an
939987 [8685] excellent thing that she is hysterical. Thatâ€™s just as it ought to be. In
939987 [8686] such cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tears
939987 [8687] and hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that Iâ€™ll fly to her. As for Ivan
939987 [8688] Fyodorovitchâ€™s going away like that, itâ€™s her own fault. But he wonâ€™t go
939987 [8689] away. Lise, for mercyâ€™s sake, donâ€™t scream! Oh, yes; you are not
939987 [8690] screaming. Itâ€™s I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted,
939987 [8691] delighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how
939987 [8692] young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said all
939987 [8693] that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a _savant_, and all
939987 [8694] of a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such
939987 [8695] youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you.... And the way he
939987 [8696] repeated that German verse, it was just like you! But I must fly, I must
939987 [8697] fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her commission, and then
939987 [8698] make haste back. Lise, do you want anything now? For mercyâ€™s sake, donâ€™t
939987 [8699] keep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.â€
939987 [8700] 
939987 [8701] Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened
939987 [8702] the door to see Lise.
939987 [8703] 
939987 [8704] â€œOn no account,â€ cried Lise. â€œOn no account now. Speak through the door.
939987 [8705] How have you come to be an angel? Thatâ€™s the only thing I want to know.â€
939987 [8706] 
939987 [8707] â€œFor an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!â€
939987 [8708] 
939987 [8709] â€œDonâ€™t dare to go away like that!â€ Lise was beginning.
939987 [8710] 
939987 [8711] â€œLise, I have a real sorrow! Iâ€™ll be back directly, but I have a great,
939987 [8712] great sorrow!â€
939987 [8713] 
939987 [8714] And he ran out of the room.
939987 [8715] 
939987 [8716] 
939987 [8717] 
939987 [8718] Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage
939987 [8719] 
939987 [8720] 
939987 [8721] He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He had
939987 [8722] rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love-affair. â€œBut what do
939987 [8723] I know about it? What can I tell about such things?â€ he repeated to
939987 [8724] himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. â€œOh, being ashamed would
939987 [8725] be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall
939987 [8726] certainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me to
939987 [8727] reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them
939987 [8728] together?â€ Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their
939987 [8729] hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. â€œThough I acted quite
939987 [8730] sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,â€ he concluded suddenly,
939987 [8731] and did not even smile at his conclusion.
939987 [8732] 
939987 [8733] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother
939987 [8734] Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided to
939987 [8735] go to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a
939987 [8736] presentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he
939987 [8737] would intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow.
939987 [8738] Time was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for
939987 [8739] one minute from the time he set off from the monastery.
939987 [8740] 
939987 [8741] There was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina
939987 [8742] Ivanovnaâ€™s commission; when she had mentioned the captainâ€™s son, the
939987 [8743] little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at
939987 [8744] once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his
939987 [8745] finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. Now
939987 [8746] Alyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have said
939987 [8747] why. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think no
939987 [8748] more about the â€œmischiefâ€ he had done, and not to torture himself with
939987 [8749] remorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thought
939987 [8750] he was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he
939987 [8751] felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from his
939987 [8752] fatherâ€™s, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.
939987 [8753] 
939987 [8754] Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, his
939987 [8755] son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha. â€œHe
939987 [8756] hasnâ€™t slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone away,â€ the
939987 [8757] old man said in answer to Alyoshaâ€™s persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that
939987 [8758] he was answering in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he
939987 [8759] were not at Grushenkaâ€™s or in hiding at Fomaâ€™s (Alyosha spoke so freely on
939987 [8760] purpose), all three looked at him in alarm. â€œThey are fond of him, they
939987 [8761] are doing their best for him,â€ thought Alyosha. â€œThatâ€™s good.â€
939987 [8762] 
939987 [8763] At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house,
939987 [8764] sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a
939987 [8765] muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed the
939987 [8766] yard and found the door opening into the passage. On the left of the
939987 [8767] passage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Both
939987 [8768] seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one
939987 [8769] of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and
939987 [8770] pointed to a door across the passage. The captainâ€™s lodging turned out to
939987 [8771] be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open
939987 [8772] the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from
939987 [8773] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s words that the man had a family. â€œEither they are all
939987 [8774] asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open
939987 [8775] the door. Iâ€™d better knock first,â€ and he knocked. An answer came, but not
939987 [8776] at once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.
939987 [8777] 
939987 [8778] â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.
939987 [8779] 
939987 [8780] Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himself
939987 [8781] in a regular peasantâ€™s room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up with
939987 [8782] domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. On
939987 [8783] the left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on the
939987 [8784] left was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags
939987 [8785] hanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and
939987 [8786] left, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of
939987 [8787] four print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the
939987 [8788] other there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was
939987 [8789] screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain
939987 [8790] could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square table
939987 [8791] of plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three windows,
939987 [8792] which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little
939987 [8793] light, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather
939987 [8794] stuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs,
939987 [8795] a half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
939987 [8796] 
939987 [8797] A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a
939987 [8798] chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunken
939987 [8799] cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what struck
939987 [8800] Alyosha most was the expression in the poor womanâ€™s eyesâ€”a look of
939987 [8801] surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking to
939987 [8802] her husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with
939987 [8803] the same haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the window
939987 [8804] stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but
939987 [8805] very neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.
939987 [8806] Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad
939987 [8807] sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled â€œwith
939987 [8808] withered legs,â€ as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches stood in the
939987 [8809] corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor
939987 [8810] girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting
939987 [8811] at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weakly
939987 [8812] built. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very much
939987 [8813] like a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase â€œa wisp of towâ€ flashed
939987 [8814] at once into Alyoshaâ€™s mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).
939987 [8815] It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there was no
939987 [8816] other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from the
939987 [8817] bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged
939987 [8818] napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
939987 [8819] 
939987 [8820] â€œItâ€™s a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!â€ the
939987 [8821] girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round instantly
939987 [8822] towards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice:
939987 [8823] 
939987 [8824] â€œNo, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,â€ he turned again to Alyosha,
939987 [8825] â€œwhat has brought you toâ€”our retreat?â€
939987 [8826] 
939987 [8827] Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen him.
939987 [8828] There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him. Though he
939987 [8829] had obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There was
939987 [8830] extraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at the
939987 [8831] same time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been kept in
939987 [8832] subjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was
939987 [8833] trying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wants
939987 [8834] dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In his
939987 [8835] words and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy
939987 [8836] humor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting
939987 [8837] from one tone to another. The question about â€œour retreatâ€ he had asked as
939987 [8838] it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close to
939987 [8839] Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed in a very
939987 [8840] shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore checked trousers of
939987 [8841] an extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material.
939987 [8842] They were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grown
939987 [8843] out of them like a boy.
939987 [8844] 
939987 [8845] â€œI am Alexey Karamazov,â€ Alyosha began in reply.
939987 [8846] 
939987 [8847] â€œI quite understand that, sir,â€ the gentleman snapped out at once to
939987 [8848] assure him that he knew who he was already. â€œI am Captain Snegiryov, sir,
939987 [8849] but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led youâ€”â€
939987 [8850] 
939987 [8851] â€œOh, Iâ€™ve come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with youâ€”if
939987 [8852] only you allow me.â€
939987 [8853] 
939987 [8854] â€œIn that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. Thatâ€™s what they
939987 [8855] used to say in the old comedies, â€˜kindly be seated,â€™ â€ and with a rapid
939987 [8856] gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, not
939987 [8857] upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then,
939987 [8858] taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha, so
939987 [8859] close to him that their knees almost touched.
939987 [8860] 
939987 [8861] â€œNikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian
939987 [8862] infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I might
939987 [8863] not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life Iâ€™ve
939987 [8864] learnt to say â€˜sir.â€™ Itâ€™s a word you use when youâ€™ve come down in the
939987 [8865] world.â€
939987 [8866] 
939987 [8867] â€œThatâ€™s very true,â€ smiled Alyosha. â€œBut is it used involuntarily or on
939987 [8868] purpose?â€
939987 [8869] 
939987 [8870] â€œAs Godâ€™s above, itâ€™s involuntary, and I usenâ€™t to use it! I didnâ€™t use
939987 [8871] the word â€˜sirâ€™ all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I began
939987 [8872] to say â€˜sir.â€™ Itâ€™s the work of a higher power. I see you are interested in
939987 [8873] contemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, living
939987 [8874] as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?â€
939987 [8875] 
939987 [8876] â€œIâ€™ve comeâ€”about that business.â€
939987 [8877] 
939987 [8878] â€œAbout what business?â€ the captain interrupted impatiently.
939987 [8879] 
939987 [8880] â€œAbout your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ Alyosha blurted
939987 [8881] out awkwardly.
939987 [8882] 
939987 [8883] â€œWhat meeting, sir? You donâ€™t mean that meeting? About my â€˜wisp of tow,â€™
939987 [8884] then?â€ He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against
939987 [8885] Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.
939987 [8886] 
939987 [8887] â€œWhat wisp of tow?â€ muttered Alyosha.
939987 [8888] 
939987 [8889] â€œHe is come to complain of me, father!â€ cried a voice familiar to
939987 [8890] Alyoshaâ€”the voice of the schoolboyâ€”from behind the curtain. â€œI bit his
939987 [8891] finger just now.â€ The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailant
939987 [8892] lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner
939987 [8893] under the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt.
939987 [8894] He was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a
939987 [8895] fever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home
939987 [8896] and could not be touched.
939987 [8897] 
939987 [8898] â€œWhat! Did he bite your finger?â€ The captain jumped up from his chair.
939987 [8899] â€œWas it your finger he bit?â€
939987 [8900] 
939987 [8901] â€œYes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of them
939987 [8902] against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me and then
939987 [8903] another at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And then he rushed
939987 [8904] at me and bit my finger badly, I donâ€™t know why.â€
939987 [8905] 
939987 [8906] â€œIâ€™ll thrash him, sir, at onceâ€”this minute!â€ The captain jumped up from
939987 [8907] his seat.
939987 [8908] 
939987 [8909] â€œBut I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I donâ€™t want
939987 [8910] him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.â€
939987 [8911] 
939987 [8912] â€œAnd do you suppose Iâ€™d thrash him? That Iâ€™d take my Ilusha and thrash him
939987 [8913] before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?â€
939987 [8914] said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were going to
939987 [8915] attack him. â€œI am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashing
939987 [8916] Ilusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here
939987 [8917] before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers
939987 [8918] would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You wonâ€™t ask for
939987 [8919] the fifth one too?â€ He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every
939987 [8920] feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely
939987 [8921] defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.
939987 [8922] 
939987 [8923] â€œI think I understand it all now,â€ said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,
939987 [8924] still keeping his seat. â€œSo your boy is a good boy, he loves his father,
939987 [8925] and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I understand
939987 [8926] it,â€ he repeated thoughtfully. â€œBut my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets
939987 [8927] his action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him to come to
939987 [8928] you, or better still, to meet you in that same place, he will ask your
939987 [8929] forgiveness before every oneâ€”if you wish it.â€
939987 [8930] 
939987 [8931] â€œAfter pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And he
939987 [8932] thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesnâ€™t he?â€
939987 [8933] 
939987 [8934] â€œOh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way you
939987 [8935] like.â€
939987 [8936] 
939987 [8937] â€œSo if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in
939987 [8938] that very tavernâ€”â€˜The Metropolisâ€™ itâ€™s calledâ€”or in the market-place, he
939987 [8939] would do it?â€
939987 [8940] 
939987 [8941] â€œYes, he would even go down on his knees.â€
939987 [8942] 
939987 [8943] â€œYouâ€™ve pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced me
939987 [8944] to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brotherâ€™s generosity. Allow
939987 [8945] me to introduce my family, my two daughters and my sonâ€”my litter. If I
939987 [8946] die, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for a
939987 [8947] wretch like me? Thatâ€™s a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man
939987 [8948] of my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man like
939987 [8949] me.â€
939987 [8950] 
939987 [8951] â€œAh, thatâ€™s perfectly true!â€ exclaimed Alyosha.
939987 [8952] 
939987 [8953] â€œOh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us to
939987 [8954] shame!â€ cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father with
939987 [8955] a disdainful and contemptuous air.
939987 [8956] 
939987 [8957] â€œWait a little, Varvara!â€ cried her father, speaking peremptorily but
939987 [8958] looking at her quite approvingly. â€œThatâ€™s her character,â€ he said,
939987 [8959] addressing Alyosha again.
939987 [8960] 
939987 [8961] 
939987 [8962]     â€œAnd in all nature there was naught
939987 [8963]     That could find favor in his eyesâ€”
939987 [8964] 
939987 [8965] 
939987 [8966] or rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now let
939987 [8967] me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is
939987 [8968] forty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. Arina
939987 [8969] Petrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
939987 [8970] Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.â€ He took him by the hand and with unexpected
939987 [8971] force pulled him up. â€œYou must stand up to be introduced to a lady. Itâ€™s
939987 [8972] not the Karamazov, mamma, who ... hâ€™m ... etcetera, but his brother,
939987 [8973] radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first your
939987 [8974] hand to be kissed.â€
939987 [8975] 
939987 [8976] And he kissed his wifeâ€™s hand respectfully and even tenderly. The girl at
939987 [8977] the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression of
939987 [8978] extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the
939987 [8979] woman.
939987 [8980] 
939987 [8981] â€œGood morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,â€ she said.
939987 [8982] 
939987 [8983] â€œKaramazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,â€ he whispered
939987 [8984] again.
939987 [8985] 
939987 [8986] â€œWell, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of
939987 [8987] Tchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me crippled,
939987 [8988] but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled up
939987 [8989] myself. Once I used to be so fat, but now itâ€™s as though I had swallowed a
939987 [8990] needle.â€
939987 [8991] 
939987 [8992] â€œWe are of humble origin,â€ the captain muttered again.
939987 [8993] 
939987 [8994] â€œOh, father, father!â€ the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent on
939987 [8995] her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.
939987 [8996] 
939987 [8997] â€œBuffoon!â€ blurted out the girl at the window.
939987 [8998] 
939987 [8999] â€œHave you heard our news?â€ said the mother, pointing at her daughters.
939987 [9000] â€œItâ€™s like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again.
939987 [9001] When we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I donâ€™t mean
939987 [9002] to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deaconâ€™s wife used
939987 [9003] to come then and say, â€˜Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest
939987 [9004] heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,â€™ she would say, â€˜is of the brood of hell.â€™
939987 [9005] â€˜Well,â€™ I said, â€˜thatâ€™s a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.â€™
939987 [9006] â€˜And you want keeping in your place,â€™ says she. â€˜You black sword,â€™ said I,
939987 [9007] â€˜who asked you to teach me?â€™ â€˜But my breath,â€™ says she, â€˜is clean, and
939987 [9008] yours is unclean.â€™ â€˜You ask all the officers whether my breath is
939987 [9009] unclean.â€™ And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long ago I was
939987 [9010] sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who came
939987 [9011] here for Easter, and I asked him: â€˜Your Excellency,â€™ said I, â€˜can a ladyâ€™s
939987 [9012] breath be unpleasant?â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ he answered; â€˜you ought to open a
939987 [9013] window-pane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.â€™ And they all
939987 [9014] go on like that! And what is my breath to them? The dead smell worse
939987 [9015] still! â€˜I wonâ€™t spoil the air,â€™ said I, â€˜Iâ€™ll order some slippers and go
939987 [9016] away.â€™ My darlings, donâ€™t blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is
939987 [9017] it I canâ€™t please you? Thereâ€™s only Ilusha who comes home from school and
939987 [9018] loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own
939987 [9019] motherâ€”forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasant
939987 [9020] to you?â€
939987 [9021] 
939987 [9022] And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her
939987 [9023] cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.
939987 [9024] 
939987 [9025] â€œMamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves
939987 [9026] you, every one adores you.â€ He began kissing both her hands again and
939987 [9027] tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he began wiping away
939987 [9028] her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes. â€œThere, you
939987 [9029] see, you hear?â€ he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the
939987 [9030] poor imbecile.
939987 [9031] 
939987 [9032] â€œI see and hear,â€ muttered Alyosha.
939987 [9033] 
939987 [9034] â€œFather, father, how can youâ€”with him! Let him alone!â€ cried the boy,
939987 [9035] sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.
939987 [9036] 
939987 [9037] â€œDo give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead to
939987 [9038] anything!â€ shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.
939987 [9039] 
939987 [9040] â€œYour anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and Iâ€™ll make haste to
939987 [9041] satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and Iâ€™ll put on
939987 [9042] mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but not
939987 [9043] within these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgot
939987 [9044] to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who has
939987 [9045] flown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.â€
939987 [9046] 
939987 [9047] â€œThere he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!â€ Varvara
939987 [9048] went on indignantly.
939987 [9049] 
939987 [9050] â€œAnd she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now, she
939987 [9051] is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call me so.
939987 [9052] Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.â€
939987 [9053] 
939987 [9054] And, snatching Alyoshaâ€™s hand, he drew him out of the room into the
939987 [9055] street.
939987 [9056] 
939987 [9057] 
939987 [9058] 
939987 [9059] Chapter VII. And In The Open Air
939987 [9060] 
939987 [9061] 
939987 [9062] â€œThe air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the
939987 [9063] word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.â€
939987 [9064] 
939987 [9065] â€œI too have something important to say to you,â€ observed Alyosha, â€œonly I
939987 [9066] donâ€™t know how to begin.â€
939987 [9067] 
939987 [9068] â€œTo be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked in
939987 [9069] upon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of the
939987 [9070] boy, and thatâ€™s hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I could not
939987 [9071] explain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you. My
939987 [9072] tow was thicker a week agoâ€”I mean my beard. Thatâ€™s the nickname they give
939987 [9073] to my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri
939987 [9074] Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, Iâ€™d done nothing, he was in a
939987 [9075] towering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of the
939987 [9076] tavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out of
939987 [9077] school, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state he
939987 [9078] rushed up to me. â€˜Father,â€™ he cried, â€˜father!â€™ He caught hold of me,
939987 [9079] hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, â€˜Let go, let go,
939987 [9080] itâ€™s my father, forgive him!â€™â€”yes, he actually cried â€˜forgive him.â€™ He
939987 [9081] clutched at that hand, that very hand, in his little hands and kissed
939987 [9082] it.... I remember his little face at that moment, I havenâ€™t forgotten it
939987 [9083] and I never shall!â€
939987 [9084] 
939987 [9085] â€œI swear,â€ cried Alyosha, â€œthat my brother will express his most deep and
939987 [9086] sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that same
939987 [9087] market-place.... Iâ€™ll make him or he is no brother of mine!â€
939987 [9088] 
939987 [9089] â€œAha, then itâ€™s only a suggestion! And it does not come from him but
939987 [9090] simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have said
939987 [9091] so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brotherâ€™s highly
939987 [9092] chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at the
939987 [9093] time. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: â€˜You are an
939987 [9094] officer,â€™ he said, â€˜and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man to
939987 [9095] be your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though
939987 [9096] you are a scoundrel.â€™ Thatâ€™s what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I
939987 [9097] retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever
939987 [9098] on Ilushaâ€™s soul. No, itâ€™s not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen.
939987 [9099] Judge for yourself. Youâ€™ve just been in our mansion, what did you see
939987 [9100] there? Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and
939987 [9101] hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a student,
939987 [9102] dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the
939987 [9103] Russian woman on the banks of the Neva. I wonâ€™t speak of Ilusha, he is
939987 [9104] only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all
939987 [9105] of them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me on
939987 [9106] the spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if he
939987 [9107] doesnâ€™t kill me but only cripples me: I couldnâ€™t work, but I should still
939987 [9108] be a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I
939987 [9109] take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? Thatâ€™s what it
939987 [9110] means for me to challenge him to a duel. Itâ€™s silly talk and nothing
939987 [9111] else.â€
939987 [9112] 
939987 [9113] â€œHe will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the middle
939987 [9114] of the market-place,â€ cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.
939987 [9115] 
939987 [9116] â€œI did think of prosecuting him,â€ the captain went on, â€œbut look in our
939987 [9117] code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And then
939987 [9118] Agrafena Alexandrovna(3) sent for me and shouted at me: â€˜Donâ€™t dare to
939987 [9119] dream of it! If you proceed against him, Iâ€™ll publish it to all the world
939987 [9120] that he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.â€™ I
939987 [9121] call God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I
939987 [9122] acted, wasnâ€™t it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s? â€˜And whatâ€™s more,â€™
939987 [9123] she went on, â€˜Iâ€™ll dismiss you for good and youâ€™ll never earn another
939987 [9124] penny from me. Iâ€™ll speak to my merchant tooâ€™ (thatâ€™s what she calls her
939987 [9125] old man) â€˜and he will dismiss you!â€™ And if he dismisses me, what can I
939987 [9126] earn then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your
939987 [9127] Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another
939987 [9128] reason, but he means to make use of papers Iâ€™ve signed to go to law
939987 [9129] against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But now
939987 [9130] let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much? I didnâ€™t like to go into
939987 [9131] it in our mansion before him.â€
939987 [9132] 
939987 [9133] â€œYes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me as
939987 [9134] a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was throwing
939987 [9135] stones at his school-fellows! Itâ€™s very dangerous. They might kill him.
939987 [9136] They are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebodyâ€™s
939987 [9137] head.â€
939987 [9138] 
939987 [9139] â€œThatâ€™s just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to-day. Not
939987 [9140] on the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home crying
939987 [9141] and groaning and now he is ill.â€
939987 [9142] 
939987 [9143] â€œAnd you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on your
939987 [9144] account. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife not
939987 [9145] long ago.â€
939987 [9146] 
939987 [9147] â€œIâ€™ve heard about that too, itâ€™s dangerous. Krassotkin is an official
939987 [9148] here, we may hear more about it.â€
939987 [9149] 
939987 [9150] â€œI would advise you,â€ Alyosha went on warmly, â€œnot to send him to school
939987 [9151] at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is passed.â€
939987 [9152] 
939987 [9153] â€œAnger!â€ the captain repeated, â€œthatâ€™s just what it is. He is a little
939987 [9154] creature, but itâ€™s a mighty anger. You donâ€™t know all, sir. Let me tell
939987 [9155] you more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about the
939987 [9156] â€˜wisp of tow.â€™ Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are
939987 [9157] angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless.
939987 [9158] Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy,
939987 [9159] a weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his father, sir,
939987 [9160] but he stood up for his father against them all. For his father and for
939987 [9161] truth and justice. For what he suffered when he kissed your brotherâ€™s hand
939987 [9162] and cried to him â€˜Forgive father, forgive him,â€™â€”that only God knowsâ€”and I,
939987 [9163] his father. For our childrenâ€”not your children, but oursâ€”the children of
939987 [9164] the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every oneâ€”know what justice means,
939987 [9165] sir, even at nine years old. How should the rich know? They donâ€™t explore
939987 [9166] such depths once in their lives. But at that moment in the square when he
939987 [9167] kissed his hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice
939987 [9168] means. That truth entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,â€ the
939987 [9169] captain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right
939987 [9170] fist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how â€œthe truthâ€
939987 [9171] crushed Ilusha. â€œThat very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was
939987 [9172] delirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I
939987 [9173] noticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the
939987 [9174] window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mind
939987 [9175] was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful
939987 [9176] man as I am, and I donâ€™t remember much. Mamma began crying, tooâ€”I am very
939987 [9177] fond of mammaâ€”well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Donâ€™t
939987 [9178] despise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best
939987 [9179] men amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I donâ€™t remember
939987 [9180] about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at
939987 [9181] school. â€˜Wisp of tow,â€™ they shouted, â€˜your father was pulled out of the
939987 [9182] tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.â€™ â€
939987 [9183] 
939987 [9184] â€œOn the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale and
939987 [9185] wretched. â€˜What is it?â€™ I asked. He wouldnâ€™t answer. Well, thereâ€™s no
939987 [9186] talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it.
939987 [9187] Whatâ€™s more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara had
939987 [9188] begun snarling. â€˜You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything
939987 [9189] rational?â€™ â€˜Quite so,â€™ I said, â€˜can we ever do anything rational?â€™ For the
939987 [9190] time I turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a
939987 [9191] walk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same
939987 [9192] way, along which we are going nowâ€”from our gate to that great stone which
939987 [9193] lies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of the
939987 [9194] town pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along
939987 [9195] hand in hand as usual. He has a little hand, his fingers are thin and
939987 [9196] coldâ€”he suffers with his chest, you know. â€˜Father,â€™ said he, â€˜father!â€™
939987 [9197] â€˜Well?â€™ said I. I saw his eyes flashing. â€˜Father, how he treated you
939987 [9198] then!â€™ â€˜It canâ€™t be helped, Ilusha,â€™ I said. â€˜Donâ€™t forgive him, father,
939987 [9199] donâ€™t forgive him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for
939987 [9200] it.â€™ â€˜No, Ilusha,â€™ said I, â€˜I would not take money from him for anything.â€™
939987 [9201] Then he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it
939987 [9202] again. â€˜Father,â€™ he said, â€˜father, challenge him to a duel, at school they
939987 [9203] say you are a coward and wonâ€™t challenge him, and that youâ€™ll accept ten
939987 [9204] roubles from him.â€™ â€˜I canâ€™t challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,â€™ I answered.
939987 [9205] And I told briefly what Iâ€™ve just told you. He listened. â€˜Father,â€™ he
939987 [9206] said, â€˜anyway donâ€™t forgive it. When I grow up Iâ€™ll call him out myself
939987 [9207] and kill him.â€™ His eyes shone and glowed. And of course I am his father,
939987 [9208] and I had to put in a word: â€˜Itâ€™s a sin to kill,â€™ I said, â€˜even in a
939987 [9209] duel.â€™ â€˜Father,â€™ he said, â€˜when I grow up, Iâ€™ll knock him down, knock the
939987 [9210] sword out of his hand, Iâ€™ll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say:
939987 [9211] â€œI could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!â€ â€™ You see what the
939987 [9212] workings of his little mind have been during these two days; he must have
939987 [9213] been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.
939987 [9214] 
939987 [9215] â€œBut he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about it
939987 [9216] the day before yesterday, and you are right, I wonâ€™t send him to that
939987 [9217] school any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the class
939987 [9218] alone and defying them all, that his heart was full of resentment, of
939987 [9219] bitternessâ€”I was alarmed about him. We went for another walk. â€˜Father,â€™ he
939987 [9220] asked, â€˜are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?â€™ â€˜Yes,
939987 [9221] Ilusha,â€™ I said, â€˜there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.â€™
939987 [9222] â€˜Father,â€™ he said, â€˜I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer
939987 [9223] everybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one
939987 [9224] will dareâ€”â€™ Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling.
939987 [9225] â€˜Father,â€™ he said, â€˜what a horrid town this is.â€™ â€˜Yes, Ilusha,â€™ I said,
939987 [9226] â€˜it isnâ€™t a very nice town.â€™ â€˜Father, let us move into another town, a
939987 [9227] nice one,â€™ he said, â€˜where people donâ€™t know about us.â€™ â€˜We will move, we
939987 [9228] will, Ilusha,â€™ said I, â€˜only I must save up for it.â€™ I was glad to be able
939987 [9229] to turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we
939987 [9230] would move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. â€˜We will
939987 [9231] put mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and weâ€™ll walk,
939987 [9232] you shall have a lift now and then, and Iâ€™ll walk beside, for we must take
939987 [9233] care of our horse, we canâ€™t all ride. Thatâ€™s how weâ€™ll go.â€™ He was
939987 [9234] enchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and
939987 [9235] driving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We
939987 [9236] chattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind and
939987 [9237] comforted him.
939987 [9238] 
939987 [9239] â€œThat was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night
939987 [9240] everything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came back
939987 [9241] depressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the hand and
939987 [9242] we went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no
939987 [9243] sun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along,
939987 [9244] both of us depressed. â€˜Well, my boy,â€™ said I, â€˜how about our setting off
939987 [9245] on our travels?â€™ I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day
939987 [9246] before. He didnâ€™t answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand. Ah,
939987 [9247] I thought, itâ€™s a bad job; thereâ€™s something fresh. We had reached the
939987 [9248] stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And in the air there were
939987 [9249] lots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty in
939987 [9250] sight. Of course, itâ€™s just the season for the kites. â€˜Look, Ilusha,â€™ said
939987 [9251] I, â€˜itâ€™s time we got out our last yearâ€™s kite again. Iâ€™ll mend it, where
939987 [9252] have you put it away?â€™ My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned
939987 [9253] sideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell
939987 [9254] on me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You
939987 [9255] know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears
939987 [9256] when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall
939987 [9257] in streams. With those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face.
939987 [9258] He sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up
939987 [9259] against me as I sat on the stone. â€˜Father,â€™ he kept crying, â€˜dear father,
939987 [9260] how he insulted you!â€™ And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each otherâ€™s
939987 [9261] arms. â€˜Ilusha,â€™ I said to him, â€˜Ilusha darling.â€™ No one saw us then. God
939987 [9262] alone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your
939987 [9263] brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I wonâ€™t thrash my boy for your
939987 [9264] satisfaction.â€
939987 [9265] 
939987 [9266] He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha
939987 [9267] felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else
939987 [9268] in his, Alyoshaâ€™s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would
939987 [9269] not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart
939987 [9270] was trembling on the verge of tears.
939987 [9271] 
939987 [9272] â€œAh, how I would like to make friends with your boy!â€ he cried. â€œIf you
939987 [9273] could arrange itâ€”â€
939987 [9274] 
939987 [9275] â€œCertainly, sir,â€ muttered the captain.
939987 [9276] 
939987 [9277] â€œBut now listen to something quite different!â€ Alyosha went on. â€œI have a
939987 [9278] message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his
939987 [9279] betrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I
939987 [9280] have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for
939987 [9281] hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate
939987 [9282] position, she commissioned me at onceâ€”just nowâ€”to bring you this help from
939987 [9283] herâ€”but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor
939987 [9284] from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her!
939987 [9285] She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the
939987 [9286] same man. She thought of you only when she had just received a similar
939987 [9287] insult from himâ€”similar in its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister to
939987 [9288] help a brother in misfortune.... She told me to persuade you to take these
939987 [9289] two hundred roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in
939987 [9290] such need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander.
939987 [9291] There are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them
939987 [9292] unlessâ€”unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothers
939987 [9293] even on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, you
939987 [9294] must,â€ and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.
939987 [9295] 
939987 [9296] They were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence,
939987 [9297] and there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendous
939987 [9298] impression on the captain. He started, but at first only from
939987 [9299] astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he
939987 [9300] expected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from
939987 [9301] any oneâ€”and such a sum!
939987 [9302] 
939987 [9303] He took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer, quite
939987 [9304] a new expression came into his face.
939987 [9305] 
939987 [9306] â€œThat for me? So much moneyâ€”two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I
939987 [9307] havenâ€™t seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And she
939987 [9308] says she is a sister.... And is that the truth?â€
939987 [9309] 
939987 [9310] â€œI swear that all I told you is the truth,â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [9311] 
939987 [9312] The captain flushed red.
939987 [9313] 
939987 [9314] â€œListen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shanâ€™t be behaving like a
939987 [9315] scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shanâ€™t be a scoundrel? No,
939987 [9316] Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,â€ he hurried, touching Alyosha with
939987 [9317] both his hands. â€œYou are persuading me to take it, saying that itâ€™s a
939987 [9318] sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart wonâ€™t you feel contempt for
939987 [9319] me if I take it, eh?â€
939987 [9320] 
939987 [9321] â€œNo, no, on my salvation I swear I shanâ€™t! And no one will ever know but
939987 [9322] meâ€”I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.â€
939987 [9323] 
939987 [9324] â€œNever mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this
939987 [9325] you must listen, for you canâ€™t understand what these two hundred roubles
939987 [9326] mean to me now.â€ The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of
939987 [9327] incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown off his balance and
939987 [9328] talked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be allowed to say all
939987 [9329] he had to say.
939987 [9330] 
939987 [9331] â€œBesides its being honestly acquired from a â€˜sister,â€™ so highly respected
939987 [9332] and revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my
939987 [9333] hunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of
939987 [9334] his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. â€˜I can make
939987 [9335] nothing of it,â€™ said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept
939987 [9336] at a chemistâ€™s here. He said it would be sure to do her good, and he
939987 [9337] ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral water costs
939987 [9338] thirty copecks, and sheâ€™d need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I took
939987 [9339] the prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it
939987 [9340] lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them,
939987 [9341] morning and evening. But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion,
939987 [9342] without servants, without help, without a bath, and without water? Nina is
939987 [9343] rheumatic all over, I donâ€™t think I told you that. All her right side
939987 [9344] aches at night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel
939987 [9345] bears it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get,
939987 [9346] and sheâ€™ll only take the leavings, what youâ€™d scarcely give to a dog. â€˜I
939987 [9347] am not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,â€™ thatâ€™s
939987 [9348] what her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesnâ€™t like
939987 [9349] it. â€˜I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.â€™ As though she were not
939987 [9350] worth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness.
939987 [9351] Without her, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! She
939987 [9352] softens even Varvara. And donâ€™t judge Varvara harshly either, she is an
939987 [9353] angel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer,
939987 [9354] and she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to
939987 [9355] go back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took her
939987 [9356] money and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Though
939987 [9357] indeed she couldnâ€™t go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. She
939987 [9358] is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits on us
939987 [9359] all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma is
939987 [9360] capricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant with this
939987 [9361] money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the
939987 [9362] dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I can
939987 [9363] feed them properly. Good Lord, but itâ€™s a dream!â€
939987 [9364] 
939987 [9365] Alyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that the
939987 [9366] poor fellow had consented to be made happy.
939987 [9367] 
939987 [9368] â€œStay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,â€ the captain began to talk with frenzied
939987 [9369] rapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. â€œDo you know that Ilusha and I
939987 [9370] will perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, a
939987 [9371] black horse, he insists on its being black, and we will set off as we
939987 [9372] pretended the other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province,
939987 [9373] and I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go heâ€™d give me a
939987 [9374] place as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So Iâ€™d just
939987 [9375] put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and Iâ€™d walk, Iâ€™d
939987 [9376] walk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid thatâ€™s owing me,
939987 [9377] I should have perhaps enough for that too!â€
939987 [9378] 
939987 [9379] â€œThere would be enough!â€ cried Alyosha. â€œKaterina Ivanovna will send you
939987 [9380] as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what you
939987 [9381] want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it back
939987 [9382] later.... (Youâ€™ll get rich, youâ€™ll get rich!) And you know you couldnâ€™t
939987 [9383] have a better idea than to move to another province! It would be the
939987 [9384] saving of you, especially of your boyâ€”and you ought to go quickly, before
939987 [9385] the winter, before the cold. You must write to us when you are there, and
939987 [9386] we will always be brothers.... No, itâ€™s not a dream!â€
939987 [9387] 
939987 [9388] Alyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him he
939987 [9389] stopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and his
939987 [9390] lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving as
939987 [9391] though trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his lips
939987 [9392] moved. It was uncanny.
939987 [9393] 
939987 [9394] â€œWhat is it?â€ asked Alyosha, startled.
939987 [9395] 
939987 [9396] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,â€ muttered the captain, faltering,
939987 [9397] looking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate
939987 [9398] resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips. â€œI ...
939987 [9399] you, sir ... wouldnâ€™t you like me to show you a little trick I know?â€ he
939987 [9400] murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no longer
939987 [9401] faltering.
939987 [9402] 
939987 [9403] â€œWhat trick?â€
939987 [9404] 
939987 [9405] â€œA pretty trick,â€ whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted on the left
939987 [9406] side, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.
939987 [9407] 
939987 [9408] â€œWhat is the matter? What trick?â€ Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.
939987 [9409] 
939987 [9410] â€œWhy, look,â€ squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes
939987 [9411] which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger
939987 [9412] during the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them
939987 [9413] tight in his right hand. â€œDo you see, do you see?â€ he shrieked, pale and
939987 [9414] infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notes
939987 [9415] on the sand. â€œDo you see?â€ he shrieked again, pointing to them. â€œLook
939987 [9416] there!â€
939987 [9417] 
939987 [9418] And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping and
939987 [9419] exclaiming as he did so:
939987 [9420] 
939987 [9421] â€œSo much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money!
939987 [9422] So much for your money!â€
939987 [9423] 
939987 [9424] Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his whole
939987 [9425] figure expressed unutterable pride.
939987 [9426] 
939987 [9427] â€œTell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,â€ he
939987 [9428] cried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began to
939987 [9429] run; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and
939987 [9430] kissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turned
939987 [9431] round for the last time. This time his face was not contorted with
939987 [9432] laughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering,
939987 [9433] sobbing voice he cried:
939987 [9434] 
939987 [9435] â€œWhat should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?â€
939987 [9436] 
939987 [9437] And then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,
939987 [9438] inexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the man
939987 [9439] had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did not
939987 [9440] turn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and call him
939987 [9441] back, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two
939987 [9442] notes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into
939987 [9443] the sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha
939987 [9444] unfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he folded
939987 [9445] them up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on
939987 [9446] the success of her commission.

939987 [9455] Chapter I. The Engagement
939987 [9456] 
939987 [9457] 
939987 [9458] Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered;
939987 [9459] something important had happened. Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s hysterics had ended
939987 [9460] in a fainting fit, and then â€œa terrible, awful weakness had followed, she
939987 [9461] lay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever.
939987 [9462] They had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts were
939987 [9463] already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in
939987 [9464] her room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain
939987 [9465] fever!â€
939987 [9466] 
939987 [9467] Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. â€œThis is serious, serious,â€ she
939987 [9468] added at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before had
939987 [9469] been serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to
939987 [9470] describe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words. She
939987 [9471] had not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her
939987 [9472] there.
939987 [9473] 
939987 [9474] â€œLise,â€ she whispered almost in his ear, â€œLise has greatly surprised me
939987 [9475] just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heart
939987 [9476] forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began to
939987 [9477] be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though
939987 [9478] she was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry
939987 [9479] for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never
939987 [9480] been really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And
939987 [9481] you know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in
939987 [9482] earnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
939987 [9483] donâ€™t take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am never
939987 [9484] hard upon her, for sheâ€™s such a clever little thing. Would you believe it?
939987 [9485] She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, â€˜the greatest
939987 [9486] friend of her childhoodâ€™â€”just think of thatâ€”â€˜greatest friendâ€™â€”and what
939987 [9487] about me? She has very strong feelings and memories, and, whatâ€™s more, she
939987 [9488] uses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden
939987 [9489] when you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for
939987 [9490] instance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early
939987 [9491] childhood. Very likely itâ€™s standing there still; so thereâ€™s no need to
939987 [9492] speak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey
939987 [9493] Fyodorovitch, they donâ€™t change quickly. â€˜Mamma,â€™ she said, â€˜I remember
939987 [9494] this pine-tree as in a dream,â€™ only she said something so original about
939987 [9495] it that I canâ€™t repeat it. Besides, Iâ€™ve forgotten it. Well, good-by! I am
939987 [9496] so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, Iâ€™ve
939987 [9497] been out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as you
939987 [9498] always can so charmingly. Lise,â€ she cried, going to her door, â€œhere Iâ€™ve
939987 [9499] brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at all
939987 [9500] angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you could
939987 [9501] suppose so.â€
939987 [9502] 
939987 [9503] â€œ_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [9504] 
939987 [9505] Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed
939987 [9506] crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do
939987 [9507] in such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as though
939987 [9508] they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.
939987 [9509] 
939987 [9510] â€œMamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey
939987 [9511] Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told
939987 [9512] me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know,
939987 [9513] although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to
939987 [9514] another ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the money and how
939987 [9515] is that poor man getting on?â€
939987 [9516] 
939987 [9517] â€œThe fact is I didnâ€™t give it to him, and itâ€™s a long story,â€ answered
939987 [9518] Alyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret at
939987 [9519] having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away, and
939987 [9520] that he, too, was trying to talk of other things.
939987 [9521] 
939987 [9522] Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the
939987 [9523] first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Liseâ€™s
939987 [9524] attention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of the
939987 [9525] strong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling his
939987 [9526] story well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been fond of
939987 [9527] coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him, what
939987 [9528] he had read, or what he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had
939987 [9529] made day-dreams and woven whole romances togetherâ€”generally cheerful and
939987 [9530] amusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in
939987 [9531] Moscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyosha
939987 [9532] described Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how the
939987 [9533] luckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her hands
939987 [9534] and crying out:
939987 [9535] 
939987 [9536] â€œSo you didnâ€™t give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, you
939987 [9537] ought to have run after him!â€
939987 [9538] 
939987 [9539] â€œNo, Lise; itâ€™s better I didnâ€™t run after him,â€ said Alyosha, getting up
939987 [9540] from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.
939987 [9541] 
939987 [9542] â€œHow so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is
939987 [9543] hopeless?â€
939987 [9544] 
939987 [9545] â€œNot hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them. Heâ€™ll
939987 [9546] take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to take it,â€ said
939987 [9547] Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. â€œYou see, Lise,â€ he went on,
939987 [9548] stopping suddenly before her, â€œI made one blunder, but that, even that, is
939987 [9549] all for the best.â€
939987 [9550] 
939987 [9551] â€œWhat blunder, and why is it for the best?â€
939987 [9552] 
939987 [9553] â€œIâ€™ll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he has
939987 [9554] suffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why he took
939987 [9555] offense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did not
939987 [9556] know that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now that there
939987 [9557] was a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise in
939987 [9558] his position.... To begin with, he was sore at having been so glad of the
939987 [9559] money in my presence and not having concealed it from me. If he had been
939987 [9560] pleased, but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun
939987 [9561] affecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take
939987 [9562] money, he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinely
939987 [9563] delighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful
939987 [9564] manâ€”thatâ€™s the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, his
939987 [9565] voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept laughing
939987 [9566] such a laugh, or perhaps he was cryingâ€”yes, I am sure he was crying, he
939987 [9567] was so delightedâ€”and he talked about his daughtersâ€”and about the situation
939987 [9568] he could get in another town.... And when he had poured out his heart, he
939987 [9569] felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to
939987 [9570] hate me at once. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What
939987 [9571] had made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and
939987 [9572] accepted me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried
939987 [9573] to intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing
939987 [9574] me; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came to
939987 [9575] feel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very important
939987 [9576] one. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to
939987 [9577] another town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give
939987 [9578] him as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once.
939987 [9579] Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise,
939987 [9580] itâ€™s awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look
939987 [9581] at him as though they were his benefactors.... Iâ€™ve heard that; Father
939987 [9582] Zossima told me so. I donâ€™t know how to put it, but I have often seen it
939987 [9583] myself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of it was that
939987 [9584] though he did not know, up to the very last minute, that he would trample
939987 [9585] on the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that.
939987 [9586] Thatâ€™s just what made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment....
939987 [9587] And though itâ€™s so dreadful, itâ€™s all for the best. In fact, I believe
939987 [9588] nothing better could have happened.â€
939987 [9589] 
939987 [9590] â€œWhy, why could nothing better have happened?â€ cried Lise, looking with
939987 [9591] great surprise at Alyosha.
939987 [9592] 
939987 [9593] â€œBecause if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he
939987 [9594] would be crying with mortification, thatâ€™s just what would have happened.
939987 [9595] And most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps have
939987 [9596] flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now. But now
939987 [9597] he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he knows he has
939987 [9598] â€˜ruined himself.â€™ So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept
939987 [9599] the two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his
939987 [9600] honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot.... He couldnâ€™t
939987 [9601] know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yet
939987 [9602] he is in terrible need of that money. Though he is proud of himself now,
939987 [9603] yet even to-day heâ€™ll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will think
939987 [9604] of it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning
939987 [9605] he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. Itâ€™s just then that Iâ€™ll
939987 [9606] appear. â€˜Here, you are a proud man,â€™ I shall say: â€˜you have shown it; but
939987 [9607] now take the money and forgive us!â€™ And then he will take it!â€
939987 [9608] 
939987 [9609] Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, â€œAnd then
939987 [9610] he will take it!â€ Lise clapped her hands.
939987 [9611] 
939987 [9612] â€œAh, thatâ€™s true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you
939987 [9613] know all this? So young and yet he knows whatâ€™s in the heart.... I should
939987 [9614] never have worked it out.â€
939987 [9615] 
939987 [9616] â€œThe great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing
939987 [9617] with us, in spite of his taking money from us,â€ Alyosha went on in his
939987 [9618] excitement, â€œand not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.â€
939987 [9619] 
939987 [9620] â€œ â€˜On a higher footingâ€™ is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, go
939987 [9621] on!â€
939987 [9622] 
939987 [9623] â€œYou mean there isnâ€™t such an expression as â€˜on a higher footingâ€™; but
939987 [9624] that doesnâ€™t matter becauseâ€”â€
939987 [9625] 
939987 [9626] â€œOh, no, of course it doesnâ€™t matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You
939987 [9627] know, I scarcely respected you till nowâ€”that is I respected you but on an
939987 [9628] equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing.
939987 [9629] Donâ€™t be angry, dear, at my joking,â€ she put in at once, with strong
939987 [9630] feeling. â€œI am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, Alexey
939987 [9631] Fyodorovitch. Isnâ€™t there in all our analysisâ€”I mean your analysis ... no,
939987 [9632] better call it oursâ€”arenâ€™t we showing contempt for him, for that poor
939987 [9633] manâ€”in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? In
939987 [9634] deciding so certainly that he will take the money?â€
939987 [9635] 
939987 [9636] â€œNo, Lise, itâ€™s not contempt,â€ Alyosha answered, as though he had prepared
939987 [9637] himself for the question. â€œI was thinking of that on the way here. How can
939987 [9638] it be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all just the same as
939987 [9639] he is? For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, we
939987 [9640] should have been just the same in his place.... I donâ€™t know about you,
939987 [9641] Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul
939987 [9642] is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have
939987 [9643] no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care for
939987 [9644] most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one
939987 [9645] would for the sick in hospitals.â€
939987 [9646] 
939987 [9647] â€œAh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the
939987 [9648] sick!â€
939987 [9649] 
939987 [9650] â€œLet us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. I
939987 [9651] am sometimes very impatient and at other times I donâ€™t see things. Itâ€™s
939987 [9652] different with you.â€
939987 [9653] 
939987 [9654] â€œAh, I donâ€™t believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!â€
939987 [9655] 
939987 [9656] â€œI am so glad you say so, Lise.â€
939987 [9657] 
939987 [9658] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sort
939987 [9659] of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door,
939987 [9660] open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,â€ said Lise, in a
939987 [9661] nervous, hurried whisper.
939987 [9662] 
939987 [9663] Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.
939987 [9664] 
939987 [9665] â€œCome here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ Lise went on, flushing redder and
939987 [9666] redder. â€œGive me your handâ€”thatâ€™s right. I have to make a great
939987 [9667] confession, I didnâ€™t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,â€ and
939987 [9668] she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly
939987 [9669] ashamed of the confession.
939987 [9670] 
939987 [9671] Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.
939987 [9672] 
939987 [9673] â€œAh, Lise, what a good thing!â€ cried Alyosha joyfully. â€œYou know, I was
939987 [9674] perfectly sure you were in earnest.â€
939987 [9675] 
939987 [9676] â€œSure? Upon my word!â€ She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it,
939987 [9677] blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. â€œI kiss his hand and he
939987 [9678] says, â€˜What a good thing!â€™ â€
939987 [9679] 
939987 [9680] But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.
939987 [9681] 
939987 [9682] â€œI should like to please you always, Lise, but I donâ€™t know how to do it,â€
939987 [9683] he muttered, blushing too.
939987 [9684] 
939987 [9685] â€œAlyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as his
939987 [9686] wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What a
939987 [9687] thing to say! Why, thatâ€™s impertinenceâ€”thatâ€™s what it is.â€
939987 [9688] 
939987 [9689] â€œWhy, was it wrong of me to feel sure?â€ Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly.
939987 [9690] 
939987 [9691] â€œAh, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,â€ cried Lise,
939987 [9692] looking tenderly and happily at him.
939987 [9693] 
939987 [9694] Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down and
939987 [9695] kissed her on her lips.
939987 [9696] 
939987 [9697] â€œOh, what are you doing?â€ cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.
939987 [9698] 
939987 [9699] â€œOh, forgive me if I shouldnâ€™t.... Perhaps Iâ€™m awfully stupid.... You said
939987 [9700] I was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.â€
939987 [9701] 
939987 [9702] Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. â€œAnd in that dress!â€ she
939987 [9703] ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing and
939987 [9704] became serious, almost stern.
939987 [9705] 
939987 [9706] â€œAlyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and we
939987 [9707] shall have a long time to wait,â€ she ended suddenly. â€œTell me rather why
939987 [9708] you who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a little
939987 [9709] idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I donâ€™t
939987 [9710] deserve you a bit.â€
939987 [9711] 
939987 [9712] â€œYou do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days.
939987 [9713] If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. _He_ told me to marry,
939987 [9714] too. Whom could I marry better than youâ€”and who would have me except you?
939987 [9715] I have been thinking it over. In the first place, youâ€™ve known me from a
939987 [9716] child and youâ€™ve a great many qualities I havenâ€™t. You are more
939987 [9717] light-hearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. I
939987 [9718] have been brought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah, you
939987 [9719] donâ€™t know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do
939987 [9720] laugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do.
939987 [9721] You laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr.â€
939987 [9722] 
939987 [9723] â€œLike a martyr? How?â€
939987 [9724] 
939987 [9725] â€œYes, Lise, your question just now: whether we werenâ€™t showing contempt
939987 [9726] for that poor man by dissecting his soulâ€”that was the question of a
939987 [9727] sufferer.... You see, I donâ€™t know how to express it, but any one who
939987 [9728] thinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your invalid
939987 [9729] chair you must have thought over many things already.â€
939987 [9730] 
939987 [9731] â€œAlyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?â€ murmured Lise in
939987 [9732] a failing voice, weak with happiness. â€œListen, Alyosha. What will you wear
939987 [9733] when you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Donâ€™t laugh, donâ€™t
939987 [9734] be angry, itâ€™s very, very important to me.â€
939987 [9735] 
939987 [9736] â€œI havenâ€™t thought about the suit, Lise; but Iâ€™ll wear whatever you like.â€
939987 [9737] 
939987 [9738] â€œI should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piquÃ©
939987 [9739] waistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I
939987 [9740] didnâ€™t care for you when I said I didnâ€™t mean what I wrote?â€
939987 [9741] 
939987 [9742] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t believe it.â€
939987 [9743] 
939987 [9744] â€œOh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.â€
939987 [9745] 
939987 [9746] â€œYou see, I knew that youâ€”seemed to care for me, but I pretended to
939987 [9747] believe that you didnâ€™t care for me to make itâ€”easier for you.â€
939987 [9748] 
939987 [9749] â€œThat makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully
939987 [9750] fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I
939987 [9751] decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly
939987 [9752] and gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean
939987 [9753] that you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply a
939987 [9754] stupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the
939987 [9755] letter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as
939987 [9756] not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it,
939987 [9757] wasnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [9758] 
939987 [9759] â€œAh, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this
939987 [9760] morning, in this pocket. Here it is.â€
939987 [9761] 
939987 [9762] Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance.
939987 [9763] 
939987 [9764] â€œBut I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.â€
939987 [9765] 
939987 [9766] â€œWhy, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!â€
939987 [9767] 
939987 [9768] â€œI told a lie if you like,â€ Alyosha laughed, too. â€œI told a lie so as not
939987 [9769] to give you back the letter. Itâ€™s very precious to me,â€ he added suddenly,
939987 [9770] with strong feeling, and again he flushed. â€œIt always will be, and I wonâ€™t
939987 [9771] give it up to any one!â€
939987 [9772] 
939987 [9773] Lise looked at him joyfully. â€œAlyosha,â€ she murmured again, â€œlook at the
939987 [9774] door. Isnâ€™t mamma listening?â€
939987 [9775] 
939987 [9776] â€œVery well, Lise, Iâ€™ll look; but wouldnâ€™t it be better not to look? Why
939987 [9777] suspect your mother of such meanness?â€
939987 [9778] 
939987 [9779] â€œWhat meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, itâ€™s her right, itâ€™s
939987 [9780] not meanness!â€ cried Lise, firing up. â€œYou may be sure, Alexey
939987 [9781] Fyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself I
939987 [9782] shall certainly spy on her!â€
939987 [9783] 
939987 [9784] â€œReally, Lise? Thatâ€™s not right.â€
939987 [9785] 
939987 [9786] â€œOh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were listening
939987 [9787] to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness, but when her
939987 [9788] own daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you know
939987 [9789] I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married, and let me tell you I
939987 [9790] shall open all your letters and read them, so you may as well be
939987 [9791] prepared.â€
939987 [9792] 
939987 [9793] â€œYes, of course, if soâ€”â€ muttered Alyosha, â€œonly itâ€™s not right.â€
939987 [9794] 
939987 [9795] â€œAh, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we wonâ€™t quarrel the very first day.
939987 [9796] Iâ€™d better tell you the whole truth. Of course, itâ€™s very wrong to spy on
939987 [9797] people, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall spy on
939987 [9798] you all the same.â€
939987 [9799] 
939987 [9800] â€œDo, then; you wonâ€™t find out anything,â€ laughed Alyosha.
939987 [9801] 
939987 [9802] â€œAnd, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.â€
939987 [9803] 
939987 [9804] â€œI shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most
939987 [9805] important things. Even if you donâ€™t agree with me, I shall do my duty in
939987 [9806] the most important things.â€
939987 [9807] 
939987 [9808] â€œThatâ€™s right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only
939987 [9809] in the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready to vow to
939987 [9810] do so nowâ€”in everything, and for all my life!â€ cried Lise fervently, â€œand
939987 [9811] Iâ€™ll do it gladly, gladly! Whatâ€™s more, Iâ€™ll swear never to spy on you,
939987 [9812] never once, never to read one of your letters. For you are right and I am
939987 [9813] not. And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I wonâ€™t do
939987 [9814] it since you consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now....
939987 [9815] Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad latelyâ€”both
939987 [9816] yesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but I
939987 [9817] see you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?â€
939987 [9818] 
939987 [9819] â€œYes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,â€ answered Alyosha mournfully. â€œI see
939987 [9820] you love me, since you guessed that.â€
939987 [9821] 
939987 [9822] â€œWhat grief? What about? Can you tell me?â€ asked Lise with timid entreaty.
939987 [9823] 
939987 [9824] â€œIâ€™ll tell you later, Liseâ€”afterwards,â€ said Alyosha, confused. â€œNow you
939987 [9825] wouldnâ€™t understand it perhapsâ€”and perhaps I couldnâ€™t explain it.â€
939987 [9826] 
939987 [9827] â€œI know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.â€
939987 [9828] 
939987 [9829] â€œYes, my brothers too,â€ murmured Alyosha, pondering.
939987 [9830] 
939987 [9831] â€œI donâ€™t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,â€ said Lise suddenly.
939987 [9832] 
939987 [9833] He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.
939987 [9834] 
939987 [9835] â€œMy brothers are destroying themselves,â€ he went on, â€œmy father, too. And
939987 [9836] they are destroying others with them. Itâ€™s â€˜the primitive force of the
939987 [9837] Karamazovs,â€™ as Father PaÃ¯ssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled,
939987 [9838] earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I
939987 [9839] donâ€™t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk!
939987 [9840] Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.â€
939987 [9841] 
939987 [9842] â€œYes, I did.â€
939987 [9843] 
939987 [9844] â€œAnd perhaps I donâ€™t even believe in God.â€
939987 [9845] 
939987 [9846] â€œYou donâ€™t believe? What is the matter?â€ said Lise quietly and gently. But
939987 [9847] Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective
939987 [9848] in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing
939987 [9849] him.
939987 [9850] 
939987 [9851] â€œAnd now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is
939987 [9852] going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am
939987 [9853] with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise....
939987 [9854] For the future we will be together.â€
939987 [9855] 
939987 [9856] â€œYes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all
939987 [9857] our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.â€
939987 [9858] 
939987 [9859] Alyosha kissed her.
939987 [9860] 
939987 [9861] â€œCome, now go. Christ be with you!â€ and she made the sign of the cross
939987 [9862] over him. â€œMake haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see Iâ€™ve kept you
939987 [9863] cruelly. Iâ€™ll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy!
939987 [9864] Shall we be happy, shall we?â€
939987 [9865] 
939987 [9866] â€œI believe we shall, Lise.â€
939987 [9867] 
939987 [9868] Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going
939987 [9869] out of the house without saying good-by to her. But no sooner had he
939987 [9870] opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From
939987 [9871] the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to
939987 [9872] meet him.
939987 [9873] 
939987 [9874] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and
939987 [9875] ridiculous. I trust you wonâ€™t dreamâ€”Itâ€™s foolishness, nothing but
939987 [9876] foolishness!â€ she said, attacking him at once.
939987 [9877] 
939987 [9878] â€œOnly donâ€™t tell her that,â€ said Alyosha, â€œor she will be upset, and
939987 [9879] thatâ€™s bad for her now.â€
939987 [9880] 
939987 [9881] â€œSensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you
939987 [9882] only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you
939987 [9883] didnâ€™t want to irritate her by contradiction?â€
939987 [9884] 
939987 [9885] â€œOh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,â€ Alyosha declared
939987 [9886] stoutly.
939987 [9887] 
939987 [9888] â€œTo be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first place
939987 [9889] I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you may
939987 [9890] be sure of that.â€
939987 [9891] 
939987 [9892] â€œBut why?â€ asked Alyosha. â€œItâ€™s all so far off. We may have to wait
939987 [9893] another year and a half.â€
939987 [9894] 
939987 [9895] â€œAh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, thatâ€™s true, of course, and youâ€™ll have time to
939987 [9896] quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am so
939987 [9897] unhappy! Though itâ€™s such nonsense, itâ€™s a great blow to me. I feel like
939987 [9898] Famusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky and she
939987 [9899] is Sofya, and, only fancy, Iâ€™ve run down to meet you on the stairs, and in
939987 [9900] the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I
939987 [9901] almost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her
939987 [9902] hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother.
939987 [9903] I might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still,
939987 [9904] what is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!â€
939987 [9905] 
939987 [9906] â€œNo, thereâ€™s no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.â€
939987 [9907] 
939987 [9908] â€œShe still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her aunts
939987 [9909] are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs.
939987 [9910] Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didnâ€™t know what to do for
939987 [9911] him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home in
939987 [9912] my carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! Itâ€™s true
939987 [9913] nothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all thatâ€™s holy,
939987 [9914] in the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
939987 [9915] Iâ€™m her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.â€
939987 [9916] 
939987 [9917] â€œNo, I wonâ€™t show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldnâ€™t. I am
939987 [9918] coming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but now
939987 [9919] good-by!â€
939987 [9920] 
939987 [9921] And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.
939987 [9922] 
939987 [9923] 
939987 [9924] 
939987 [9925] Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar
939987 [9926] 
939987 [9927] 
939987 [9928] He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-by to Lise,
939987 [9929] the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his
939987 [9930] brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting
939987 [9931] late, nearly three oâ€™clock. Alyoshaâ€™s whole soul turned to the monastery,
939987 [9932] to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed
939987 [9933] everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about
939987 [9934] to happen grew stronger in Alyoshaâ€™s mind with every hour. What that
939987 [9935] catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he
939987 [9936] could perhaps not have said definitely. â€œEven if my benefactor must die
939987 [9937] without me, anyway I wonâ€™t have to reproach myself all my life with the
939987 [9938] thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and
939987 [9939] hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great
939987 [9940] precept.â€
939987 [9941] 
939987 [9942] His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the
939987 [9943] fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the
939987 [9944] summer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not
939987 [9945] announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain
939987 [9946] hidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If,
939987 [9947] as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be
939987 [9948] very likely to come to the summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, give
939987 [9949] much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even
939987 [9950] if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.
939987 [9951] 
939987 [9952] Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost
939987 [9953] in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-house
939987 [9954] unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the house and Foma
939987 [9955] too, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and obey his
939987 [9956] instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden, or might
939987 [9957] warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.
939987 [9958] 
939987 [9959] There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait.
939987 [9960] He looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him as a great deal
939987 [9961] more ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, it
939987 [9962] seemed a wretched little place this time. There was a circle on the table,
939987 [9963] left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before.
939987 [9964] Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in
939987 [9965] a time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat down
939987 [9966] precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat. At last
939987 [9967] he felt very depressedâ€”depressed by suspense and uncertainty. But he had
939987 [9968] not sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly heard the
939987 [9969] thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close. People were sitting, or had only
939987 [9970] just sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away.
939987 [9971] Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the
939987 [9972] day before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among
939987 [9973] the bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it
939987 [9974] now. Who were they?
939987 [9975] 
939987 [9976] A manâ€™s voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying
939987 [9977] himself on the guitar:
939987 [9978] 
939987 [9979] 
939987 [9980]     With invincible force
939987 [9981]     I am bound to my dear.
939987 [9982]     O Lord, have mercy
939987 [9983]     On her and on me!
939987 [9984]     On her and on me!
939987 [9985]     On her and on me!
939987 [9986] 
939987 [9987] 
939987 [9988] The voice ceased. It was a lackeyâ€™s tenor and a lackeyâ€™s song. Another
939987 [9989] voice, a womanâ€™s, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though with
939987 [9990] mincing affectation:
939987 [9991] 
939987 [9992] â€œWhy havenâ€™t you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why do
939987 [9993] you always look down upon us?â€
939987 [9994] 
939987 [9995] â€œNot at all,â€ answered a manâ€™s voice politely, but with emphatic dignity.
939987 [9996] It was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the woman
939987 [9997] was making advances. â€œI believe the man must be Smerdyakov,â€ thought
939987 [9998] Alyosha, â€œfrom his voice. And the lady must be the daughter of the house
939987 [9999] here, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail
939987 [10000] and goes to Marfa for soup.â€
939987 [10001] 
939987 [10002] â€œI am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,â€ the womanâ€™s
939987 [10003] voice continued. â€œWhy donâ€™t you go on?â€
939987 [10004] 
939987 [10005] The man sang again:
939987 [10006] 
939987 [10007] 
939987 [10008]     What do I care for royal wealth
939987 [10009]     If but my dear one be in health?
939987 [10010]     Lord have mercy
939987 [10011]     On her and on me!
939987 [10012]     On her and on me!
939987 [10013]     On her and on me!
939987 [10014] 
939987 [10015] 
939987 [10016] â€œIt was even better last time,â€ observed the womanâ€™s voice. â€œYou sang â€˜If
939987 [10017] my darling be in healthâ€™; it sounded more tender. I suppose youâ€™ve
939987 [10018] forgotten to-day.â€
939987 [10019] 
939987 [10020] â€œPoetry is rubbish!â€ said Smerdyakov curtly.
939987 [10021] 
939987 [10022] â€œOh, no! I am very fond of poetry.â€
939987 [10023] 
939987 [10024] â€œSo far as itâ€™s poetry, itâ€™s essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who
939987 [10025] ever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though it
939987 [10026] were decreed by government, we shouldnâ€™t say much, should we? Poetry is no
939987 [10027] good, Marya Kondratyevna.â€
939987 [10028] 
939987 [10029] â€œHow clever you are! How is it youâ€™ve gone so deep into everything?â€ The
939987 [10030] womanâ€™s voice was more and more insinuating.
939987 [10031] 
939987 [10032] â€œI could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, if
939987 [10033] it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have shot a
939987 [10034] man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy
939987 [10035] beggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my teeth in
939987 [10036] Moscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.
939987 [10037] Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but I
939987 [10038] would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not
939987 [10039] have come into the world at all. They used to say in the market, and your
939987 [10040] mamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair
939987 [10041] was like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a wee
939987 [10042] bit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said â€˜a little bit,â€™ like
939987 [10043] every one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasantâ€™s
939987 [10044] feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with an
939987 [10045] educated man? He canâ€™t be said to have feeling at all, in his ignorance.
939987 [10046] From my childhood up when I hear â€˜a wee bit,â€™ I am ready to burst with
939987 [10047] rage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.â€
939987 [10048] 
939987 [10049] â€œIf youâ€™d been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldnâ€™t have
939987 [10050] talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.â€
939987 [10051] 
939987 [10052] â€œI donâ€™t want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, whatâ€™s more, I
939987 [10053] should like to abolish all soldiers.â€
939987 [10054] 
939987 [10055] â€œAnd when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?â€
939987 [10056] 
939987 [10057] â€œThereâ€™s no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia
939987 [10058] by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, and
939987 [10059] it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A clever nation
939987 [10060] would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We should have had
939987 [10061] quite different institutions.â€
939987 [10062] 
939987 [10063] â€œAre they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldnâ€™t
939987 [10064] change a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,â€ observed Marya
939987 [10065] Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a most
939987 [10066] languishing glance.
939987 [10067] 
939987 [10068] â€œThatâ€™s as one prefers.â€
939987 [10069] 
939987 [10070] â€œBut you are just like a foreignerâ€”just like a most gentlemanly foreigner.
939987 [10071] I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.â€
939987 [10072] 
939987 [10073] â€œIf you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in
939987 [10074] their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished
939987 [10075] boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russian
939987 [10076] people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday,
939987 [10077] though he is mad, and all his children.â€
939987 [10078] 
939987 [10079] â€œYou said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [10080] 
939987 [10081] â€œBut he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly. He
939987 [10082] is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have left
939987 [10083] here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his
939987 [10084] behavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesnâ€™t know how to do
939987 [10085] anything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only a
939987 [10086] soup-maker, but with luck I could open a cafÃ© restaurant in Petrovka, in
939987 [10087] Moscow, for my cookery is something special, and thereâ€™s no one in Moscow,
939987 [10088] except the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special. Dmitri
939987 [10089] Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of the first
939987 [10090] count in the country, heâ€™d fight him. Though in what way is he better than
939987 [10091] I am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has
939987 [10092] wasted without any need!â€
939987 [10093] 
939987 [10094] â€œIt must be lovely, a duel,â€ Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.
939987 [10095] 
939987 [10096] â€œHow so?â€
939987 [10097] 
939987 [10098] â€œIt must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers with
939987 [10099] pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady. A
939987 [10100] perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, Iâ€™d give
939987 [10101] anything to see one!â€
939987 [10102] 
939987 [10103] â€œItâ€™s all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is firing
939987 [10104] straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. Youâ€™d be glad to run
939987 [10105] away, Marya Kondratyevna.â€
939987 [10106] 
939987 [10107] â€œYou donâ€™t mean you would run away?â€ But Smerdyakov did not deign to
939987 [10108] reply. After a momentâ€™s silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sang
939987 [10109] again in the same falsetto:
939987 [10110] 
939987 [10111] 
939987 [10112]     Whatever you may say,
939987 [10113]     I shall go far away.
939987 [10114]     Life will be bright and gay
939987 [10115]     In the city far away.
939987 [10116]     I shall not grieve,
939987 [10117]     I shall not grieve at all,
939987 [10118]     I donâ€™t intend to grieve at all.
939987 [10119] 
939987 [10120] 
939987 [10121] Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were
939987 [10122] silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakov
939987 [10123] dressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhaps
939987 [10124] curled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His companion was the daughter
939987 [10125] of the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long. She
939987 [10126] was young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was so
939987 [10127] round and terribly freckled.
939987 [10128] 
939987 [10129] â€œWill my brother Dmitri soon be back?â€ asked Alyosha with as much
939987 [10130] composure as he could.
939987 [10131] 
939987 [10132] Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.
939987 [10133] 
939987 [10134] â€œHow am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Itâ€™s not as if I were his
939987 [10135] keeper,â€ answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.
939987 [10136] 
939987 [10137] â€œBut I simply asked whether you do know?â€ Alyosha explained.
939987 [10138] 
939987 [10139] â€œI know nothing of his whereabouts and donâ€™t want to.â€
939987 [10140] 
939987 [10141] â€œBut my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the
939987 [10142] house, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.â€
939987 [10143] 
939987 [10144] Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.
939987 [10145] 
939987 [10146] â€œAnd how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?â€
939987 [10147] he asked, looking at Alyosha.
939987 [10148] 
939987 [10149] â€œI came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to the
939987 [10150] summer-house. I hope youâ€™ll forgive me,â€ he added, addressing Marya
939987 [10151] Kondratyevna. â€œI was in a hurry to find my brother.â€
939987 [10152] 
939987 [10153] â€œAch, as though we could take it amiss in you!â€ drawled Marya
939987 [10154] Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyoshaâ€™s apology. â€œFor Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [10155] often goes to the summer-house in that way. We donâ€™t know he is here and
939987 [10156] he is sitting in the summer-house.â€
939987 [10157] 
939987 [10158] â€œI am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now.
939987 [10159] Believe me, itâ€™s on business of great importance to him.â€
939987 [10160] 
939987 [10161] â€œHe never tells us,â€ lisped Marya Kondratyevna.
939987 [10162] 
939987 [10163] â€œThough I used to come here as a friend,â€ Smerdyakov began again, â€œDmitri
939987 [10164] Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant
939987 [10165] questions about the master. â€˜What news?â€™ heâ€™ll ask. â€˜Whatâ€™s going on in
939987 [10166] there now? Whoâ€™s coming and going?â€™ and canâ€™t I tell him something more.
939987 [10167] Twice already heâ€™s threatened me with death.â€
939987 [10168] 
939987 [10169] â€œWith death?â€ Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.
939987 [10170] 
939987 [10171] â€œDo you suppose heâ€™d think much of that, with his temper, which you had a
939987 [10172] chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let Agrafena
939987 [10173] Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, Iâ€™ll be the first to
939987 [10174] suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more
939987 [10175] afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what he
939987 [10176] might not do!â€
939987 [10177] 
939987 [10178] â€œHis honor said to him the other day, â€˜Iâ€™ll pound you in a mortar!â€™ â€
939987 [10179] added Marya Kondratyevna.
939987 [10180] 
939987 [10181] â€œOh, if itâ€™s pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,â€ observed Alyosha.
939987 [10182] â€œIf I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.â€
939987 [10183] 
939987 [10184] â€œWell, the only thing I can tell you is this,â€ said Smerdyakov, as though
939987 [10185] thinking better of it; â€œI am here as an old friend and neighbor, and it
939987 [10186] would be odd if I didnâ€™t come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent
939987 [10187] me first thing this morning to your brotherâ€™s lodging in Lake Street,
939987 [10188] without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine
939987 [10189] with him at the restaurant here, in the market-place. I went, but didnâ€™t
939987 [10190] find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight oâ€™clock. â€˜Heâ€™s been
939987 [10191] here, but he is quite gone,â€™ those were the very words of his landlady.
939987 [10192] Itâ€™s as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this
939987 [10193] moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan
939987 [10194] Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone
939987 [10195] an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not
939987 [10196] to speak of me and of what I have told you, for heâ€™d kill me for nothing
939987 [10197] at all.â€
939987 [10198] 
939987 [10199] â€œBrother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?â€ repeated Alyosha
939987 [10200] quickly.
939987 [10201] 
939987 [10202] â€œThatâ€™s so.â€
939987 [10203] 
939987 [10204] â€œThe Metropolis tavern in the market-place?â€
939987 [10205] 
939987 [10206] â€œThe very same.â€
939987 [10207] 
939987 [10208] â€œThatâ€™s quite likely,â€ cried Alyosha, much excited. â€œThank you,
939987 [10209] Smerdyakov; thatâ€™s important. Iâ€™ll go there at once.â€
939987 [10210] 
939987 [10211] â€œDonâ€™t betray me,â€ Smerdyakov called after him.
939987 [10212] 
939987 [10213] â€œOh, no, Iâ€™ll go to the tavern as though by chance. Donâ€™t be anxious.â€
939987 [10214] 
939987 [10215] â€œBut wait a minute, Iâ€™ll open the gate to you,â€ cried Marya Kondratyevna.
939987 [10216] 
939987 [10217] â€œNo; itâ€™s a short cut, Iâ€™ll get over the fence again.â€
939987 [10218] 
939987 [10219] What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the
939987 [10220] tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic
939987 [10221] dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them
939987 [10222] down. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his
939987 [10223] brother Ivan called down to him from it.
939987 [10224] 
939987 [10225] â€œAlyosha, canâ€™t you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.â€
939987 [10226] 
939987 [10227] â€œTo be sure I can, only I donâ€™t quite know whether in this dressâ€”â€
939987 [10228] 
939987 [10229] â€œBut I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; Iâ€™ll run down to meet you.â€
939987 [10230] 
939987 [10231] A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone
939987 [10232] dining.
939987 [10233] 
939987 [10234] 
939987 [10235] 
939987 [10236] Chapter III. The Brothers Make Friends
939987 [10237] 
939987 [10238] 
939987 [10239] Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by
939987 [10240] a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was the
939987 [10241] first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters were
939987 [10242] continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an
939987 [10243] old retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual
939987 [10244] bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for
939987 [10245] the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the
939987 [10246] drone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this
939987 [10247] tavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he
939987 [10248] reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.
939987 [10249] 
939987 [10250] â€œShall I order you fish, soup or anything. You donâ€™t live on tea alone, I
939987 [10251] suppose,â€ cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha.
939987 [10252] He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.
939987 [10253] 
939987 [10254] â€œLet me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,â€ said Alyosha gayly.
939987 [10255] 
939987 [10256] â€œAnd cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love
939987 [10257] cherry jam when you were little?â€
939987 [10258] 
939987 [10259] â€œYou remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.â€
939987 [10260] 
939987 [10261] Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.
939987 [10262] 
939987 [10263] â€œI remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I
939987 [10264] was nearly fifteen. Thereâ€™s such a difference between fifteen and eleven
939987 [10265] that brothers are never companions at those ages. I donâ€™t know whether I
939987 [10266] was fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years I
939987 [10267] never thought of you at all. Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we
939987 [10268] only met once somewhere, I believe. And now Iâ€™ve been here more than three
939987 [10269] months, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I
939987 [10270] am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see you
939987 [10271] to say good-by and just then you passed.â€
939987 [10272] 
939987 [10273] â€œWere you very anxious to see me, then?â€
939987 [10274] 
939987 [10275] â€œVery. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me.
939987 [10276] And then to say good-by. I believe itâ€™s always best to get to know people
939987 [10277] just before leaving them. Iâ€™ve noticed how youâ€™ve been looking at me these
939987 [10278] three months. There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes,
939987 [10279] and I canâ€™t endure that. Thatâ€™s how it is Iâ€™ve kept away from you. But in
939987 [10280] the end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I
939987 [10281] thought. Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, donâ€™t you?
939987 [10282] I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if
939987 [10283] they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy
939987 [10284] me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love
939987 [10285] me for some reason, Alyosha?â€
939987 [10286] 
939987 [10287] â€œI do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of youâ€”Ivan is a tomb! I say of you,
939987 [10288] Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand
939987 [10289] something in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.â€
939987 [10290] 
939987 [10291] â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ laughed Ivan.
939987 [10292] 
939987 [10293] â€œYou wonâ€™t be angry?â€ Alyosha laughed too.
939987 [10294] 
939987 [10295] â€œWell?â€
939987 [10296] 
939987 [10297] â€œThat you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that
939987 [10298] you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have I
939987 [10299] insulted you dreadfully?â€
939987 [10300] 
939987 [10301] â€œOn the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,â€ cried Ivan, warmly and
939987 [10302] good-humoredly. â€œWould you believe it that ever since that scene with her,
939987 [10303] I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as
939987 [10304] though you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know Iâ€™ve been sitting
939987 [10305] here thinking to myself: that if I didnâ€™t believe in life, if I lost faith
939987 [10306] in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in
939987 [10307] fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden
939987 [10308] chaos, if I were struck by every horror of manâ€™s disillusionmentâ€”still I
939987 [10309] should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn
939987 [10310] away from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure to
939987 [10311] leave the cup, even if Iâ€™ve not emptied it, and turn awayâ€”where I donâ€™t
939987 [10312] know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over
939987 [10313] everythingâ€”every disillusionment, every disgust with life. Iâ€™ve asked
939987 [10314] myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would
939987 [10315] overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and Iâ€™ve
939987 [10316] come to the conclusion that there isnâ€™t, that is till I am thirty, and
939987 [10317] then I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive
939987 [10318] moralistsâ€”and poets especiallyâ€”often call that thirst for life base. Itâ€™s
939987 [10319] a feature of the Karamazovs, itâ€™s true, that thirst for life regardless of
939987 [10320] everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal
939987 [10321] force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing
939987 [10322] for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe
939987 [10323] in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they
939987 [10324] open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves
939987 [10325] you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by
939987 [10326] men, though Iâ€™ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old
939987 [10327] habit oneâ€™s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you,
939987 [10328] eat it, it will do you good. Itâ€™s first-rate soup, they know how to make
939987 [10329] it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here.
939987 [10330] And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but itâ€™s a most
939987 [10331] precious graveyard, thatâ€™s what it is! Precious are the dead that lie
939987 [10332] there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of
939987 [10333] such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their
939987 [10334] science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and
939987 [10335] weep over them; though Iâ€™m convinced in my heart that itâ€™s long been
939987 [10336] nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply
939987 [10337] because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion.
939987 [10338] I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue skyâ€”thatâ€™s all it is. Itâ€™s
939987 [10339] not a matter of intellect or logic, itâ€™s loving with oneâ€™s inside, with
939987 [10340] oneâ€™s stomach. One loves the first strength of oneâ€™s youth. Do you
939987 [10341] understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?â€ Ivan laughed suddenly.
939987 [10342] 
939987 [10343] â€œI understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with oneâ€™s inside, with
939987 [10344] oneâ€™s stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have
939987 [10345] such a longing for life,â€ cried Alyosha. â€œI think every one should love
939987 [10346] life above everything in the world.â€
939987 [10347] 
939987 [10348] â€œLove life more than the meaning of it?â€
939987 [10349] 
939987 [10350] â€œCertainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless
939987 [10351] of logic, and itâ€™s only then one will understand the meaning of it. I have
939987 [10352] thought so a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan, you love life, now
939987 [10353] youâ€™ve only to try to do the second half and you are saved.â€
939987 [10354] 
939987 [10355] â€œYou are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does your
939987 [10356] second half mean?â€
939987 [10357] 
939987 [10358] â€œWhy, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all.
939987 [10359] Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.â€
939987 [10360] 
939987 [10361] â€œI see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such _professions de
939987 [10362] foi_ from suchâ€”novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it true
939987 [10363] that you mean to leave the monastery?â€
939987 [10364] 
939987 [10365] â€œYes, my elder sends me out into the world.â€
939987 [10366] 
939987 [10367] â€œWe shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I am
939987 [10368] thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesnâ€™t want
939987 [10369] to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of hanging on to
939987 [10370] eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too seriously, though he is a
939987 [10371] buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he stands on his sensualityâ€”though
939987 [10372] after we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on.... But
939987 [10373] to hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain â€˜a
939987 [10374] shadow of nobilityâ€™ by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?â€
939987 [10375] 
939987 [10376] â€œNo, but I saw Smerdyakov,â€ and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,
939987 [10377] described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously and
939987 [10378] questioned him.
939987 [10379] 
939987 [10380] â€œBut he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,â€ added
939987 [10381] Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.
939987 [10382] 
939987 [10383] â€œAre you frowning on Smerdyakovâ€™s account?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [10384] 
939987 [10385] â€œYes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but
939987 [10386] now thereâ€™s no need,â€ said Ivan reluctantly.
939987 [10387] 
939987 [10388] â€œBut are you really going so soon, brother?â€
939987 [10389] 
939987 [10390] â€œYes.â€
939987 [10391] 
939987 [10392] â€œWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?â€ asked Alyosha anxiously.
939987 [10393] 
939987 [10394] â€œYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my
939987 [10395] brother Dmitriâ€™s keeper?â€ Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly
939987 [10396] smiled bitterly. â€œCainâ€™s answer about his murdered brother, wasnâ€™t it?
939987 [10397] Perhaps thatâ€™s what youâ€™re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I
939987 [10398] canâ€™t stay here to be their keeper, can I? Iâ€™ve finished what I had to do,
939987 [10399] and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that Iâ€™ve been
939987 [10400] trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?
939987 [10401] Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished
939987 [10402] it just now, you were witness.â€
939987 [10403] 
939987 [10404] â€œAt Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s?â€
939987 [10405] 
939987 [10406] â€œYes, and Iâ€™ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to
939987 [10407] do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesnâ€™t come in. I had my own business to settle
939987 [10408] with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as
939987 [10409] though there was an understanding between us. I didnâ€™t ask him to do it,
939987 [10410] but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. Itâ€™s all
939987 [10411] too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would
939987 [10412] you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering
939987 [10413] champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! Itâ€™s been going on
939987 [10414] nearly six months, and all at once Iâ€™ve thrown it off. I could never have
939987 [10415] guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I
939987 [10416] wanted.â€
939987 [10417] 
939987 [10418] â€œYou are speaking of your love, Ivan?â€
939987 [10419] 
939987 [10420] â€œOf my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried
939987 [10421] myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all at
939987 [10422] once itâ€™s collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went
939987 [10423] away and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, itâ€™s the literal
939987 [10424] truth.â€
939987 [10425] 
939987 [10426] â€œYou seem very merry about it now,â€ observed Alyosha, looking into his
939987 [10427] face, which had suddenly grown brighter.
939987 [10428] 
939987 [10429] â€œBut how could I tell that I didnâ€™t care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears
939987 [10430] after all I didnâ€™t. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she was
939987 [10431] just now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully
939987 [10432] even now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?â€
939987 [10433] 
939987 [10434] â€œNo, only perhaps it wasnâ€™t love.â€
939987 [10435] 
939987 [10436] â€œAlyosha,â€ laughed Ivan, â€œdonâ€™t make reflections about love, itâ€™s unseemly
939987 [10437] for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! Iâ€™ve forgotten
939987 [10438] to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly was sitting
939987 [10439] by a â€˜laceration.â€™ Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not
939987 [10440] Dmitri,â€ Ivan insisted gayly. â€œHer feeling for Dmitri was simply a
939987 [10441] self-laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worst
939987 [10442] of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she
939987 [10443] doesnâ€™t care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she
939987 [10444] may never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, itâ€™s
939987 [10445] better so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What
939987 [10446] happened after I departed?â€
939987 [10447] 
939987 [10448] Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard,
939987 [10449] unconscious and delirious.
939987 [10450] 
939987 [10451] â€œIsnâ€™t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?â€
939987 [10452] 
939987 [10453] â€œI think not.â€
939987 [10454] 
939987 [10455] â€œI must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They donâ€™t matter. God
939987 [10456] gave woman hysterics as a relief. I wonâ€™t go to her at all. Why push
939987 [10457] myself forward again?â€
939987 [10458] 
939987 [10459] â€œBut you told her that she had never cared for you.â€
939987 [10460] 
939987 [10461] â€œI did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us
939987 [10462] drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!â€
939987 [10463] 
939987 [10464] â€œNo, brother, we had better not drink,â€ said Alyosha suddenly. â€œBesides I
939987 [10465] feel somehow depressed.â€
939987 [10466] 
939987 [10467] â€œYes, youâ€™ve been depressed a long time, Iâ€™ve noticed it.â€
939987 [10468] 
939987 [10469] â€œHave you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?â€
939987 [10470] 
939987 [10471] â€œMorning? I didnâ€™t say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it may
939987 [10472] be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid
939987 [10473] dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long ago, so
939987 [10474] far as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my going away?
939987 [10475] Weâ€™ve plenty of time before I go, an eternity!â€
939987 [10476] 
939987 [10477] â€œIf you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?â€
939987 [10478] 
939987 [10479] â€œBut what does it matter to us?â€ laughed Ivan. â€œWeâ€™ve time enough for our
939987 [10480] talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why
939987 [10481] have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man
939987 [10482] and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the
939987 [10483] Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?â€
939987 [10484] 
939987 [10485] â€œNo.â€
939987 [10486] 
939987 [10487] â€œThen you know what for. Itâ€™s different for other people; but we in our
939987 [10488] green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. Thatâ€™s what
939987 [10489] we care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternal
939987 [10490] questions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practical
939987 [10491] questions. Why have you been looking at me in expectation for the last
939987 [10492] three months? To ask me, â€˜What do you believe, or donâ€™t you believe at
939987 [10493] all?â€™ Thatâ€™s what your eyes have been meaning for these three months,
939987 [10494] havenâ€™t they?â€
939987 [10495] 
939987 [10496] â€œPerhaps so,â€ smiled Alyosha. â€œYou are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?â€
939987 [10497] 
939987 [10498] â€œMe laughing! I donâ€™t want to wound my little brother who has been
939987 [10499] watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look straight
939987 [10500] at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not a
939987 [10501] novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, I
939987 [10502] mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit down
939987 [10503] in a corner. Theyâ€™ve never met in their lives before and, when they go out
939987 [10504] of the tavern, they wonâ€™t meet again for forty years. And what do they
939987 [10505] talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions,
939987 [10506] of the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe in
939987 [10507] God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanity
939987 [10508] on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same, theyâ€™re the same
939987 [10509] questions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most original
939987 [10510] Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions! Isnâ€™t it so?â€
939987 [10511] 
939987 [10512] â€œYes, for real Russians the questions of Godâ€™s existence and of
939987 [10513] immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come
939987 [10514] first and foremost, of course, and so they should,â€ said Alyosha, still
939987 [10515] watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.
939987 [10516] 
939987 [10517] â€œWell, Alyosha, itâ€™s sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but
939987 [10518] anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can
939987 [10519] hardly imagine. But thereâ€™s one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully
939987 [10520] fond of.â€
939987 [10521] 
939987 [10522] â€œHow nicely you put that in!â€ Alyosha laughed suddenly.
939987 [10523] 
939987 [10524] â€œWell, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God,
939987 [10525] eh?â€
939987 [10526] 
939987 [10527] â€œBegin where you like. You declared yesterday at fatherâ€™s that there was
939987 [10528] no God.â€ Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.
939987 [10529] 
939987 [10530] â€œI said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your
939987 [10531] eyes glow. But now Iâ€™ve no objection to discussing with you, and I say so
939987 [10532] very seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have no
939987 [10533] friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept God,â€
939987 [10534] laughed Ivan; â€œthatâ€™s a surprise for you, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [10535] 
939987 [10536] â€œYes, of course, if you are not joking now.â€
939987 [10537] 
939987 [10538] â€œJoking? I was told at the elderâ€™s yesterday that I was joking. You know,
939987 [10539] dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared
939987 [10540] that, if there were no God, he would have to be invented. _Sâ€™il nâ€™existait
939987 [10541] pas Dieu, il faudrait lâ€™inventer._ And man has actually invented God. And
939987 [10542] whatâ€™s strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really
939987 [10543] exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God,
939987 [10544] could enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it
939987 [10545] is, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me,
939987 [10546] Iâ€™ve long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And I
939987 [10547] wonâ€™t go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject,
939987 [10548] all derived from European hypotheses; for whatâ€™s a hypothesis there, is an
939987 [10549] axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their
939987 [10550] teachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys
939987 [10551] themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming at
939987 [10552] now? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature,
939987 [10553] that is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope,
939987 [10554] thatâ€™s it, isnâ€™t it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply.
939987 [10555] But you must note this: if God exists and if He really did create the
939987 [10556] world, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of
939987 [10557] Euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in
939987 [10558] space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,
939987 [10559] and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole
939987 [10560] universe, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created in
939987 [10561] Euclidâ€™s geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which
939987 [10562] according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in
939987 [10563] infinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I canâ€™t understand
939987 [10564] even that, I canâ€™t expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly
939987 [10565] that I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian
939987 [10566] earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world?
939987 [10567] And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha,
939987 [10568] especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are
939987 [10569] utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three
939987 [10570] dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and whatâ€™s more, I accept
939987 [10571] His wisdom, His purposeâ€”which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the
939987 [10572] underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony
939987 [10573] in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to
939987 [10574] Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was â€˜with God,â€™ and Which
939987 [10575] Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of
939987 [10576] phrases for it. I seem to be on the right path, donâ€™t I? Yet would you
939987 [10577] believe it, in the final result I donâ€™t accept this world of Godâ€™s, and,
939987 [10578] although I know it exists, I donâ€™t accept it at all. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t
939987 [10579] accept God, you must understand, itâ€™s the world created by Him I donâ€™t and
939987 [10580] cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that suffering
939987 [10581] will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of
939987 [10582] human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the
939987 [10583] despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind
939987 [10584] of man, that in the worldâ€™s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony,
939987 [10585] something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all
939987 [10586] hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all
939987 [10587] the crimes of humanity, of all the blood theyâ€™ve shed; that it will make
939987 [10588] it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with
939987 [10589] menâ€”but though all that may come to pass, I donâ€™t accept it. I wonâ€™t
939987 [10590] accept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see
939987 [10591] it and say that theyâ€™ve met, but still I wonâ€™t accept it. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s at
939987 [10592] the root of me, Alyosha; thatâ€™s my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I
939987 [10593] began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but Iâ€™ve led up to my
939987 [10594] confession, for thatâ€™s all you want. You didnâ€™t want to hear about God,
939987 [10595] but only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so Iâ€™ve told
939987 [10596] you.â€
939987 [10597] 
939987 [10598] Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.
939987 [10599] 
939987 [10600] â€œAnd why did you begin â€˜as stupidly as you couldâ€™?â€ asked Alyosha, looking
939987 [10601] dreamily at him.
939987 [10602] 
939987 [10603] â€œTo begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on
939987 [10604] such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And secondly,
939987 [10605] the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is,
939987 [10606] the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence
939987 [10607] wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is
939987 [10608] honest and straightforward. Iâ€™ve led the conversation to my despair, and
939987 [10609] the more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.â€
939987 [10610] 
939987 [10611] â€œYou will explain why you donâ€™t accept the world?â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [10612] 
939987 [10613] â€œTo be sure I will, itâ€™s not a secret, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been leading up
939987 [10614] to. Dear little brother, I donâ€™t want to corrupt you or to turn you from
939987 [10615] your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.â€ Ivan smiled suddenly
939987 [10616] quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile on
939987 [10617] his face before.
939987 [10618] 
939987 [10619] 
939987 [10620] 
939987 [10621] Chapter IV. Rebellion
939987 [10622] 
939987 [10623] 
939987 [10624] â€œI must make you one confession,â€ Ivan began. â€œI could never understand
939987 [10625] how one can love oneâ€™s neighbors. Itâ€™s just oneâ€™s neighbors, to my mind,
939987 [10626] that one canâ€™t love, though one might love those at a distance. I once
939987 [10627] read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen
939987 [10628] beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and
939987 [10629] began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some
939987 [10630] awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from â€˜self-laceration,â€™
939987 [10631] from the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed
939987 [10632] by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must be
939987 [10633] hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.â€
939987 [10634] 
939987 [10635] â€œFather Zossima has talked of that more than once,â€ observed Alyosha; â€œhe,
939987 [10636] too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced
939987 [10637] in love, from loving him. But yet thereâ€™s a great deal of love in mankind,
939987 [10638] and almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.â€
939987 [10639] 
939987 [10640] â€œWell, I know nothing of it so far, and canâ€™t understand it, and the
939987 [10641] innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether
939987 [10642] thatâ€™s due to menâ€™s bad qualities or whether itâ€™s inherent in their
939987 [10643] nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible
939987 [10644] on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer
939987 [10645] intensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is another
939987 [10646] and not I. And whatâ€™s more, a man is rarely ready to admit anotherâ€™s
939987 [10647] suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why wonâ€™t he admit it, do you
939987 [10648] think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I
939987 [10649] once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering;
939987 [10650] degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles meâ€”hunger, for
939987 [10651] instanceâ€”my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher
939987 [10652] sufferingâ€”for an idea, for instanceâ€”he will very rarely admit that,
939987 [10653] perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man
939987 [10654] should have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of
939987 [10655] his favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially
939987 [10656] genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity
939987 [10657] through the newspapers. One can love oneâ€™s neighbors in the abstract, or
939987 [10658] even at a distance, but at close quarters itâ€™s almost impossible. If it
939987 [10659] were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear
939987 [10660] silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then
939987 [10661] one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But
939987 [10662] enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to
939987 [10663] speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine
939987 [10664] ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my
939987 [10665] argument to a tenth of what it would be. Still weâ€™d better keep to the
939987 [10666] children, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children
939987 [10667] can be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when
939987 [10668] they are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second
939987 [10669] reason why I wonâ€™t speak of grown-up people is that, besides being
939987 [10670] disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensationâ€”theyâ€™ve eaten
939987 [10671] the apple and know good and evil, and they have become â€˜like gods.â€™ They
939987 [10672] go on eating it still. But the children havenâ€™t eaten anything, and are so
939987 [10673] far innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you
939987 [10674] will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer
939987 [10675] horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathersâ€™ sins, they must be
939987 [10676] punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning
939987 [10677] is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on
939987 [10678] earth. The innocent must not suffer for anotherâ€™s sins, and especially
939987 [10679] such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond
939987 [10680] of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious,
939987 [10681] the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they
939987 [10682] are quite littleâ€”up to seven, for instanceâ€”are so remote from grown-up
939987 [10683] people; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.
939987 [10684] I knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a
939987 [10685] burglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when he
939987 [10686] was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time
939987 [10687] at his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He
939987 [10688] trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends
939987 [10689] with him.... You donâ€™t know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My
939987 [10690] head aches and I am sad.â€
939987 [10691] 
939987 [10692] â€œYou speak with a strange air,â€ observed Alyosha uneasily, â€œas though you
939987 [10693] were not quite yourself.â€
939987 [10694] 
939987 [10695] â€œBy the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,â€ Ivan went on, seeming
939987 [10696] not to hear his brotherâ€™s words, â€œtold me about the crimes committed by
939987 [10697] Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general
939987 [10698] rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and
939987 [10699] children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them
939987 [10700] so till morning, and in the morning they hang themâ€”all sorts of things you
939987 [10701] canâ€™t imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but thatâ€™s a
939987 [10702] great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as
939987 [10703] a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, thatâ€™s all
939987 [10704] he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he
939987 [10705] were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children,
939987 [10706] too; cutting the unborn child from the motherâ€™s womb, and tossing babies
939987 [10707] up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before
939987 [10708] their mothersâ€™ eyes. Doing it before the mothersâ€™ eyes was what gave zest
939987 [10709] to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.
939987 [10710] Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading
939987 [10711] Turks around her. Theyâ€™ve planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to
939987 [10712] make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points
939987 [10713] a pistol four inches from the babyâ€™s face. The baby laughs with glee,
939987 [10714] holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the
939987 [10715] babyâ€™s face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasnâ€™t it? By the way,
939987 [10716] Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.â€
939987 [10717] 
939987 [10718] â€œBrother, what are you driving at?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [10719] 
939987 [10720] â€œI think if the devil doesnâ€™t exist, but man has created him, he has
939987 [10721] created him in his own image and likeness.â€
939987 [10722] 
939987 [10723] â€œJust as he did God, then?â€ observed Alyosha.
939987 [10724] 
939987 [10725] â€œ â€˜Itâ€™s wonderful how you can turn words,â€™ as Polonius says in _Hamlet_,â€
939987 [10726] laughed Ivan. â€œYou turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours must
939987 [10727] be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and likeness. You asked
939987 [10728] just now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond of collecting certain
939987 [10729] facts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort
939987 [10730] from newspapers and books, and Iâ€™ve already got a fine collection. The
939987 [10731] Turks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have
939987 [10732] specimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we
939987 [10733] prefer beatingâ€”rods and scourgesâ€”thatâ€™s our national institution. Nailing
939987 [10734] ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod
939987 [10735] and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us.
939987 [10736] Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws
939987 [10737] have been passed, so that they donâ€™t dare to flog men now. But they make
939987 [10738] up for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that it
939987 [10739] would be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being
939987 [10740] inoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.
939987 [10741] I have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,
939987 [10742] quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executedâ€”a young
939987 [10743] man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the
939987 [10744] Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimate
939987 [10745] child who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on
939987 [10746] the Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up like
939987 [10747] a little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and
939987 [10748] scarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock
939987 [10749] in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite
939987 [10750] the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been
939987 [10751] given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of
939987 [10752] feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like the
939987 [10753] Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to the
939987 [10754] pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldnâ€™t even give him that,
939987 [10755] and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent all
939987 [10756] his childhood and his youth, till he grew up and was strong enough to go
939987 [10757] away and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day laborer
939987 [10758] in Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by
939987 [10759] killing and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to
939987 [10760] death. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was
939987 [10761] immediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods,
939987 [10762] philanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in
939987 [10763] prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon
939987 [10764] him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his
939987 [10765] crime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a
939987 [10766] monster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace.
939987 [10767] All Geneva was in excitement about himâ€”all philanthropic and religious
939987 [10768] Geneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to
939987 [10769] the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; â€˜You are our brother, you
939987 [10770] have found grace.â€™ And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, â€˜Yes,
939987 [10771] Iâ€™ve found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigsâ€™ food, but
939987 [10772] now even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.â€™ â€˜Yes, Richard, die
939987 [10773] in the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though itâ€™s not your fault
939987 [10774] that you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigsâ€™ food and were
939987 [10775] beaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing is
939987 [10776] forbidden); but youâ€™ve shed blood and you must die.â€™ And on the last day,
939987 [10777] Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute:
939987 [10778] â€˜This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ cry the pastors
939987 [10779] and the judges and philanthropic ladies. â€˜This is the happiest day of your
939987 [10780] life, for you are going to the Lord!â€™ They all walk or drive to the
939987 [10781] scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call to
939987 [10782] Richard: â€˜Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!â€™
939987 [10783] And so, covered with his brothersâ€™ kisses, Richard is dragged on to the
939987 [10784] scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head in
939987 [10785] brotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, thatâ€™s characteristic.
939987 [10786] That pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists
939987 [10787] of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed
939987 [10788] gratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is
939987 [10789] interesting because itâ€™s national. Though to us itâ€™s absurd to cut off a
939987 [10790] manâ€™s head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet we
939987 [10791] have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical pastime is
939987 [10792] the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov
939987 [10793] describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, â€˜on its meek eyes,â€™
939987 [10794] every one must have seen it. Itâ€™s peculiarly Russian. He describes how a
939987 [10795] feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move.
939987 [10796] The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what
939987 [10797] he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over
939987 [10798] and over again. â€˜However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.â€™
939987 [10799] The nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature
939987 [10800] on its weeping, on its â€˜meek eyes.â€™ The frantic beast tugs and draws the
939987 [10801] load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort
939987 [10802] of unnatural spasmodic actionâ€”itâ€™s awful in Nekrassov. But thatâ€™s only a
939987 [10803] horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught
939987 [10804] us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can
939987 [10805] be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own
939987 [10806] child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it.
939987 [10807] The papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. â€˜It stings more,â€™
939987 [10808] said he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there
939987 [10809] are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal
939987 [10810] sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. They
939987 [10811] beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more
939987 [10812] savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps,
939987 [10813] â€˜Daddy! daddy!â€™ By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought
939987 [10814] into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a
939987 [10815] barrister â€˜a conscience for hire.â€™ The counsel protests in his clientâ€™s
939987 [10816] defense. â€˜Itâ€™s such a simple thing,â€™ he says, â€˜an everyday domestic event.
939987 [10817] A father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought into
939987 [10818] court.â€™ The jury, convinced by him, give a favorable verdict. The public
939987 [10819] roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasnâ€™t
939987 [10820] there! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor!
939987 [10821] Charming pictures.
939987 [10822] 
939987 [10823] â€œBut Iâ€™ve still better things about children. Iâ€™ve collected a great,
939987 [10824] great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of
939987 [10825] five who was hated by her father and mother, â€˜most worthy and respectable
939987 [10826] people, of good education and breeding.â€™ You see, I must repeat again, it
939987 [10827] is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing
939987 [10828] children, and children only. To all other types of humanity these
939987 [10829] torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane
939987 [10830] Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of
939987 [10831] children themselves in that sense. Itâ€™s just their defenselessness that
939987 [10832] tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no
939987 [10833] refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of
939987 [10834] course, a demon lies hiddenâ€”the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat
939987 [10835] at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off
939987 [10836] the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney
939987 [10837] disease, and so on.
939987 [10838] 
939987 [10839] â€œThis poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those
939987 [10840] cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason
939987 [10841] till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of
939987 [10842] crueltyâ€”shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and
939987 [10843] because she didnâ€™t ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five
939987 [10844] sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they
939987 [10845] smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her
939987 [10846] mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor
939987 [10847] childâ€™s groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who canâ€™t even
939987 [10848] understand whatâ€™s done to her, should beat her little aching heart with
939987 [10849] her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful
939987 [10850] tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and
939987 [10851] brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy
939987 [10852] must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have
939987 [10853] existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he
939987 [10854] know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole
939987 [10855] world of knowledge is not worth that childâ€™s prayer to â€˜dear, kind Godâ€™! I
939987 [10856] say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the
939987 [10857] apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am
939987 [10858] making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. Iâ€™ll leave off if you
939987 [10859] like.â€
939987 [10860] 
939987 [10861] â€œNever mind. I want to suffer too,â€ muttered Alyosha.
939987 [10862] 
939987 [10863] â€œOne picture, only one more, because itâ€™s so curious, so characteristic,
939987 [10864] and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities.
939987 [10865] Iâ€™ve forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was in the darkest days of
939987 [10866] serfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of
939987 [10867] the People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections,
939987 [10868] the owner of great estates, one of those menâ€”somewhat exceptional, I
939987 [10869] believe, even thenâ€”who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure,
939987 [10870] are convinced that theyâ€™ve earned absolute power over the lives of their
939987 [10871] subjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his
939987 [10872] property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor
939987 [10873] neighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of
939987 [10874] hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boysâ€”all mounted, and in
939987 [10875] uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in
939987 [10876] play and hurt the paw of the generalâ€™s favorite hound. â€˜Why is my favorite
939987 [10877] dog lame?â€™ He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dogâ€™s paw.
939987 [10878] â€˜So you did it.â€™ The general looked the child up and down. â€˜Take him.â€™ He
939987 [10879] was takenâ€”taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that
939987 [10880] morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his
939987 [10881] dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting
939987 [10882] parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of
939987 [10883] them all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from the
939987 [10884] lock-up. Itâ€™s a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting.
939987 [10885] The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked.
939987 [10886] He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... â€˜Make him run,â€™
939987 [10887] commands the general. â€˜Run! run!â€™ shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... â€˜At
939987 [10888] him!â€™ yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the
939987 [10889] child. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his motherâ€™s
939987 [10890] eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of
939987 [10891] administering his estates. Wellâ€”what did he deserve? To be shot? To be
939987 [10892] shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!â€
939987 [10893] 
939987 [10894] â€œTo be shot,â€ murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale,
939987 [10895] twisted smile.
939987 [10896] 
939987 [10897] â€œBravo!â€ cried Ivan, delighted. â€œIf even you say so.... Youâ€™re a pretty
939987 [10898] monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha
939987 [10899] Karamazov!â€
939987 [10900] 
939987 [10901] â€œWhat I said was absurd, butâ€”â€
939987 [10902] 
939987 [10903] â€œThatâ€™s just the point, that â€˜butâ€™!â€ cried Ivan. â€œLet me tell you, novice,
939987 [10904] that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on
939987 [10905] absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without
939987 [10906] them. We know what we know!â€
939987 [10907] 
939987 [10908] â€œWhat do you know?â€
939987 [10909] 
939987 [10910] â€œI understand nothing,â€ Ivan went on, as though in delirium. â€œI donâ€™t want
939987 [10911] to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind
939987 [10912] long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be
939987 [10913] false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.â€
939987 [10914] 
939987 [10915] â€œWhy are you trying me?â€ Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. â€œWill you
939987 [10916] say what you mean at last?â€
939987 [10917] 
939987 [10918] â€œOf course, I will; thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been leading up to. You are dear to
939987 [10919] me, I donâ€™t want to let you go, and I wonâ€™t give you up to your Zossima.â€
939987 [10920] 
939987 [10921] Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.
939987 [10922] 
939987 [10923] â€œListen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of the
939987 [10924] other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to
939987 [10925] its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. I
939987 [10926] am a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why the
939987 [10927] world is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they
939987 [10928] were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven,
939987 [10929] though they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity
939987 [10930] them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is
939987 [10931] that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows
939987 [10932] effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its levelâ€”but
939987 [10933] thatâ€™s only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I canâ€™t consent to live
939987 [10934] by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause
939987 [10935] follows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?â€”I must have
939987 [10936] justice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite
939987 [10937] time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have
939987 [10938] believed in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise
939987 [10939] again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I
939987 [10940] havenâ€™t suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure
939987 [10941] the soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my
939987 [10942] own eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and
939987 [10943] embrace his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly
939987 [10944] understands what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are
939987 [10945] built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the
939987 [10946] children, and what am I to do about them? Thatâ€™s a question I canâ€™t
939987 [10947] answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions,
939987 [10948] but Iâ€™ve only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so
939987 [10949] unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal
939987 [10950] harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? Itâ€™s beyond
939987 [10951] all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the
939987 [10952] harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the
939987 [10953] harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. I
939987 [10954] understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such
939987 [10955] solidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must share
939987 [10956] responsibility for all their fathersâ€™ crimes, such a truth is not of this
939987 [10957] world and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that
939987 [10958] the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didnâ€™t grow
939987 [10959] up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I
939987 [10960] am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the
939987 [10961] universe it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in one
939987 [10962] hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: â€˜Thou
939987 [10963] art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.â€™ When the mother embraces the
939987 [10964] fiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears,
939987 [10965] â€˜Thou art just, O Lord!â€™ then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be
939987 [10966] reached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I
939987 [10967] canâ€™t accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take
939987 [10968] my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I
939987 [10969] live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry
939987 [10970] aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the childâ€™s torturer,
939987 [10971] â€˜Thou art just, O Lord!â€™ but I donâ€™t want to cry aloud then. While there
939987 [10972] is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher
939987 [10973] harmony altogether. Itâ€™s not worth the tears of that one tortured child
939987 [10974] who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its
939987 [10975] stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to â€˜dear, kind Godâ€™! Itâ€™s not
939987 [10976] worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for,
939987 [10977] or there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them?
939987 [10978] Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging
939987 [10979] them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do,
939987 [10980] since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of
939987 [10981] harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I donâ€™t
939987 [10982] want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum
939987 [10983] of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that
939987 [10984] the truth is not worth such a price. I donâ€™t want the mother to embrace
939987 [10985] the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let
939987 [10986] her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for
939987 [10987] the immeasurable suffering of her motherâ€™s heart. But the sufferings of
939987 [10988] her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the
939987 [10989] torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if
939987 [10990] they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole
939987 [10991] world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I
939987 [10992] donâ€™t want harmony. From love for humanity I donâ€™t want it. I would rather
939987 [10993] be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my
939987 [10994] unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_.
939987 [10995] Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; itâ€™s beyond our means to
939987 [10996] pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance
939987 [10997] ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as
939987 [10998] possible. And that I am doing. Itâ€™s not God that I donâ€™t accept, Alyosha,
939987 [10999] only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.â€
939987 [11000] 
939987 [11001] â€œThatâ€™s rebellion,â€ murmured Alyosha, looking down.
939987 [11002] 
939987 [11003] â€œRebellion? I am sorry you call it that,â€ said Ivan earnestly. â€œOne can
939987 [11004] hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I
939987 [11005] challenge youâ€”answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human
939987 [11006] destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace
939987 [11007] and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to
939987 [11008] death only one tiny creatureâ€”that baby beating its breast with its fist,
939987 [11009] for instanceâ€”and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you
939987 [11010] consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the
939987 [11011] truth.â€
939987 [11012] 
939987 [11013] â€œNo, I wouldnâ€™t consent,â€ said Alyosha softly.
939987 [11014] 
939987 [11015] â€œAnd can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would
939987 [11016] agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood
939987 [11017] of a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?â€
939987 [11018] 
939987 [11019] â€œNo, I canâ€™t admit it. Brother,â€ said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing
939987 [11020] eyes, â€œyou said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would
939987 [11021] have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and He
939987 [11022] can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent
939987 [11023] blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built
939987 [11024] the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, â€˜Thou art just, O Lord, for
939987 [11025] Thy ways are revealed!â€™ â€
939987 [11026] 
939987 [11027] â€œAh! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; on
939987 [11028] the contrary Iâ€™ve been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring
939987 [11029] Him in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in the
939987 [11030] foreground. Do you know, Alyoshaâ€”donâ€™t laugh! I made a poem about a year
939987 [11031] ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, Iâ€™ll tell it to you.â€
939987 [11032] 
939987 [11033] â€œYou wrote a poem?â€
939987 [11034] 
939987 [11035] â€œOh, no, I didnâ€™t write it,â€ laughed Ivan, â€œand Iâ€™ve never written two
939987 [11036] lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I
939987 [11037] remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first
939987 [11038] readerâ€”that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?â€
939987 [11039] smiled Ivan. â€œShall I tell it to you?â€
939987 [11040] 
939987 [11041] â€œI am all attention,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [11042] 
939987 [11043] â€œMy poem is called â€˜The Grand Inquisitorâ€™; itâ€™s a ridiculous thing, but I
939987 [11044] want to tell it to you.â€
939987 [11045] 
939987 [11046] 
939987 [11047] 
939987 [11048] Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor
939987 [11049] 
939987 [11050] 
939987 [11051] â€œEven this must have a prefaceâ€”that is, a literary preface,â€ laughed Ivan,
939987 [11052] â€œand I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the
939987 [11053] sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it
939987 [11054] was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to
939987 [11055] speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the
939987 [11056] monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the
939987 [11057] saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In
939987 [11058] those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugoâ€™s _Notre Dame de
939987 [11059] Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in
939987 [11060] the HÃ´tel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the
939987 [11061] birth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la trÃ¨s sainte et
939987 [11062] gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and
939987 [11063] pronounces her _bon jugement_. Similar plays, chiefly from the Old
939987 [11064] Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of
939987 [11065] Peter the Great. But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and
939987 [11066] ballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all
939987 [11067] the powers of Heaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monks
939987 [11068] busied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such
939987 [11069] poemsâ€”and even under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of
939987 [11070] course, from the Greek), _The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell_, with
939987 [11071] descriptions as bold as Danteâ€™s. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel
939987 [11072] Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners and their
939987 [11073] punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a
939987 [11074] burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they
939987 [11075] canâ€™t swim out, and â€˜these God forgetsâ€™â€”an expression of extraordinary
939987 [11076] depth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the
939987 [11077] throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hellâ€”for all she has seen
939987 [11078] there, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immensely
939987 [11079] interesting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God points
939987 [11080] to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, â€˜How can
939987 [11081] I forgive His tormentors?â€™ she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all
939987 [11082] the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all
939987 [11083] without distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite of
939987 [11084] suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at
939987 [11085] once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, â€˜Thou art just, O
939987 [11086] Lord, in this judgment.â€™ Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it
939987 [11087] had appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He says
939987 [11088] nothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since
939987 [11089] He promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet
939987 [11090] wrote, â€˜Behold, I come quicklyâ€™; â€˜Of that day and that hour knoweth no
939987 [11091] man, neither the Son, but the Father,â€™ as He Himself predicted on earth.
939987 [11092] But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh,
939987 [11093] with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to
939987 [11094] see signs from heaven.
939987 [11095] 
939987 [11096] 
939987 [11097]     No signs from heaven come to-day
939987 [11098]     To add to what the heart doth say.
939987 [11099] 
939987 [11100] 
939987 [11101] There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true
939987 [11102] there were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed
939987 [11103] miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were
939987 [11104] visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, and
939987 [11105] doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And
939987 [11106] just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. â€œA
939987 [11107] huge star like to a torchâ€ (that is, to a church) â€œfell on the sources of
939987 [11108] the waters and they became bitter.â€ These heretics began blasphemously
939987 [11109] denying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent
939987 [11110] in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before, awaited
939987 [11111] His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him as
939987 [11112] before. And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor, â€œO Lord
939987 [11113] our God, hasten Thy coming,â€ so many ages called upon Him, that in His
939987 [11114] infinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He
939987 [11115] had come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as is
939987 [11116] written in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the
939987 [11117] truth of his words, bore witness that
939987 [11118] 
939987 [11119] 
939987 [11120]     Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,
939987 [11121]     Weary and worn, the Heavenly King
939987 [11122]     Our mother, Russia, came to bless,
939987 [11123]     And through our land went wandering.
939987 [11124] 
939987 [11125] 
939987 [11126] And that certainly was so, I assure you.
939987 [11127] 
939987 [11128] â€œAnd behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the
939987 [11129] tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him like
939987 [11130] children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible time
939987 [11131] of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God,
939987 [11132] and â€˜in the splendid _auto da fÃ©_ the wicked heretics were burnt.â€™ Oh, of
939987 [11133] course, this was not the coming in which He will appear according to His
939987 [11134] promise at the end of time in all His heavenly glory, and which will be
939987 [11135] sudden â€˜as lightning flashing from east to west.â€™ No, He visited His
939987 [11136] children only for a moment, and there where the flames were crackling
939987 [11137] round the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in
939987 [11138] that human shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen
939987 [11139] centuries ago. He came down to the â€˜hot pavementsâ€™ of the southern town in
939987 [11140] which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, _ad majorem gloriam
939987 [11141] Dei_, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent
939987 [11142] _auto da fÃ©_, in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, the
939987 [11143] cardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole population
939987 [11144] of Seville.
939987 [11145] 
939987 [11146] â€œHe came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognized
939987 [11147] Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they
939987 [11148] recognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround
939987 [11149] Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst
939987 [11150] with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His
939987 [11151] heart, light and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on
939987 [11152] the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His
939987 [11153] hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with
939987 [11154] Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from
939987 [11155] childhood, cries out, â€˜O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!â€™ and, as it
939987 [11156] were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd
939987 [11157] weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before
939987 [11158] Him, sing, and cry hosannah. â€˜It is Heâ€”it is He!â€™ all repeat. â€˜It must be
939987 [11159] He, it can be no one but Him!â€™ He stops at the steps of the Seville
939987 [11160] cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little
939987 [11161] open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a
939987 [11162] prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. â€˜He will raise
939987 [11163] your child,â€™ the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to
939987 [11164] meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead
939987 [11165] child throws herself at His feet with a wail. â€˜If it is Thou, raise my
939987 [11166] child!â€™ she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the
939987 [11167] coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His
939987 [11168] lips once more softly pronounce, â€˜Maiden, arise!â€™ and the maiden arises.
939987 [11169] The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with
939987 [11170] wide-open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in
939987 [11171] her hand.
939987 [11172] 
939987 [11173] â€œThere are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the
939987 [11174] cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an
939987 [11175] old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken
939987 [11176] eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his
939987 [11177] gorgeous cardinalâ€™s robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning
939987 [11178] the enemies of the Roman Churchâ€”at this moment he is wearing his coarse,
939987 [11179] old, monkâ€™s cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants
939987 [11180] and slaves and the â€˜holy guard.â€™ He stops at the sight of the crowd and
939987 [11181] watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the
939987 [11182] coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He
939987 [11183] knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He
939987 [11184] holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power,
939987 [11185] so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience
939987 [11186] to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the
939987 [11187] midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The
939987 [11188] crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old
939987 [11189] Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards
939987 [11190] lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient
939987 [11191] palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is
939987 [11192] followed by the dark, burning, â€˜breathlessâ€™ night of Seville. The air is
939987 [11193] â€˜fragrant with laurel and lemon.â€™ In the pitch darkness the iron door of
939987 [11194] the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in
939987 [11195] with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind
939987 [11196] him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face.
939987 [11197] At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.
939987 [11198] 
939987 [11199] â€œ â€˜Is it Thou? Thou?â€™ but receiving no answer, he adds at once, â€˜Donâ€™t
939987 [11200] answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou
939987 [11201] wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst
939987 [11202] said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to
939987 [11203] hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be
939987 [11204] to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou
939987 [11205] or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn
939987 [11206] Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have
939987 [11207] to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush
939987 [11208] to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou
939987 [11209] knowest it,â€™ he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment
939987 [11210] taking his eyes off the Prisoner.â€
939987 [11211] 
939987 [11212] â€œI donâ€™t quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?â€ Alyosha, who had been
939987 [11213] listening in silence, said with a smile. â€œIs it simply a wild fantasy, or
939987 [11214] a mistake on the part of the old manâ€”some impossible _quiproquo_?â€
939987 [11215] 
939987 [11216] â€œTake it as the last,â€ said Ivan, laughing, â€œif you are so corrupted by
939987 [11217] modern realism and canâ€™t stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be a
939987 [11218] case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,â€ he went on,
939987 [11219] laughing, â€œthe old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his set
939987 [11220] idea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. It
939987 [11221] might, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man of
939987 [11222] ninety, over-excited by the _auto da fÃ©_ of a hundred heretics the day
939987 [11223] before. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of
939987 [11224] identity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should
939987 [11225] speak out, should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for
939987 [11226] ninety years.â€
939987 [11227] 
939987 [11228] â€œAnd the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a word?â€
939987 [11229] 
939987 [11230] â€œThatâ€™s inevitable in any case,â€ Ivan laughed again. â€œThe old man has told
939987 [11231] Him He hasnâ€™t the right to add anything to what He has said of old. One
939987 [11232] may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my
939987 [11233] opinion at least. â€˜All has been given by Thee to the Pope,â€™ they say, â€˜and
939987 [11234] all, therefore, is still in the Popeâ€™s hands, and there is no need for
939987 [11235] Thee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.â€™
939987 [11236] Thatâ€™s how they speak and write tooâ€”the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read
939987 [11237] it myself in the works of their theologians. â€˜Hast Thou the right to
939987 [11238] reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast
939987 [11239] come?â€™ my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. â€˜No, Thou
939987 [11240] hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, and
939987 [11241] mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast
939987 [11242] on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on menâ€™s freedom of
939987 [11243] faith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of their
939987 [11244] faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years
939987 [11245] ago. Didst Thou not often say then, â€œI will make you freeâ€? But now Thou
939987 [11246] hast seen these â€œfreeâ€ men,â€™ the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive
939987 [11247] smile. â€˜Yes, weâ€™ve paid dearly for it,â€™ he goes on, looking sternly at
939987 [11248] Him, â€˜but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen
939987 [11249] centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and
939987 [11250] over for good. Dost Thou not believe that itâ€™s over for good? Thou lookest
939987 [11251] meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tell
939987 [11252] Thee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have
939987 [11253] perfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it
939987 [11254] humbly at our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst?
939987 [11255] Was this Thy freedom?â€™ â€
939987 [11256] 
939987 [11257] â€œI donâ€™t understand again,â€ Alyosha broke in. â€œIs he ironical, is he
939987 [11258] jesting?â€
939987 [11259] 
939987 [11260] â€œNot a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that
939987 [11261] at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy.
939987 [11262] â€˜For nowâ€™ (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) â€˜for the first
939987 [11263] time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men. Man was
939987 [11264] created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,â€™ he says
939987 [11265] to Him. â€˜Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst
939987 [11266] not listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men
939987 [11267] might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the
939987 [11268] work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thou
939987 [11269] hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thou
939987 [11270] canst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder
939987 [11271] us?â€™ â€
939987 [11272] 
939987 [11273] â€œAnd whatâ€™s the meaning of â€˜no lack of admonitions and warningsâ€™?â€ asked
939987 [11274] Alyosha.
939987 [11275] 
939987 [11276] â€œWhy, thatâ€™s the chief part of what the old man must say.
939987 [11277] 
939987 [11278] â€œ â€˜The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and
939987 [11279] non-existence,â€™ the old man goes on, â€˜the great spirit talked with Thee in
939987 [11280] the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he â€œtemptedâ€ Thee. Is
939987 [11281] that so? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in
939987 [11282] three questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is
939987 [11283] called â€œthe temptationâ€? And yet if there has ever been on earth a real
939987 [11284] stupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three
939987 [11285] temptations. The statement of those three questions was itself the
939987 [11286] miracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument
939987 [11287] that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from
939987 [11288] the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to
939987 [11289] do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earthâ€”rulers, chief
939987 [11290] priests, learned men, philosophers, poetsâ€”and had set them the task to
939987 [11291] invent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but
939987 [11292] express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history of
939987 [11293] the world and of humanityâ€”dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of the
939987 [11294] earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the
939987 [11295] three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and
939987 [11296] mighty spirit in the wilderness? From those questions alone, from the
939987 [11297] miracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not with
939987 [11298] the fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For in
939987 [11299] those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it
939987 [11300] were, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them are
939987 [11301] united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature. At the
939987 [11302] time it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that
939987 [11303] fifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three
939987 [11304] questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly
939987 [11305] fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.
939987 [11306] 
939987 [11307] â€œ â€˜Judge Thyself who was rightâ€”Thou or he who questioned Thee then?
939987 [11308] Remember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this: â€œThou
939987 [11309] wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with some
939987 [11310] promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural
939987 [11311] unruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dreadâ€”for nothing
939987 [11312] has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than
939987 [11313] freedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren
939987 [11314] wilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a
939987 [11315] flock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest
939987 [11316] Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.â€ But Thou wouldst not
939987 [11317] deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that
939987 [11318] freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply that
939987 [11319] man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of that
939987 [11320] earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will
939987 [11321] strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him, crying, â€œWho
939987 [11322] can compare with this beast? He has given us fire from heaven!â€ Dost Thou
939987 [11323] know that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of
939987 [11324] their sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only
939987 [11325] hunger? â€œFeed men, and then ask of them virtue!â€ thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ll write
939987 [11326] on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which they
939987 [11327] will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building;
939987 [11328] the terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the one
939987 [11329] of old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new
939987 [11330] tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for
939987 [11331] they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their
939987 [11332] tower. They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for
939987 [11333] we shall be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to
939987 [11334] us, â€œFeed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven havenâ€™t
939987 [11335] given it!â€ And then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishes
939987 [11336] the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name,
939987 [11337] declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they feed
939987 [11338] themselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as they
939987 [11339] remain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say
939987 [11340] to us, â€œMake us your slaves, but feed us.â€ They will understand
939987 [11341] themselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are
939987 [11342] inconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share
939987 [11343] between them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free,
939987 [11344] for they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. Thou didst promise
939987 [11345] them the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly
939987 [11346] bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if
939987 [11347] for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is
939987 [11348] to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures
939987 [11349] who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of
939987 [11350] the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the
939987 [11351] great and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea,
939987 [11352] who are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and
939987 [11353] strong? No, we care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but
939987 [11354] in the end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and look
939987 [11355] on us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have
939987 [11356] found so dreadful and to rule over themâ€”so awful it will seem to them to
939987 [11357] be free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in
939987 [11358] Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us
939987 [11359] again. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to
939987 [11360] lie.
939987 [11361] 
939987 [11362] â€œ â€˜This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, and
939987 [11363] this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou
939987 [11364] hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the great
939987 [11365] secret of this world. Choosing â€œbread,â€ Thou wouldst have satisfied the
939987 [11366] universal and everlasting craving of humanityâ€”to find some one to worship.
939987 [11367] So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so
939987 [11368] painfully as to find some one to worship. But man seeks to worship what is
939987 [11369] established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship
939987 [11370] it. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or
939987 [11371] the other can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and
939987 [11372] worship; what is essential is that all may be _together_ in it. This
939987 [11373] craving for _community_ of worship is the chief misery of every man
939987 [11374] individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake
939987 [11375] of common worship theyâ€™ve slain each other with the sword. They have set
939987 [11376] up gods and challenged one another, â€œPut away your gods and come and
939987 [11377] worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!â€ And so it will be to the
939987 [11378] end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall
939987 [11379] down before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but
939987 [11380] have known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject
939987 [11381] the one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down
939987 [11382] to Thee aloneâ€”the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for
939987 [11383] the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didst
939987 [11384] further. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man is
939987 [11385] tormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom he
939987 [11386] can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is
939987 [11387] born. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their
939987 [11388] freedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread,
939987 [11389] and man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if
939987 [11390] some one else gains possession of his conscienceâ€”oh! then he will cast
939987 [11391] away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience. In
939987 [11392] that Thou wast right. For the secret of manâ€™s being is not only to live
939987 [11393] but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the
939987 [11394] object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather
939987 [11395] destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.
939987 [11396] That is true. But what happened? Instead of taking menâ€™s freedom from
939987 [11397] them, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man
939987 [11398] prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of
939987 [11399] good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of
939987 [11400] conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,
939987 [11401] instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at
939987 [11402] rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and
939987 [11403] enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men,
939987 [11404] acting as though Thou didst not love them at allâ€”Thou who didst come to
939987 [11405] give Thy life for them! Instead of taking possession of menâ€™s freedom,
939987 [11406] Thou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with
939987 [11407] its sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire manâ€™s free love, that he should
939987 [11408] follow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the
939987 [11409] rigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself
939987 [11410] what is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his
939987 [11411] guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even Thy image
939987 [11412] and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free
939987 [11413] choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, for
939987 [11414] they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou
939987 [11415] hast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.
939987 [11416] 
939987 [11417] â€œ â€˜So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the
939987 [11418] destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet what
939987 [11419] was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone, able to
939987 [11420] conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent
939987 [11421] rebels for their happinessâ€”those forces are miracle, mystery and
939987 [11422] authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing
939987 [11423] so. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple
939987 [11424] and said to Thee, â€œIf Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God
939987 [11425] then cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up
939987 [11426] lest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art
939987 [11427] the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father.â€
939987 [11428] But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down. Oh, of course,
939987 [11429] Thou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men,
939987 [11430] are they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in making
939987 [11431] one movement to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have
939987 [11432] lost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against
939987 [11433] that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise spirit that tempted
939987 [11434] Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And
939987 [11435] couldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such a
939987 [11436] temptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and
939987 [11437] at the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most
939987 [11438] agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the
939987 [11439] heart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, would
939987 [11440] be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thou
939987 [11441] didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a
939987 [11442] miracle. But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects
939987 [11443] God too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And as man
939987 [11444] cannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new miracles of
939987 [11445] his own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft,
939987 [11446] though he might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou
939987 [11447] didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and
939987 [11448] reviling Thee, â€œCome down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art
939987 [11449] He.â€ Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a
939987 [11450] miracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. Thou
939987 [11451] didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before
939987 [11452] the might that has overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly
939987 [11453] of men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by
939987 [11454] nature. Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon
939987 [11455] them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and
939987 [11456] baser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he, can he do what Thou
939987 [11457] didst? By showing him so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to
939987 [11458] feel for him, for Thou didst ask far too much from himâ€”Thou who hast loved
939987 [11459] him more than Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less
939987 [11460] of him. That would have been more like love, for his burden would have
939987 [11461] been lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
939987 [11462] rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the pride
939987 [11463] of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and barring
939987 [11464] out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will end; it will
939987 [11465] cost them dear. They will cast down temples and drench the earth with
939987 [11466] blood. But they will see at last, the foolish children, that, though they
939987 [11467] are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their own
939987 [11468] rebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears, they will recognize at last that
939987 [11469] He who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them. They will say
939987 [11470] this in despair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make
939987 [11471] them more unhappy still, for manâ€™s nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in
939987 [11472] the end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and
939987 [11473] unhappinessâ€”that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so much
939987 [11474] for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in image, that he
939987 [11475] saw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there were
939987 [11476] of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there were so many of them, they
939987 [11477] must have been not men but gods. They had borne Thy cross, they had
939987 [11478] endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living upon
939987 [11479] locusts and rootsâ€”and Thou mayest indeed point with pride at those
939987 [11480] children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy
939987 [11481] name. But remember that they were only some thousands; and what of the
939987 [11482] rest? And how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not
939987 [11483] endure what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that it
939987 [11484] is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply come to
939987 [11485] the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and we cannot
939987 [11486] understand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right to preach a
939987 [11487] mystery, and to teach them that itâ€™s not the free judgment of their
939987 [11488] hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which they must follow
939987 [11489] blindly, even against their conscience. So we have done. We have corrected
939987 [11490] Thy work and have founded it upon _miracle_, _mystery_ and _authority_.
939987 [11491] And men rejoiced that they were again led like sheep, and that the
939987 [11492] terrible gift that had brought them such suffering was, at last, lifted
939987 [11493] from their hearts. Were we right teaching them this? Speak! Did we not
939987 [11494] love mankind, so meekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly
939987 [11495] lightening their burden, and permitting their weak nature even sin with
939987 [11496] our sanction? Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look
939987 [11497] silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I donâ€™t want
939987 [11498] Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anything
939987 [11499] from Thee? Donâ€™t I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is known
939987 [11500] to Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our mystery?
939987 [11501] Perhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not
939987 [11502] working with Thee, but with _him_â€”that is our mystery. Itâ€™s longâ€”eight
939987 [11503] centuriesâ€”since we have been on _his_ side and not on Thine. Just eight
939987 [11504] centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that
939987 [11505] last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We
939987 [11506] took from him Rome and the sword of CÃ¦sar, and proclaimed ourselves sole
939987 [11507] rulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been able to complete our
939987 [11508] work. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has
939987 [11509] begun. It has long to await completion and the earth has yet much to
939987 [11510] suffer, but we shall triumph and shall be CÃ¦sars, and then we shall plan
939987 [11511] the universal happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then the
939987 [11512] sword of CÃ¦sar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst Thou accepted
939987 [11513] that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished all
939987 [11514] that man seeks on earthâ€”that is, some one to worship, some one to keep his
939987 [11515] conscience, and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious
939987 [11516] ant-heap, for the craving for universal unity is the third and last
939987 [11517] anguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a
939987 [11518] universal state. There have been many great nations with great histories,
939987 [11519] but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for
939987 [11520] they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union.
939987 [11521] The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes
939987 [11522] over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they too
939987 [11523] were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal
939987 [11524] unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and CÃ¦sarâ€™s purple, Thou wouldst have
939987 [11525] founded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who can
939987 [11526] rule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his
939987 [11527] hands? We have taken the sword of CÃ¦sar, and in taking it, of course, have
939987 [11528] rejected Thee and followed _him_. Oh, ages are yet to come of the
939987 [11529] confusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having
939987 [11530] begun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,
939987 [11531] with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet
939987 [11532] and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon the beast and
939987 [11533] raise the cup, and on it will be written, â€œMystery.â€ But then, and only
939987 [11534] then, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men. Thou art proud
939987 [11535] of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we give rest to all.
939987 [11536] And besides, how many of those elect, those mighty ones who could become
939987 [11537] elect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will
939987 [11538] transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the
939987 [11539] other camp, and end by raising their _free_ banner against Thee. Thou
939987 [11540] didst Thyself lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will
939987 [11541] no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shall
939987 [11542] persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their
939987 [11543] freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right or shall we be
939987 [11544] lying? They will be convinced that we are right, for they will remember
939987 [11545] the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.
939987 [11546] Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and
939987 [11547] will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries,
939987 [11548] that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves,
939987 [11549] others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest,
939987 [11550] weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: â€œYes,
939987 [11551] you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you,
939987 [11552] save us from ourselves!â€
939987 [11553] 
939987 [11554] â€œ â€˜Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread
939987 [11555] made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any miracle.
939987 [11556] They will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but in truth they
939987 [11557] will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread
939987 [11558] itself! For they will remember only too well that in old days, without our
939987 [11559] help, even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands, while
939987 [11560] since they have come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in
939987 [11561] their hands. Too, too well will they know the value of complete
939987 [11562] submission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to
939987 [11563] blame for their not knowing it?â€”speak! Who scattered the flock and sent it
939987 [11564] astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come together again and will
939987 [11565] submit once more, and then it will be once for all. Then we shall give
939987 [11566] them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by
939987 [11567] nature. Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst
939987 [11568] lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that
939987 [11569] they are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike
939987 [11570] happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look to
939987 [11571] us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvel
939987 [11572] at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our being
939987 [11573] so powerful and clever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent
939987 [11574] flock of thousands of millions. They will tremble impotently before our
939987 [11575] wrath, their minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tears
939987 [11576] like women and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from us
939987 [11577] to pass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes,
939987 [11578] we shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their
939987 [11579] life like a childâ€™s game, with childrenâ€™s songs and innocent dance. Oh, we
939987 [11580] shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love
939987 [11581] us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall tell them that
939987 [11582] every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that we
939987 [11583] allow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these sins
939987 [11584] we take upon ourselves. And we shall take it upon ourselves, and they will
939987 [11585] adore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins before
939987 [11586] God. And they will have no secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them
939987 [11587] to live with their wives and mistresses, to have or not to have
939987 [11588] childrenâ€”according to whether they have been obedient or disobedientâ€”and
939987 [11589] they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of
939987 [11590] their conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an
939987 [11591] answer for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will
939987 [11592] save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present
939987 [11593] in making a free decision for themselves. And all will be happy, all the
939987 [11594] millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For
939987 [11595] only we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will be
939987 [11596] thousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who
939987 [11597] have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.
939987 [11598] Peacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and
939987 [11599] beyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the
939987 [11600] secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of
939987 [11601] heaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world, it
939987 [11602] certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that Thou wilt
939987 [11603] come again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud and
939987 [11604] strong, but we will say that they have only saved themselves, but we have
939987 [11605] saved all. We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds
939987 [11606] in her hands the _mystery_, shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise
939987 [11607] up again, and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her
939987 [11608] loathsome body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the
939987 [11609] thousand millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we who have
939987 [11610] taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and
939987 [11611] say: â€œJudge us if Thou canst and darest.â€ Know that I fear Thee not. Know
939987 [11612] that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on roots and
939987 [11613] locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and I
939987 [11614] too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful,
939987 [11615] thirsting â€œto make up the number.â€ But I awakened and would not serve
939987 [11616] madness. I turned back and joined the ranks of those _who have corrected
939987 [11617] Thy work_. I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness
939987 [11618] of the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will
939987 [11619] be built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at
939987 [11620] a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on
939987 [11621] which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if any one has ever
939987 [11622] deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn Thee. _Dixi._â€™ â€
939987 [11623] 
939987 [11624] Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with excitement;
939987 [11625] when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.
939987 [11626] 
939987 [11627] Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved and
939987 [11628] seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained himself.
939987 [11629] Now his words came with a rush.
939987 [11630] 
939987 [11631] â€œBut ... thatâ€™s absurd!â€ he cried, flushing. â€œYour poem is in praise of
939987 [11632] Jesus, not in blame of Himâ€”as you meant it to be. And who will believe you
939987 [11633] about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? Thatâ€™s not the idea of it
939987 [11634] in the Orthodox Church.... Thatâ€™s Rome, and not even the whole of Rome,
939987 [11635] itâ€™s falseâ€”those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the
939987 [11636] Jesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your
939987 [11637] Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who
939987 [11638] are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves
939987 [11639] for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know the
939987 [11640] Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you
939987 [11641] describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply the
939987 [11642] Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with
939987 [11643] the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... thatâ€™s their ideal, but thereâ€™s no
939987 [11644] sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... Itâ€™s simple lust of
939987 [11645] power, of filthy earthly gain, of dominationâ€”something like a universal
939987 [11646] serfdom with them as mastersâ€”thatâ€™s all they stand for. They donâ€™t even
939987 [11647] believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.â€
939987 [11648] 
939987 [11649] â€œStay, stay,â€ laughed Ivan, â€œhow hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it be
939987 [11650] so! Of course itâ€™s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really think
939987 [11651] that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing
939987 [11652] but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is that Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s
939987 [11653] teaching?â€
939987 [11654] 
939987 [11655] â€œNo, no, on the contrary, Father PaÃ¯ssy did once say something rather the
939987 [11656] same as you ... but of course itâ€™s not the same, not a bit the same,â€
939987 [11657] Alyosha hastily corrected himself.
939987 [11658] 
939987 [11659] â€œA precious admission, in spite of your â€˜not a bit the same.â€™ I ask you
939987 [11660] why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material
939987 [11661] gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow
939987 [11662] and loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was one such man
939987 [11663] among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gainâ€”if thereâ€™s
939987 [11664] only one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert
939987 [11665] and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and
939987 [11666] perfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes
939987 [11667] were opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain
939987 [11668] perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction that
939987 [11669] millions of Godâ€™s creatures have been created as a mockery, that they will
939987 [11670] never be capable of using their freedom, that these poor rebels can never
939987 [11671] turn into giants to complete the tower, that it was not for such geese
939987 [11672] that the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that he
939987 [11673] turned back and joinedâ€”the clever people. Surely that could have
939987 [11674] happened?â€
939987 [11675] 
939987 [11676] â€œJoined whom, what clever people?â€ cried Alyosha, completely carried away.
939987 [11677] â€œThey have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets....
939987 [11678] Perhaps nothing but Atheism, thatâ€™s all their secret. Your Inquisitor does
939987 [11679] not believe in God, thatâ€™s his secret!â€
939987 [11680] 
939987 [11681] â€œWhat if it is so! At last you have guessed it. Itâ€™s perfectly true, itâ€™s
939987 [11682] true that thatâ€™s the whole secret, but isnâ€™t that suffering, at least for
939987 [11683] a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could
939987 [11684] not shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old age he reached
939987 [11685] the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit
939987 [11686] could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly,
939987 [11687] â€˜incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.â€™ And so, convinced of
939987 [11688] this, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the
939987 [11689] dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and
939987 [11690] deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet
939987 [11691] deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being
939987 [11692] led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think
939987 [11693] themselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose
939987 [11694] ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that
939987 [11695] tragic? And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army â€˜filled
939987 [11696] with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gainâ€™â€”would not one
939987 [11697] such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the
939987 [11698] head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with
939987 [11699] all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I
939987 [11700] firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood
939987 [11701] at the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such even
939987 [11702] among the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old
939987 [11703] man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found even
939987 [11704] now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by
939987 [11705] agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the
939987 [11706] mystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them
939987 [11707] happy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even
939987 [11708] among the Masons thereâ€™s something of the same mystery at the bottom, and
939987 [11709] that thatâ€™s why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals
939987 [11710] breaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there
939987 [11711] should be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea
939987 [11712] I might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.â€
939987 [11713] 
939987 [11714] â€œYou are perhaps a Mason yourself!â€ broke suddenly from Alyosha. â€œYou
939987 [11715] donâ€™t believe in God,â€ he added, speaking this time very sorrowfully. He
939987 [11716] fancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically. â€œHow does
939987 [11717] your poem end?â€ he asked, suddenly looking down. â€œOr was it the end?â€
939987 [11718] 
939987 [11719] â€œI meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he
939987 [11720] waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed down
939987 [11721] upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time,
939987 [11722] looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply. The old man
939987 [11723] longed for Him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But He
939987 [11724] suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his
939987 [11725] bloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His
939987 [11726] lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: â€˜Go, and come
939987 [11727] no more ... come not at all, never, never!â€™ And he let Him out into the
939987 [11728] dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.â€
939987 [11729] 
939987 [11730] â€œAnd the old man?â€
939987 [11731] 
939987 [11732] â€œThe kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.â€
939987 [11733] 
939987 [11734] â€œAnd you with him, you too?â€ cried Alyosha, mournfully.
939987 [11735] 
939987 [11736] Ivan laughed.
939987 [11737] 
939987 [11738] â€œWhy, itâ€™s all nonsense, Alyosha. Itâ€™s only a senseless poem of a
939987 [11739] senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do you
939987 [11740] take it so seriously? Surely you donâ€™t suppose I am going straight off to
939987 [11741] the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord, itâ€™s
939987 [11742] no business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, and
939987 [11743] then ... dash the cup to the ground!â€
939987 [11744] 
939987 [11745] â€œBut the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky,
939987 [11746] and the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?â€
939987 [11747] Alyosha cried sorrowfully. â€œWith such a hell in your heart and your head,
939987 [11748] how can you? No, thatâ€™s just what you are going away for, to join them ...
939987 [11749] if not, you will kill yourself, you canâ€™t endure it!â€
939987 [11750] 
939987 [11751] â€œThere is a strength to endure everything,â€ Ivan said with a cold smile.
939987 [11752] 
939987 [11753] â€œWhat strength?â€
939987 [11754] 
939987 [11755] â€œThe strength of the Karamazovsâ€”the strength of the Karamazov baseness.â€
939987 [11756] 
939987 [11757] â€œTo sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?â€
939987 [11758] 
939987 [11759] â€œPossibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it,
939987 [11760] and thenâ€”â€
939987 [11761] 
939987 [11762] â€œHow will you escape it? By what will you escape it? Thatâ€™s impossible
939987 [11763] with your ideas.â€
939987 [11764] 
939987 [11765] â€œIn the Karamazov way, again.â€
939987 [11766] 
939987 [11767] â€œ â€˜Everything is lawful,â€™ you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?â€
939987 [11768] 
939987 [11769] Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.
939987 [11770] 
939987 [11771] â€œAh, youâ€™ve caught up yesterdayâ€™s phrase, which so offended MiÃ¼sovâ€”and
939987 [11772] which Dmitri pounced upon so naÃ¯vely, and paraphrased!â€ he smiled queerly.
939987 [11773] â€œYes, if you like, â€˜everything is lawfulâ€™ since the word has been said. I
939987 [11774] wonâ€™t deny it. And Mityaâ€™s version isnâ€™t bad.â€
939987 [11775] 
939987 [11776] Alyosha looked at him in silence.
939987 [11777] 
939987 [11778] â€œI thought that going away from here I have you at least,â€ Ivan said
939987 [11779] suddenly, with unexpected feeling; â€œbut now I see that there is no place
939987 [11780] for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, â€˜all is lawful,â€™ I
939987 [11781] wonâ€™t renounceâ€”will you renounce me for that, yes?â€
939987 [11782] 
939987 [11783] Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.
939987 [11784] 
939987 [11785] â€œThatâ€™s plagiarism,â€ cried Ivan, highly delighted. â€œYou stole that from my
939987 [11786] poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, itâ€™s time we were going, both of
939987 [11787] us.â€
939987 [11788] 
939987 [11789] They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the
939987 [11790] restaurant.
939987 [11791] 
939987 [11792] â€œListen, Alyosha,â€ Ivan began in a resolute voice, â€œif I am really able to
939987 [11793] care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you.
939987 [11794] Itâ€™s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shanâ€™t lose my
939987 [11795] desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of
939987 [11796] love if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left. And itâ€™s
939987 [11797] enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I donâ€™t go away to-morrow (I
939987 [11798] think I certainly shall go) and we meet again, donâ€™t say a word more on
939987 [11799] these subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you
939987 [11800] specially, never speak to me again,â€ he added, with sudden irritation;
939987 [11801] â€œitâ€™s all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasnâ€™t it?
939987 [11802] And Iâ€™ll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want to
939987 [11803] â€˜dash the cup to the ground,â€™ wherever I may be Iâ€™ll come to have one more
939987 [11804] talk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that.
939987 [11805] Iâ€™ll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you,
939987 [11806] to see what youâ€™ll be by that time. Itâ€™s rather a solemn promise, you see.
939987 [11807] And we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your
939987 [11808] Pater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry
939987 [11809] with me for having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; thatâ€™s right, now
939987 [11810] go.â€
939987 [11811] 
939987 [11812] Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just as
939987 [11813] Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very
939987 [11814] different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [11815] mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little,
939987 [11816] looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he
939987 [11817] walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had
939987 [11818] never noticed it before. But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to
939987 [11819] the monastery. It was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened;
939987 [11820] something new was growing up in him for which he could not account. The
939987 [11821] wind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines
939987 [11822] murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse. He almost
939987 [11823] ran. â€œPater Seraphicusâ€”he got that name from somewhereâ€”where from?â€
939987 [11824] Alyosha wondered. â€œIvan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?...
939987 [11825] Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will
939987 [11826] save meâ€”from him and for ever!â€
939987 [11827] 
939987 [11828] Several times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving Ivan so
939987 [11829] completely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only a
939987 [11830] few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing
939987 [11831] so, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.
939987 [11832] 
939987 [11833] 
939987 [11834] 
939987 [11835] Chapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure One
939987 [11836] 
939987 [11837] 
939987 [11838] And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s house.
939987 [11839] But, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, which
939987 [11840] grew greater at every step he took towards the house. There was nothing
939987 [11841] strange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not
939987 [11842] have said what was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before,
939987 [11843] and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when
939987 [11844] he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was
939987 [11845] preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown
939987 [11846] future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had great
939987 [11847] hopes, and greatâ€”too greatâ€”expectations from life, he could not have given
939987 [11848] any definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires.
939987 [11849] 
939987 [11850] Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown
939987 [11851] certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something
939987 [11852] quite different. â€œIs it loathing for my fatherâ€™s house?â€ he wondered.
939987 [11853] â€œQuite likely; I am so sick of it; and though itâ€™s the last time I shall
939987 [11854] cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, itâ€™s not that
939987 [11855] either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with
939987 [11856] him? For so many years Iâ€™ve been silent with the whole world and not
939987 [11857] deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.â€
939987 [11858] It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful
939987 [11859] inexperience and vanityâ€”vexation at having failed to express himself,
939987 [11860] especially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly
939987 [11861] been reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done
939987 [11862] indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. â€œI feel sick with
939987 [11863] depression and yet I canâ€™t tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.â€
939987 [11864] 
939987 [11865] Ivan tried â€œnot to think,â€ but that, too, was no use. What made his
939987 [11866] depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual,
939987 [11867] external characterâ€”he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to be
939987 [11868] standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself
939987 [11869] upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that
939987 [11870] for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost
939987 [11871] torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object,
939987 [11872] often quite a trifling and ridiculous oneâ€”some article left about in the
939987 [11873] wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the
939987 [11874] shelf, and so on.
939987 [11875] 
939987 [11876] At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, and
939987 [11877] suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was
939987 [11878] fretting and worrying him.
939987 [11879] 
939987 [11880] On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the
939987 [11881] coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the
939987 [11882] valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soul
939987 [11883] loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just before,
939987 [11884] when Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had
939987 [11885] felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred
939987 [11886] responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had
939987 [11887] been forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as
939987 [11888] soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten
939987 [11889] sensation began to obtrude itself again. â€œIs it possible that a miserable,
939987 [11890] contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?â€ he wondered, with
939987 [11891] insufferable irritation.
939987 [11892] 
939987 [11893] It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the
939987 [11894] man, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to notice in
939987 [11895] himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature.
939987 [11896] Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came
939987 [11897] to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then he had taken a
939987 [11898] marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He
939987 [11899] had encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a
939987 [11900] certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not
939987 [11901] understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the
939987 [11902] brain of â€œthe contemplative.â€ They discussed philosophical questions and
939987 [11903] even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon,
939987 [11904] and stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be
939987 [11905] understood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might
939987 [11906] be an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov,
939987 [11907] and that he was looking for something altogether different. In one way and
939987 [11908] another, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too,
939987 [11909] and that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on,
939987 [11910] there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and
939987 [11911] there had been the scandals with his brother Dmitriâ€”they discussed that,
939987 [11912] too. But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it
939987 [11913] was impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in
939987 [11914] fact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of
939987 [11915] his desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.
939987 [11916] Smerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously
939987 [11917] premeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, and
939987 [11918] usually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse into
939987 [11919] silence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most
939987 [11920] and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity
939987 [11921] which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not that he forgot
939987 [11922] himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully,
939987 [11923] yet he had obviously begun to considerâ€”goodness knows why!â€”that there was
939987 [11924] some sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always
939987 [11925] spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact,
939987 [11926] some secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on both
939987 [11927] sides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around
939987 [11928] them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of his
939987 [11929] growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root of
939987 [11930] it.
939987 [11931] 
939987 [11932] With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gate
939987 [11933] without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose from the
939987 [11934] bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he wanted
939987 [11935] particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and the fact
939987 [11936] that he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the minute before,
939987 [11937] drove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakovâ€™s
939987 [11938] emasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his
939987 [11939] forehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, â€œWhere are you
939987 [11940] going? You wonâ€™t pass by; you see that we two clever people have something
939987 [11941] to say to each other.â€
939987 [11942] 
939987 [11943] Ivan shook. â€œGet away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?â€ was
939987 [11944] on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heard
939987 [11945] himself say, â€œIs my father still asleep, or has he waked?â€
939987 [11946] 
939987 [11947] He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at once,
939987 [11948] again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant he felt
939987 [11949] almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov stood facing
939987 [11950] him, his hands behind his back, looking at him with assurance and almost
939987 [11951] severity.
939987 [11952] 
939987 [11953] â€œHis honor is still asleep,â€ he articulated deliberately (â€œYou were the
939987 [11954] first to speak, not I,â€ he seemed to say). â€œI am surprised at you, sir,â€
939987 [11955] he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his right
939987 [11956] foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.
939987 [11957] 
939987 [11958] â€œWhy are you surprised at me?â€ Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing his
939987 [11959] utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that he
939987 [11960] was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have gone
939987 [11961] away without satisfying it.
939987 [11962] 
939987 [11963] â€œWhy donâ€™t you go to Tchermashnya, sir?â€ Smerdyakov suddenly raised his
939987 [11964] eyes and smiled familiarly. â€œWhy I smile you must understand of yourself,
939987 [11965] if you are a clever man,â€ his screwed-up left eye seemed to say.
939987 [11966] 
939987 [11967] â€œWhy should I go to Tchermashnya?â€ Ivan asked in surprise.
939987 [11968] 
939987 [11969] Smerdyakov was silent again.
939987 [11970] 
939987 [11971] â€œFyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,â€ he said at last, slowly
939987 [11972] and apparently attaching no significance to his answer. â€œI put you off
939987 [11973] with a secondary reason,â€ he seemed to suggest, â€œsimply to say something.â€
939987 [11974] 
939987 [11975] â€œDamn you! Speak out what you want!â€ Ivan cried angrily at last, passing
939987 [11976] from meekness to violence.
939987 [11977] 
939987 [11978] Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but
939987 [11979] still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.
939987 [11980] 
939987 [11981] â€œSubstantially nothingâ€”but just by way of conversation.â€
939987 [11982] 
939987 [11983] Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan
939987 [11984] knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before
939987 [11985] him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or
939987 [11986] not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov
939987 [11987] seemed to seize the moment.
939987 [11988] 
939987 [11989] â€œIâ€™m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I donâ€™t know how to help
939987 [11990] myself,â€ he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he
939987 [11991] sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
939987 [11992] 
939987 [11993] â€œThey are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,â€
939987 [11994] Smerdyakov went on. â€œI am speaking of your parent and your brother Dmitri
939987 [11995] Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin
939987 [11996] worrying me every minute, â€˜Has she come? Why hasnâ€™t she come?â€™ and so on
939987 [11997] up till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna
939987 [11998] doesnâ€™t come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he
939987 [11999] will be at me again to-morrow morning, â€˜Why hasnâ€™t she come? When will she
939987 [12000] come?â€™â€”as though I were to blame for it. On the other side itâ€™s no better.
939987 [12001] As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his
939987 [12002] gun in his hands: â€˜Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker. If you miss her
939987 [12003] and donâ€™t let me know sheâ€™s beenâ€”Iâ€™ll kill you before any one.â€™ When the
939987 [12004] nightâ€™s over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins
939987 [12005] worrying me to death. â€˜Why hasnâ€™t she come? Will she come soon?â€™ And he,
939987 [12006] too, thinks me to blame because his lady hasnâ€™t come. And every day and
939987 [12007] every hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall
939987 [12008] kill myself in a fright. I canâ€™t depend upon them, sir.â€
939987 [12009] 
939987 [12010] â€œAnd why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri
939987 [12011] Fyodorovitch?â€ said Ivan irritably.
939987 [12012] 
939987 [12013] â€œHow could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I havenâ€™t meddled at all, if
939987 [12014] you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very
939987 [12015] beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his servant.
939987 [12016] He has had only one thing to say since: â€˜Iâ€™ll kill you, you scoundrel, if
939987 [12017] you miss her,â€™ I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fit
939987 [12018] to-morrow.â€
939987 [12019] 
939987 [12020] â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜a long fitâ€™?â€
939987 [12021] 
939987 [12022] â€œA long fit, lasting a long timeâ€”several hours, or perhaps a day or two.
939987 [12023] Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. The
939987 [12024] struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldnâ€™t come
939987 [12025] back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor
939987 [12026] here, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might
939987 [12027] have died.â€
939987 [12028] 
939987 [12029] â€œBut they say one canâ€™t tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What
939987 [12030] makes you say you will have one to-morrow?â€ Ivan inquired, with a
939987 [12031] peculiar, irritable curiosity.
939987 [12032] 
939987 [12033] â€œThatâ€™s just so. You canâ€™t tell beforehand.â€
939987 [12034] 
939987 [12035] â€œBesides, you fell from the garret then.â€
939987 [12036] 
939987 [12037] â€œI climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again
939987 [12038] to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to go
939987 [12039] into the cellar every day, too.â€
939987 [12040] 
939987 [12041] Ivan took a long look at him.
939987 [12042] 
939987 [12043] â€œYou are talking nonsense, I see, and I donâ€™t quite understand you,â€ he
939987 [12044] said softly, but with a sort of menace. â€œDo you mean to pretend to be ill
939987 [12045] to-morrow for three days, eh?â€
939987 [12046] 
939987 [12047] Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toe
939987 [12048] of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and,
939987 [12049] grinning, articulated:
939987 [12050] 
939987 [12051] â€œIf I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fitâ€”and
939987 [12052] it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to themâ€”I should have a
939987 [12053] perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For even if
939987 [12054] Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill, his honor
939987 [12055] canâ€™t blame a sick man for not telling him. Heâ€™d be ashamed to.â€
939987 [12056] 
939987 [12057] â€œHang it all!â€ Ivan cried, his face working with anger, â€œwhy are you
939987 [12058] always in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitriâ€™s threats are
939987 [12059] only hasty words and mean nothing. He wonâ€™t kill you; itâ€™s not you heâ€™ll
939987 [12060] kill!â€
939987 [12061] 
939987 [12062] â€œHeâ€™d kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am
939987 [12063] afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something
939987 [12064] crazy to his father.â€
939987 [12065] 
939987 [12066] â€œWhy should you be taken for an accomplice?â€
939987 [12067] 
939987 [12068] â€œTheyâ€™ll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals as a
939987 [12069] great secret.â€
939987 [12070] 
939987 [12071] â€œWhat signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.â€
939987 [12072] 
939987 [12073] â€œIâ€™m bound to admit the fact,â€ Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure,
939987 [12074] â€œthat I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business. As you know
939987 [12075] yourself (if only you do know it) he has for several days past locked
939987 [12076] himself in as soon as night or even evening comes on. Of late youâ€™ve been
939987 [12077] going upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did not
939987 [12078] come down at all, and so perhaps you donâ€™t know how carefully he has begun
939987 [12079] to lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to
939987 [12080] the door he wonâ€™t open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory
939987 [12081] Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his room
939987 [12082] now. Thatâ€™s the arrangement he made himself ever since this to-do with
939987 [12083] Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his orders, I go away to the
939987 [12084] lodge so that I donâ€™t get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch,
939987 [12085] getting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna
939987 [12086] to come. For the last few days heâ€™s been perfectly frantic expecting her.
939987 [12087] What he argues is, she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he
939987 [12088] calls him), â€˜and so,â€™ says he, â€˜sheâ€™ll come the back-way, late at night,
939987 [12089] to me. You look out for her,â€™ says he, â€˜till midnight and later; and if
939987 [12090] she does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the
939987 [12091] garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more
939987 [12092] quickly, then,â€™ says he, â€˜I shall understand at once that she has come,
939987 [12093] and will open the door to you quietly.â€™ Another signal he gave me in case
939987 [12094] anything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an
939987 [12095] interval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something has
939987 [12096] happened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so that
939987 [12097] I can go and speak to him. Thatâ€™s all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna canâ€™t
939987 [12098] come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might
939987 [12099] come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully afraid
939987 [12100] of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and
939987 [12101] were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere
939987 [12102] near at the time, I should be bound to let him know at once, knocking
939987 [12103] three times. So that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena
939987 [12104] Alexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks means
939987 [12105] â€˜something important to tell you.â€™ His honor has shown me them several
939987 [12106] times and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of
939987 [12107] these signals but myself and his honor, so heâ€™d open the door without the
939987 [12108] slightest hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of
939987 [12109] calling out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [12110] too, now.â€
939987 [12111] 
939987 [12112] â€œHow are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?â€
939987 [12113] 
939987 [12114] â€œIt was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back from
939987 [12115] him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, â€˜You are deceiving me,
939987 [12116] you are hiding something from me! Iâ€™ll break both your legs for you.â€™ So I
939987 [12117] told him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion, and
939987 [12118] might be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was telling him all I
939987 [12119] could.â€
939987 [12120] 
939987 [12121] â€œIf you think that heâ€™ll make use of those signals and try to get in,
939987 [12122] donâ€™t let him in.â€
939987 [12123] 
939987 [12124] â€œBut if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming in
939987 [12125] then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?â€
939987 [12126] 
939987 [12127] â€œHang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confound
939987 [12128] you? Are you laughing at me?â€
939987 [12129] 
939987 [12130] â€œHow could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this fear
939987 [12131] on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment. Fright
939987 [12132] alone will bring it on.â€
939987 [12133] 
939987 [12134] â€œConfound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. Let
939987 [12135] Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.â€
939987 [12136] 
939987 [12137] â€œI should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signals
939987 [12138] without orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearing
939987 [12139] him and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and Marfa
939987 [12140] Ignatyevna intends to give him medicine to-morrow. Theyâ€™ve just arranged
939987 [12141] it. Itâ€™s a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a
939987 [12142] preparation and always keeps it. Itâ€™s a strong thing made from some herb.
939987 [12143] She has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch
939987 [12144] three times a year when his lumbagoâ€™s so bad he is almost paralyzed by it.
939987 [12145] Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his whole back
939987 [12146] for half an hour till itâ€™s quite red and swollen, and whatâ€™s left in the
939987 [12147] bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but not quite all,
939987 [12148] for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and drinks it herself.
939987 [12149] And as they never take strong drink, I assure you they both drop asleep at
939987 [12150] once and sleep sound a very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch
939987 [12151] wakes up he is perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a
939987 [12152] headache from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention
939987 [12153] to-morrow, they wonâ€™t hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
939987 [12154] Theyâ€™ll be asleep.â€
939987 [12155] 
939987 [12156] â€œWhat a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it were
939987 [12157] planned. Youâ€™ll have a fit and theyâ€™ll both be unconscious,â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [12158] â€œBut arenâ€™t you trying to arrange it so?â€ broke from him suddenly, and he
939987 [12159] frowned threateningly.
939987 [12160] 
939987 [12161] â€œHow could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri
939987 [12162] Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, heâ€™ll do it;
939987 [12163] but if not, I shanâ€™t be thrusting him upon his father.â€
939987 [12164] 
939987 [12165] â€œAnd why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you say
939987 [12166] yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna wonâ€™t come at all?â€ Ivan went on, turning
939987 [12167] white with anger. â€œYou say that yourself, and all the while Iâ€™ve been
939987 [12168] here, Iâ€™ve felt sure it was all the old manâ€™s fancy, and the creature
939987 [12169] wonâ€™t come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she doesnâ€™t come?
939987 [12170] Speak, I want to know what you are thinking!â€
939987 [12171] 
939987 [12172] â€œYou know yourself why heâ€™ll come. Whatâ€™s the use of what I think? His
939987 [12173] honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account of
939987 [12174] my illness perhaps, and heâ€™ll dash in, as he did yesterday through
939987 [12175] impatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasnâ€™t escaped him on
939987 [12176] the sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big
939987 [12177] envelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed
939987 [12178] with three seals. On it is written in his own hand, â€˜To my angel
939987 [12179] Grushenka, if she will come,â€™ to which he added three days later, â€˜for my
939987 [12180] little chicken.â€™ Thereâ€™s no knowing what that might do.â€
939987 [12181] 
939987 [12182] â€œNonsense!â€ cried Ivan, almost beside himself. â€œDmitri wonâ€™t come to steal
939987 [12183] money and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him yesterday on
939987 [12184] account of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is, but he wonâ€™t
939987 [12185] steal.â€
939987 [12186] 
939987 [12187] â€œHe is in very great need of money nowâ€”the greatest need, Ivan
939987 [12188] Fyodorovitch. You donâ€™t know in what need he is,â€ Smerdyakov explained,
939987 [12189] with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. â€œHe looks on that
939987 [12190] three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. â€˜My father still
939987 [12191] owes me just three thousand,â€™ he said. And besides that, consider, Ivan
939987 [12192] Fyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. Itâ€™s as good as
939987 [12193] certain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only she
939987 [12194] cares to, to marry herâ€”the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€”if
939987 [12195] only she cares to, and of course she may care to. All Iâ€™ve said is that
939987 [12196] she wonâ€™t come, but maybe sheâ€™s looking for more than thatâ€”I mean to be
939987 [12197] mistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing
939987 [12198] with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a
939987 [12199] stupid thing to do. And sheâ€™s got plenty of sense. She wouldnâ€™t marry a
939987 [12200] beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan
939987 [12201] Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself
939987 [12202] and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the
939987 [12203] masterâ€™s death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him
939987 [12204] simply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your
939987 [12205] father were to die now, thereâ€™d be some forty thousand for sure, even for
939987 [12206] Dmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for heâ€™s made no will.... Dmitri
939987 [12207] Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.â€
939987 [12208] 
939987 [12209] A sort of shudder passed over Ivanâ€™s face. He suddenly flushed.
939987 [12210] 
939987 [12211] â€œThen why on earth,â€ he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, â€œdo you advise me
939987 [12212] to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see
939987 [12213] what will happen here.â€ Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.
939987 [12214] 
939987 [12215] â€œPrecisely so,â€ said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan
939987 [12216] intently, however.
939987 [12217] 
939987 [12218] â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜precisely soâ€™?â€ Ivan questioned him, with a menacing
939987 [12219] light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.
939987 [12220] 
939987 [12221] â€œI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should
939987 [12222] simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,â€
939987 [12223] answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivanâ€™s flashing
939987 [12224] eyes. They were both silent.
939987 [12225] 
939987 [12226] â€œYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and whatâ€™s more ... an awful scoundrel,
939987 [12227] too.â€ Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight
939987 [12228] through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something
939987 [12229] strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his
939987 [12230] fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The
939987 [12231] latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back.
939987 [12232] But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in
939987 [12233] silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
939987 [12234] 
939987 [12235] â€œI am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to knowâ€”early to-morrow
939987 [12236] morning. Thatâ€™s all!â€ he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself
939987 [12237] afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.
939987 [12238] 
939987 [12239] â€œThatâ€™s the best thing you can do,â€ he responded, as though he had
939987 [12240] expected to hear it; â€œexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from
939987 [12241] Moscow, if anything should happen here.â€
939987 [12242] 
939987 [12243] Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change
939987 [12244] had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness had
939987 [12245] completely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation,
939987 [12246] intent but timid and cringing.
939987 [12247] 
939987 [12248] â€œHavenâ€™t you something more to sayâ€”something to add?â€ could be read in the
939987 [12249] intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.
939987 [12250] 
939987 [12251] â€œAnd couldnâ€™t I be sent for from Tchermashnya, tooâ€”in case anything
939987 [12252] happened?â€ Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his
939987 [12253] voice.
939987 [12254] 
939987 [12255] â€œFrom Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,â€ Smerdyakov muttered,
939987 [12256] almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivanâ€™s
939987 [12257] eyes.
939987 [12258] 
939987 [12259] â€œOnly Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save my
939987 [12260] spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, that
939987 [12261] you insist on Tchermashnya?â€
939987 [12262] 
939987 [12263] â€œPrecisely so ...â€ muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He looked
939987 [12264] at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back. But to
939987 [12265] his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate still
939987 [12266] laughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment would have known
939987 [12267] that he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he could not have
939987 [12268] explained himself what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked
939987 [12269] as though in a nervous frenzy.
939987 [12270] 
939987 [12271] 
939987 [12272] 
939987 [12273] Chapter VII. â€œItâ€™s Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Manâ€
939987 [12274] 
939987 [12275] 
939987 [12276] And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [12277] in the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to him, waving his
939987 [12278] hands, â€œI am going upstairs to my room, not in to you. Good-by!â€ and
939987 [12279] passed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the old
939987 [12280] man was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremonious
939987 [12281] display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old
939987 [12282] man evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet
939987 [12283] him in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he
939987 [12284] stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going
939987 [12285] upstairs, till he passed out of sight.
939987 [12286] 
939987 [12287] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with him?â€ he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had
939987 [12288] followed Ivan.
939987 [12289] 
939987 [12290] â€œAngry about something. Who can tell?â€ the valet muttered evasively.
939987 [12291] 
939987 [12292] â€œConfound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get along
939987 [12293] with you. Look sharp! No news?â€
939987 [12294] 
939987 [12295] Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complained
939987 [12296] of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these questions we
939987 [12297] will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old man
939987 [12298] was wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing
939987 [12299] every minute the five knocks agreed upon. Now and then he peered out into
939987 [12300] the darkness, seeing nothing.
939987 [12301] 
939987 [12302] It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up late
939987 [12303] that night, till two oâ€™clock. But we will not give an account of his
939987 [12304] thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soulâ€”its turn will
939987 [12305] come. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account of
939987 [12306] them, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something very vague,
939987 [12307] and, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his
939987 [12308] bearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost
939987 [12309] surprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an
939987 [12310] intense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the
939987 [12311] lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not have
939987 [12312] given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one
939987 [12313] who had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world. On the other
939987 [12314] hand, he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable
939987 [12315] humiliating terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical
939987 [12316] powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling
939987 [12317] in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He even
939987 [12318] hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had with him. At
939987 [12319] moments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot
939987 [12320] to think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he
939987 [12321] remembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to Katerina
939987 [12322] Ivanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered
939987 [12323] in his heart, â€œThatâ€™s nonsense, you are not going, and it wonâ€™t be so easy
939987 [12324] to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.â€
939987 [12325] 
939987 [12326] Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar
939987 [12327] repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, as
939987 [12328] though he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on the
939987 [12329] staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below, had
939987 [12330] listened a long whileâ€”some five minutesâ€”with a sort of strange curiosity,
939987 [12331] holding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this,
939987 [12332] why he was listening, he could not have said. That â€œactionâ€ all his life
939987 [12333] afterwards he called â€œinfamous,â€ and at the bottom of his heart, he
939987 [12334] thought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [12335] himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious
939987 [12336] to know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now.
939987 [12337] He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows
939987 [12338] and stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listeningâ€”for some one
939987 [12339] to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this.
939987 [12340] 
939987 [12341] About two oâ€™clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [12342] had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep at
939987 [12343] once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at once, and
939987 [12344] slept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven oâ€™clock, when it
939987 [12345] was broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himself
939987 [12346] extraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then
939987 [12347] dragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His linen had come
939987 [12348] back from the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at
939987 [12349] the thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his
939987 [12350] departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before (to
939987 [12351] Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day,
939987 [12352] yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed,
939987 [12353] or, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would be
939987 [12354] to pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine
939987 [12355] oâ€™clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, â€œWhere will
939987 [12356] your honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?â€ He looked
939987 [12357] almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,
939987 [12358] something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even
939987 [12359] inquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear his
939987 [12360] answer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour to
939987 [12361] return to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses. His
939987 [12362] father heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an
939987 [12363] unmannerly way to show regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew
939987 [12364] into a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his
939987 [12365] own.
939987 [12366] 
939987 [12367] â€œWhat a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; weâ€™ll manage
939987 [12368] it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to Tchermashnya on
939987 [12369] the way. Itâ€™s only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, only
939987 [12370] another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.â€
939987 [12371] 
939987 [12372] â€œIâ€™m sorry, I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s eighty versts to the railway and the train
939987 [12373] starts for Moscow at seven oâ€™clock to-night. I can only just catch it.â€
939987 [12374] 
939987 [12375] â€œYouâ€™ll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off to
939987 [12376] Tchermashnya. It wonâ€™t put you out much to humor your father! If I hadnâ€™t
939987 [12377] had something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, for
939987 [12378] Iâ€™ve some business there in a hurry. But here I ... itâ€™s not the time for
939987 [12379] me to go now.... You see, Iâ€™ve two pieces of copse land there. The
939987 [12380] Maslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight thousand for the
939987 [12381] timber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given
939987 [12382] twelve. Thereâ€™s no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have
939987 [12383] it all their own way. One has to take what theyâ€™ll give, for no one here
939987 [12384] dare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday
939987 [12385] that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makes
939987 [12386] him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not afraid of
939987 [12387] the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse. Do you
939987 [12388] hear? But heâ€™ll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, so
939987 [12389] you must go at once and make a bargain with him.â€
939987 [12390] 
939987 [12391] â€œWell, you write to the priest; heâ€™ll make the bargain.â€
939987 [12392] 
939987 [12393] â€œHe canâ€™t do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure, Iâ€™d
939987 [12394] give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but he
939987 [12395] has no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him.
939987 [12396] And yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looks
939987 [12397] like a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. Thatâ€™s
939987 [12398] the common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you
939987 [12399] wonder why he is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife
939987 [12400] was dead and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there
939987 [12401] was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is
939987 [12402] alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you have
939987 [12403] to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when he says he
939987 [12404] wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.â€
939987 [12405] 
939987 [12406] â€œI shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.â€
939987 [12407] 
939987 [12408] â€œStay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by
939987 [12409] which you can judge about Gorstkin. Iâ€™ve done business with him a long
939987 [12410] time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red beard.
939987 [12411] If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, itâ€™s all right, he is
939987 [12412] saying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he strokes his beard
939987 [12413] with his left hand and grinsâ€”he is trying to cheat you. Donâ€™t watch his
939987 [12414] eyes, you wonâ€™t find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a
939987 [12415] rogueâ€”but watch his beard! Iâ€™ll give you a note and you show it to him.
939987 [12416] Heâ€™s called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy(4); but donâ€™t call
939987 [12417] him so, he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and
939987 [12418] see itâ€™s all right, write here at once. You need only write: â€˜Heâ€™s not
939987 [12419] lying.â€™ Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, but
939987 [12420] not more. Just think! thereâ€™s a difference between eight thousand and
939987 [12421] eleven thousand. Itâ€™s as good as picking up three thousand; itâ€™s not so
939987 [12422] easy to find a purchaser, and Iâ€™m in desperate need of money. Only let me
939987 [12423] know itâ€™s serious, and Iâ€™ll run over and fix it up. Iâ€™ll snatch the time
939987 [12424] somehow. But whatâ€™s the good of my galloping over, if itâ€™s all a notion of
939987 [12425] the priestâ€™s? Come, will you go?â€
939987 [12426] 
939987 [12427] â€œOh, I canâ€™t spare the time. You must excuse me.â€
939987 [12428] 
939987 [12429] â€œCome, you might oblige your father. I shanâ€™t forget it. Youâ€™ve no heart,
939987 [12430] any of youâ€”thatâ€™s what it is? Whatâ€™s a day or two to you? Where are you
939987 [12431] going nowâ€”to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I would have
939987 [12432] sent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you
939987 [12433] just because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I donâ€™t see that? You
939987 [12434] know nothing about timber, but youâ€™ve got an eye. All that is wanted is to
939987 [12435] see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beardâ€”if his
939987 [12436] beard shakes you know he is in earnest.â€
939987 [12437] 
939987 [12438] â€œYou force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?â€ cried
939987 [12439] Ivan, with a malignant smile.
939987 [12440] 
939987 [12441] Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy, but
939987 [12442] he caught the smile.
939987 [12443] 
939987 [12444] â€œThen youâ€™ll go, youâ€™ll go? Iâ€™ll scribble the note for you at once.â€
939987 [12445] 
939987 [12446] â€œI donâ€™t know whether I shall go. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ll decide on the way.â€
939987 [12447] 
939987 [12448] â€œNonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle the
939987 [12449] matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and heâ€™ll send it on to me
939987 [12450] at once. And I wonâ€™t delay you more than that. You can go to Venice. The
939987 [12451] priest will give you horses back to Volovya station.â€
939987 [12452] 
939987 [12453] The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for the
939987 [12454] horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [12455] was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to-day he seemed to restrain
939987 [12456] himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite
939987 [12457] unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to
939987 [12458] say. Ivan noticed this particularly. â€œHe must be bored with me,â€ he
939987 [12459] thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man
939987 [12460] began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold
939987 [12461] out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and
939987 [12462] instantly pulled himself up.
939987 [12463] 
939987 [12464] â€œWell, good luck to you, good luck to you!â€ he repeated from the steps.
939987 [12465] â€œYouâ€™ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be
939987 [12466] glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!â€
939987 [12467] 
939987 [12468] Ivan got into the carriage.
939987 [12469] 
939987 [12470] â€œGood-by, Ivan! Donâ€™t be too hard on me!â€ the father called for the last
939987 [12471] time.
939987 [12472] 
939987 [12473] The whole household came out to take leaveâ€”Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory.
939987 [12474] Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the
939987 [12475] carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
939987 [12476] 
939987 [12477] â€œYou see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,â€ broke suddenly from Ivan. Again,
939987 [12478] as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed,
939987 [12479] too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after.
939987 [12480] 
939987 [12481] â€œItâ€™s a true saying then, that â€˜itâ€™s always worth while speaking to a
939987 [12482] clever man,â€™ â€ answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.
939987 [12483] 
939987 [12484] The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivanâ€™s soul, but he looked
939987 [12485] eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flock
939987 [12486] of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a sudden he
939987 [12487] felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt intensely
939987 [12488] interested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute later he
939987 [12489] realized that he was not catching anything, and that he had not really
939987 [12490] even taken in the peasantâ€™s answer. He was silent, and it was pleasant
939987 [12491] even so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images of
939987 [12492] Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled,
939987 [12493] blew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. â€œThereâ€™s plenty
939987 [12494] of time for them,â€ he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed
939987 [12495] horses, and galloped to Volovya. â€œWhy is it worth while speaking to a
939987 [12496] clever man? What did he mean by that?â€ The thought seemed suddenly to
939987 [12497] clutch at his breathing. â€œAnd why did I tell him I was going to
939987 [12498] Tchermashnya?â€ They reached Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage,
939987 [12499] and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve
939987 [12500] versts to Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went into
939987 [12501] the station house, looked round, glanced at the overseerâ€™s wife, and
939987 [12502] suddenly went back to the entrance.
939987 [12503] 
939987 [12504] â€œI wonâ€™t go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven,
939987 [12505] brothers?â€
939987 [12506] 
939987 [12507] â€œWe shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?â€
939987 [12508] 
939987 [12509] â€œAt once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?â€
939987 [12510] 
939987 [12511] â€œTo be sure. Mitri here will.â€
939987 [12512] 
939987 [12513] â€œCan you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my fatherâ€™s, to Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [12514] Karamazov, and tell him I havenâ€™t gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?â€
939987 [12515] 
939987 [12516] â€œOf course I can. Iâ€™ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.â€
939987 [12517] 
939987 [12518] â€œAnd hereâ€™s something for you, for I dare say he wonâ€™t give you anything,â€
939987 [12519] said Ivan, laughing gayly.
939987 [12520] 
939987 [12521] â€œYou may depend on it he wonâ€™t.â€ Mitya laughed too. â€œThank you, sir. Iâ€™ll
939987 [12522] be sure to do it.â€
939987 [12523] 
939987 [12524] At seven oâ€™clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow â€œAway with
939987 [12525] the past. Iâ€™ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news,
939987 [12526] no echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!â€ But
939987 [12527] instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart
939987 [12528] ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was
939987 [12529] thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he
939987 [12530] was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.
939987 [12531] 
939987 [12532] â€œI am a scoundrel,â€ he whispered to himself.
939987 [12533] 
939987 [12534] Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For
939987 [12535] two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. But
939987 [12536] suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for
939987 [12537] every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [12538] equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell
939987 [12539] down from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the
939987 [12540] yard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his
939987 [12541] screamâ€”the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to herâ€”the scream of
939987 [12542] the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had
939987 [12543] come on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must
939987 [12544] have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had
939987 [12545] caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them. They
939987 [12546] found him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and
939987 [12547] foaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have broken
939987 [12548] somethingâ€”an arm or a legâ€”and hurt himself, but â€œGod had preserved him,â€
939987 [12549] as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed itâ€”nothing of the kind had happened. But it
939987 [12550] was difficult to get him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to
939987 [12551] help and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the
939987 [12552] whole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man did
939987 [12553] not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then
939987 [12554] began again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as
939987 [12555] had happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret.
939987 [12556] They remembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was still
939987 [12557] ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the
939987 [12558] evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at
939987 [12559] once. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and
939987 [12560] conscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, he
939987 [12561] concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious
939987 [12562] consequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it,
939987 [12563] but that by to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he
939987 [12564] would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the lodge,
939987 [12565] to a room next to Grigoryâ€™s and Marfa Ignatyevnaâ€™s.
939987 [12566] 
939987 [12567] Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with
939987 [12568] that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared with
939987 [12569] Smerdyakovâ€™s, was â€œno better than dish-water,â€ and the fowl was so dried
939987 [12570] up that it was impossible to masticate it. To her masterâ€™s bitter, though
939987 [12571] deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very
939987 [12572] old one to begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. In
939987 [12573] the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he
939987 [12574] was informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days,
939987 [12575] was completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea
939987 [12576] as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He was in
939987 [12577] terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [12578] coming almost as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning
939987 [12579] an assurance â€œthat she had promised to come without fail.â€ The
939987 [12580] incorrigible old manâ€™s heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and
939987 [12581] down his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be
939987 [12582] on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window
939987 [12583] (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where
939987 [12584] and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a
939987 [12585] second in the passage, for fearâ€”which God forbid!â€”that she should be
939987 [12586] frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never
939987 [12587] had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could
939987 [12588] say almost certainly that she would come!

939987 [12596] 
939987 [12597] Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors
939987 [12598] 
939987 [12599] 
939987 [12600] When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elderâ€™s cell,
939987 [12601] he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp,
939987 [12602] perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up
939987 [12603] in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and
939987 [12604] cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful
939987 [12605] conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour
939987 [12606] before Alyoshaâ€™s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell
939987 [12607] earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident
939987 [12608] assurance from Father PaÃ¯ssy that â€œthe teacher would get up, and as he had
939987 [12609] himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his
939987 [12610] heart.â€ This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father
939987 [12611] PaÃ¯ssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious, if he had
939987 [12612] seen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise that he would rise up
939987 [12613] and say good-by to him, he would not have believed perhaps even in death,
939987 [12614] but would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill his
939987 [12615] promise. In the morning as he lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told
939987 [12616] him positively: â€œI shall not die without the delight of another
939987 [12617] conversation with you, beloved of my heart. I shall look once more on your
939987 [12618] dear face and pour out my heart to you once again.â€ The monks, who had
939987 [12619] gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had all
939987 [12620] been his devoted friends for many years. There were four of them: Father
939987 [12621] Iosif and Father PaÃ¯ssy, Father MihaÃ¯l, the warden of the hermitage, a man
939987 [12622] not very old and far from being learned. He was of humble origin, of
939987 [12623] strong will and steadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deep
939987 [12624] tenderness, though he obviously concealed it as though he were almost
939987 [12625] ashamed of it. The fourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little
939987 [12626] monk of the poorest peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very
939987 [12627] quiet, scarcely speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble,
939987 [12628] and looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful
939987 [12629] beyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great affection
939987 [12630] for this timorous man, and always treated him with marked respect, though
939987 [12631] perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less, in spite
939987 [12632] of the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him.
939987 [12633] That was very long ago, forty years before, when Father Zossima first
939987 [12634] began his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and
939987 [12635] when, shortly after, he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to
939987 [12636] collect alms for their poor monastery.
939987 [12637] 
939987 [12638] The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, was
939987 [12639] very small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them (in
939987 [12640] addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit round Father Zossima on
939987 [12641] chairs brought from the sitting-room. It was already beginning to get
939987 [12642] dark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the
939987 [12643] ikons.
939987 [12644] 
939987 [12645] Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima smiled
939987 [12646] at him joyfully and held out his hand.
939987 [12647] 
939987 [12648] â€œWelcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew you
939987 [12649] would come.â€
939987 [12650] 
939987 [12651] Alyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and wept.
939987 [12652] Something surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering, he wanted to
939987 [12653] sob.
939987 [12654] 
939987 [12655] â€œCome, donâ€™t weep over me yet,â€ Father Zossima smiled, laying his right
939987 [12656] hand on his head. â€œYou see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall live
939987 [12657] another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, with
939987 [12658] her little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday. God bless the mother
939987 [12659] and the little girl Lizaveta,â€ he crossed himself. â€œPorfiry, did you take
939987 [12660] her offering where I told you?â€
939987 [12661] 
939987 [12662] He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good-humored
939987 [12663] woman to be given â€œto some one poorer than me.â€ Such offerings, always of
939987 [12664] money gained by personal toil, are made by way of penance voluntarily
939987 [12665] undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow,
939987 [12666] whose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone
939987 [12667] with her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had
939987 [12668] given the money, as he had been instructed, â€œfrom an unknown
939987 [12669] benefactress.â€
939987 [12670] 
939987 [12671] â€œGet up, my dear boy,â€ the elder went on to Alyosha. â€œLet me look at you.
939987 [12672] Have you been home and seen your brother?â€ It seemed strange to Alyosha
939987 [12673] that he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothers
939987 [12674] onlyâ€”but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and
939987 [12675] to-day for the sake of that brother.
939987 [12676] 
939987 [12677] â€œI have seen one of my brothers,â€ answered Alyosha.
939987 [12678] 
939987 [12679] â€œI mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.â€
939987 [12680] 
939987 [12681] â€œI only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [12682] 
939987 [12683] â€œMake haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste, leave
939987 [12684] everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent
939987 [12685] something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store
939987 [12686] for him.â€
939987 [12687] 
939987 [12688] He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange.
939987 [12689] Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances
939987 [12690] with Father PaÃ¯ssy. Alyosha could not resist asking:
939987 [12691] 
939987 [12692] â€œFather and teacher,â€ he began with extreme emotion, â€œyour words are too
939987 [12693] obscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?â€
939987 [12694] 
939987 [12695] â€œDonâ€™t inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though
939987 [12696] his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came into his eyesâ€”so
939987 [12697] that I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing for
939987 [12698] himself. Once or twice in my life Iâ€™ve seen such a look in a manâ€™s face
939987 [12699] ... reflecting as it were his future fate, and that fate, alas, came to
939987 [12700] pass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I thought your brotherly face would
939987 [12701] help him. But everything and all our fates are from the Lord. â€˜Except a
939987 [12702] corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it
939987 [12703] die, it bringeth forth much fruit.â€™ Remember that. You, Alexey, Iâ€™ve many
939987 [12704] times silently blessed for your face, know that,â€ added the elder with a
939987 [12705] gentle smile. â€œThis is what I think of you, you will go forth from these
939987 [12706] walls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have many enemies,
939987 [12707] but even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes,
939987 [12708] but you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will
939987 [12709] make others bless itâ€”which is what matters most. Well, that is your
939987 [12710] character. Fathers and teachers,â€ he addressed his friends with a tender
939987 [12711] smile, â€œI have never till to-day told even him why the face of this youth
939987 [12712] is so dear to me. Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were a
939987 [12713] remembrance and a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a
939987 [12714] child I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And
939987 [12715] later on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that
939987 [12716] brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For had he
939987 [12717] not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, have
939987 [12718] become a monk and entered on this precious path. He appeared first to me
939987 [12719] in my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he seems to have
939987 [12720] come to me over again. It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey,
939987 [12721] who has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like
939987 [12722] him spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that young man, my
939987 [12723] brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a
939987 [12724] reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so strange a
939987 [12725] dream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?â€ he turned to the novice who
939987 [12726] waited on him. â€œMany times Iâ€™ve seen in your face as it were a look of
939987 [12727] mortification that I love Alexey more than you. Now you know why that was
939987 [12728] so, but I love you too, know that, and many times I grieved at your
939987 [12729] mortification. I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my
939987 [12730] brother, for there has been no presence in my life more precious, more
939987 [12731] significant and touching. My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my
939987 [12732] whole life at this moment as though living through it again.â€
939987 [12733] 
939987 [12734]                   -------------------------------------
939987 [12735] 
939987 [12736] Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with the
939987 [12737] friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partly
939987 [12738] preserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down from
939987 [12739] memory, some time after his elderâ€™s death. But whether this was only the
939987 [12740] conversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of
939987 [12741] parts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his
939987 [12742] account, Father Zossimaâ€™s talk goes on without interruption, as though he
939987 [12743] told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no
939987 [12744] doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was
939987 [12745] general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they
939987 [12746] too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father
939987 [12747] Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was
939987 [12748] sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down
939987 [12749] to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not
939987 [12750] leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by
939987 [12751] Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one
939987 [12752] of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his
939987 [12753] life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new
939987 [12754] strength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a
939987 [12755] last effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little
939987 [12756] time, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that
939987 [12757] later. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the
939987 [12758] account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not
939987 [12759] so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great
939987 [12760] deal from previous conversations and added them to it.

939987 [12767] BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES
939987 [12768] 
939987 [12769] _(a)_ _Father Zossimaâ€™s Brother_
939987 [12770] 
939987 [12771] Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the
939987 [12772] north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no
939987 [12773] great consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old, and
939987 [12774] I donâ€™t remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built of
939987 [12775] wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and her
939987 [12776] children in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I.
939987 [12777] He was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but
939987 [12778] kind-hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at
939987 [12779] home with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did
939987 [12780] not get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so
939987 [12781] my mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen,
939987 [12782] he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow
939987 [12783] to our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was a
939987 [12784] good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university.
939987 [12785] Something made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see
939987 [12786] him. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter,
939987 [12787] till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his
939987 [12788] own request, as he had powerful friends.
939987 [12789] 
939987 [12790] It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude and
939987 [12791] laughed at it. â€œThatâ€™s all silly twaddle, and there is no God,â€ he said,
939987 [12792] horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was only
939987 [12793] nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four servants, all
939987 [12794] serfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, who
939987 [12795] was lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant
939987 [12796] to take her place.
939987 [12797] 
939987 [12798] In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a
939987 [12799] tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin and
939987 [12800] delicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he caught
939987 [12801] cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it was
939987 [12802] galloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring. My
939987 [12803] mother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she entreated
939987 [12804] him to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he was still
939987 [12805] able to move about. This made him angry, and he said something profane
939987 [12806] about the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he
939987 [12807] was seriously ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to
939987 [12808] confess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long time
939987 [12809] past, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed at
939987 [12810] dinner to our mother and me, â€œMy life wonâ€™t be long among you, I may not
939987 [12811] live another year,â€ which seemed now like a prophecy.
939987 [12812] 
939987 [12813] Three days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning my
939987 [12814] brother began going to church. â€œI am doing this simply for your sake,
939987 [12815] mother, to please and comfort you,â€ he said. My mother wept with joy and
939987 [12816] grief. â€œHis end must be near,â€ she thought, â€œif thereâ€™s such a change in
939987 [12817] him.â€ But he was not able to go to church long, he took to his bed, so he
939987 [12818] had to confess and take the sacrament at home.
939987 [12819] 
939987 [12820] It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of
939987 [12821] fragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly, but in
939987 [12822] the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair. Thatâ€™s how I
939987 [12823] remember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his face bright and
939987 [12824] joyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change passed over him, his
939987 [12825] spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and say, â€œLet me
939987 [12826] light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.â€ And once he would not have
939987 [12827] allowed it and would have blown it out.
939987 [12828] 
939987 [12829] â€œLight it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it.
939987 [12830] You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoice
939987 [12831] seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.â€
939987 [12832] 
939987 [12833] Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her room and
939987 [12834] weep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful.
939987 [12835] â€œMother, donâ€™t weep, darling,â€ he would say, â€œIâ€™ve long to live yet, long
939987 [12836] to rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.â€
939987 [12837] 
939987 [12838] â€œAh, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night,
939987 [12839] coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.â€
939987 [12840] 
939987 [12841] â€œDonâ€™t cry, mother,â€ he would answer, â€œlife is paradise, and we are all in
939987 [12842] paradise, but we wonâ€™t see it, if we would, we should have heaven on earth
939987 [12843] the next day.â€
939987 [12844] 
939987 [12845] Every one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively; we
939987 [12846] were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us. â€œDear ones,â€ he would
939987 [12847] say to them, â€œwhat have I done that you should love me so, how can you
939987 [12848] love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate
939987 [12849] it before?â€
939987 [12850] 
939987 [12851] When the servants came in to him he would say continually, â€œDear, kind
939987 [12852] people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? If
939987 [12853] it were Godâ€™s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should
939987 [12854] wait on one another.â€
939987 [12855] 
939987 [12856] Mother shook her head as she listened. â€œMy darling, itâ€™s your illness
939987 [12857] makes you talk like that.â€
939987 [12858] 
939987 [12859] â€œMother, darling,â€ he would say, â€œthere must be servants and masters, but
939987 [12860] if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.
939987 [12861] And another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, and
939987 [12862] I more than any.â€
939987 [12863] 
939987 [12864] Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. â€œWhy, how
939987 [12865] could you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers and
939987 [12866] murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you
939987 [12867] hold yourself more guilty than all?â€
939987 [12868] 
939987 [12869] â€œMother, little heart of mine,â€ he said (he had begun using such strange
939987 [12870] caressing words at that time), â€œlittle heart of mine, my joy, believe me,
939987 [12871] every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.
939987 [12872] I donâ€™t know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfully
939987 [12873] even. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and not
939987 [12874] knowing?â€
939987 [12875] 
939987 [12876] So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full of
939987 [12877] love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came:
939987 [12878] 
939987 [12879] â€œWell, doctor, have I another day in this world?â€ he would ask, joking.
939987 [12880] 
939987 [12881] â€œYouâ€™ll live many days yet,â€ the doctor would answer, â€œand months and
939987 [12882] years too.â€
939987 [12883] 
939987 [12884] â€œMonths and years!â€ he would exclaim. â€œWhy reckon the days? One day is
939987 [12885] enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we quarrel,
939987 [12886] try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other? Letâ€™s go
939987 [12887] straight into the garden, walk and play there, love, appreciate, and kiss
939987 [12888] each other, and glorify life.â€
939987 [12889] 
939987 [12890] â€œYour son cannot last long,â€ the doctor told my mother, as she accompanied
939987 [12891] him to the door. â€œThe disease is affecting his brain.â€
939987 [12892] 
939987 [12893] The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our garden was a
939987 [12894] shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The first
939987 [12895] birds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing at
939987 [12896] the windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began suddenly
939987 [12897] begging their forgiveness too: â€œBirds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me,
939987 [12898] for I have sinned against you too.â€ None of us could understand that at
939987 [12899] the time, but he shed tears of joy. â€œYes,â€ he said, â€œthere was such a
939987 [12900] glory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in
939987 [12901] shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.â€
939987 [12902] 
939987 [12903] â€œYou take too many sins on yourself,â€ mother used to say, weeping.
939987 [12904] 
939987 [12905] â€œMother, darling, itâ€™s for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though I canâ€™t
939987 [12906] explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I donâ€™t know
939987 [12907] how to love them enough. If I have sinned against every one, yet all
939987 [12908] forgive me, too, and thatâ€™s heaven. Am I not in heaven now?â€
939987 [12909] 
939987 [12910] And there was a great deal more I donâ€™t remember. I remember I went once
939987 [12911] into his room when there was no one else there. It was a bright evening,
939987 [12912] the sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He beckoned me,
939987 [12913] and I went up to him. He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my
939987 [12914] face tenderly, lovingly; he said nothing for a minute, only looked at me
939987 [12915] like that.
939987 [12916] 
939987 [12917] â€œWell,â€ he said, â€œrun and play now, enjoy life for me too.â€
939987 [12918] 
939987 [12919] I went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life afterwards I
939987 [12920] remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too. There
939987 [12921] were many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his, though we did not
939987 [12922] understand them at the time. He died the third week after Easter. He was
939987 [12923] fully conscious though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did not
939987 [12924] change. He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,
939987 [12925] beckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his
939987 [12926] death. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so,
939987 [12927] though I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then, a child, but
939987 [12928] a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my heart,
939987 [12929] ready to rise up and respond when the time came. So indeed it happened.
939987 [12930] 
939987 [12931] _(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima_
939987 [12932] 
939987 [12933] I was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her to send me
939987 [12934] to Petersburg as other parents did. â€œYou have only one son now,â€ they
939987 [12935] said, â€œand have a fair income, and you will be depriving him perhaps of a
939987 [12936] brilliant career if you keep him here.â€ They suggested I should be sent to
939987 [12937] Petersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might afterwards enter the Imperial
939987 [12938] Guard. My mother hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her
939987 [12939] only child, but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without
939987 [12940] many tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me to
939987 [12941] Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again. For
939987 [12942] she too died three years afterwards. She spent those three years mourning
939987 [12943] and grieving for both of us.
939987 [12944] 
939987 [12945] From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious
939987 [12946] memories, for there are no memories more precious than those of early
939987 [12947] childhood in oneâ€™s first home. And that is almost always so if there is
939987 [12948] any love and harmony in the family at all. Indeed, precious memories may
939987 [12949] remain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what is
939987 [12950] precious. With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible,
939987 [12951] which, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of
939987 [12952] Scripture history then with excellent pictures, called _A Hundred and Four
939987 [12953] Stories from the Old and New Testament_, and I learned to read from it. I
939987 [12954] have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious relic of the past.
939987 [12955] But even before I learned to read, I remember first being moved to
939987 [12956] devotional feeling at eight years old. My mother took me alone to mass (I
939987 [12957] donâ€™t remember where my brother was at the time) on the Monday before
939987 [12958] Easter. It was a fine day, and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now,
939987 [12959] how the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and,
939987 [12960] overhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that
939987 [12961] streamed in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the
939987 [12962] first time in my life I consciously received the seed of Godâ€™s word in my
939987 [12963] heart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book,
939987 [12964] so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry it. He laid it
939987 [12965] on the reading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for the
939987 [12966] first time I understood something read in the church of God. In the land
939987 [12967] of Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he had great
939987 [12968] wealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted,
939987 [12969] and he loved them very much and prayed for them. â€œIt may be that my sons
939987 [12970] have sinned in their feasting.â€ Now the devil came before the Lord
939987 [12971] together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up
939987 [12972] and down the earth and under the earth. â€œAnd hast thou considered my
939987 [12973] servant Job?â€ God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil, pointing to
939987 [12974] his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at Godâ€™s words. â€œGive
939987 [12975] him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Thee
939987 [12976] and curse Thy name.â€ And God gave up the just man He loved so, to the
939987 [12977] devil. And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered his
939987 [12978] wealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his
939987 [12979] mantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, â€œNaked came I out of
939987 [12980] my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gave
939987 [12981] and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and
939987 [12982] ever.â€
939987 [12983] 
939987 [12984] Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises up
939987 [12985] again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of
939987 [12986] a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder and
939987 [12987] gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, who
939987 [12988] talked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up to destruction,
939987 [12989] and His servant crying out: â€œBlessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish
939987 [12990] me,â€ and then the soft and sweet singing in the church: â€œLet my prayer
939987 [12991] rise up before Thee,â€ and again incense from the priestâ€™s censer and the
939987 [12992] kneeling and the prayer. Ever since thenâ€”only yesterday I took it upâ€”Iâ€™ve
939987 [12993] never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much that
939987 [12994] is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard
939987 [12995] the words of mockery and blame, proud words, â€œHow could God give up the
939987 [12996] most loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his
939987 [12997] children, smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption
939987 [12998] from his sores with a pot-sherdâ€”and for no object except to boast to the
939987 [12999] devil! â€˜See what My saint can suffer for My sake.â€™ â€ But the greatness of
939987 [13000] it lies just in the fact that it is a mysteryâ€”that the passing earthly
939987 [13001] show and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of the
939987 [13002] earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as on
939987 [13003] the first days of creation He ended each day with praise: â€œThat is good
939987 [13004] that I have created,â€ looks upon Job and again praises His creation. And
939987 [13005] Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His creation for
939987 [13006] generations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he was
939987 [13007] ordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are in
939987 [13008] it! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with
939987 [13009] it to man! It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature,
939987 [13010] everything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what
939987 [13011] mysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him wealth
939987 [13012] again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. But
939987 [13013] how could he love those new ones when those first children are no more,
939987 [13014] when he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy with
939987 [13015] those new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, he
939987 [13016] could. Itâ€™s the great mystery of human life that old grief passes
939987 [13017] gradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place
939987 [13018] of the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as
939987 [13019] before, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting,
939987 [13020] its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come
939987 [13021] with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy lifeâ€”and over
939987 [13022] all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life is
939987 [13023] ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my
939987 [13024] earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching
939987 [13025] life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind
939987 [13026] glowing and my heart weeping with joy.
939987 [13027] 
939987 [13028] Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one may
939987 [13029] hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village priests,
939987 [13030] are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their
939987 [13031] humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in printâ€”Iâ€™ve read it
939987 [13032] myselfâ€”that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people because
939987 [13033] of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics come and
939987 [13034] lead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because they have so
939987 [13035] little to live upon. May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so
939987 [13036] precious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say,
939987 [13037] if any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may
939987 [13038] be short of time, he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while
939987 [13039] with work and services, but still itâ€™s not all the time, even he has an
939987 [13040] hour a week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year round.
939987 [13041] Let him gather round him once a week, some hour in the evening, if only
939987 [13042] the children at firstâ€”the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin
939987 [13043] to come. Thereâ€™s no need to build halls for this, let him take them into
939987 [13044] his own cottage. They wonâ€™t spoil his cottage, they would only be there
939987 [13045] one hour. Let him open that book and begin reading it without grand words
939987 [13046] or superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly,
939987 [13047] being glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with
939987 [13048] attention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to
939987 [13049] explain words that are not understood by the peasants. Donâ€™t be anxious,
939987 [13050] they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand all!
939987 [13051] Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of how
939987 [13052] Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said,
939987 [13053] â€œThis place is holyâ€â€”and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant.
939987 [13054] Let him read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph,
939987 [13055] the tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their
939987 [13056] father that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him his
939987 [13057] blood-stained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers afterwards
939987 [13058] journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler,
939987 [13059] unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother
939987 [13060] Benjamin, and all through love: â€œI love you, and loving you I torment
939987 [13061] you.â€ For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the
939987 [13062] merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands,
939987 [13063] he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a
939987 [13064] strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them
939987 [13065] beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them
939987 [13066] at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his
939987 [13067] bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and
939987 [13068] told them, â€œBrothers, I am your brother Joseph!â€ Let him read them further
939987 [13069] how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive,
939987 [13070] and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign
939987 [13071] land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in
939987 [13072] his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, from
939987 [13073] Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour.
939987 [13074] 
939987 [13075] Fathers and teachers, forgive me and donâ€™t be angry, that like a little
939987 [13076] child Iâ€™ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a
939987 [13077] hundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive my
939987 [13078] tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the priest of God, and be
939987 [13079] sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response. Only a
939987 [13080] little tiny seed is neededâ€”drop it into the heart of the peasant and it
939987 [13081] wonâ€™t die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be hidden in the
939987 [13082] midst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder.
939987 [13083] And thereâ€™s no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it
939987 [13084] all simply. Do you suppose that the peasants donâ€™t understand? Try reading
939987 [13085] them the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or the
939987 [13086] miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Donâ€™t forget either the parables
939987 [13087] of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke (that is what I
939987 [13088] did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paul
939987 [13089] (that you mustnâ€™t leave out on any account), and from the _Lives of the
939987 [13090] Saints_, for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of
939987 [13091] all, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egyptâ€”and you will
939987 [13092] penetrate their hearts with these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it
939987 [13093] in spite of your poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for
939987 [13094] yourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a
939987 [13095] hundred-fold. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words
939987 [13096] they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in his
939987 [13097] fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect than
939987 [13098] beforeâ€”so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too. The thing
939987 [13099] is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for
939987 [13100] fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believe
939987 [13101] in God will not believe in Godâ€™s people. He who believes in Godâ€™s people
939987 [13102] will see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it till
939987 [13103] then. Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our
939987 [13104] atheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil.
939987 [13105] 
939987 [13106] And what is the use of Christâ€™s words, unless we set an example? The
939987 [13107] people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the
939987 [13108] Word and for all that is good.
939987 [13109] 
939987 [13110] In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia
939987 [13111] with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one
939987 [13112] night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. A
939987 [13113] good-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry back
939987 [13114] next morning to pull a merchantâ€™s barge along the bank. I noticed him
939987 [13115] looking straight before him with clear and tender eyes. It was a bright,
939987 [13116] warm, still, July night, a cool mist rose from the broad river, we could
939987 [13117] hear the plash of a fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and
939987 [13118] beautiful, everything praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the
939987 [13119] lad and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world of Godâ€™s and of the
939987 [13120] great mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden
939987 [13121] bee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have not
939987 [13122] intelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually
939987 [13123] accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear ladâ€™s heart was moved. He told me
939987 [13124] that he loved the forest and the forest birds. He was a bird-catcher, knew
939987 [13125] the note of each of them, could call each bird. â€œI know nothing better
939987 [13126] than to be in the forest,â€ said he, â€œthough all things are good.â€
939987 [13127] 
939987 [13128] â€œTruly,â€ I answered him, â€œall things are good and fair, because all is
939987 [13129] truth. Look,â€ said I, â€œat the horse, that great beast that is so near to
939987 [13130] man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works for him; look at
939987 [13131] their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats them
939987 [13132] mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what beauty! Itâ€™s
939987 [13133] touching to know that thereâ€™s no sin in them, for all, all except man, is
939987 [13134] sinless, and Christ has been with them before us.â€
939987 [13135] 
939987 [13136] â€œWhy,â€ asked the boy, â€œis Christ with them too?â€
939987 [13137] 
939987 [13138] â€œIt cannot but be so,â€ said I, â€œsince the Word is for all. All creation
939987 [13139] and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory to
939987 [13140] God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of
939987 [13141] their sinless life. Yonder,â€ said I, â€œin the forest wanders the dreadful
939987 [13142] bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it.â€ And I told him how
939987 [13143] once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in
939987 [13144] the wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear and
939987 [13145] gave him a piece of bread. â€œGo along,â€ said he, â€œChrist be with you,â€ and
939987 [13146] the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm. And the
939987 [13147] lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint,
939987 [13148] and that Christ was with him too. â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œhow good that is, how
939987 [13149] good and beautiful is all Godâ€™s work!â€ He sat musing softly and sweetly. I
939987 [13150] saw he understood. And he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May
939987 [13151] God bless youth! And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace
939987 [13152] and light to Thy people!
939987 [13153]

939987 [13156] Chapter II. The Duel
939987 [13157] 
939987 [13158] 
939987 [13159] _(c) Recollections of Father Zossimaâ€™s Youth before he became a Monk. The
939987 [13160] Duel_
939987 [13161] 
939987 [13162] I spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school at
939987 [13163] Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of my
939987 [13164] childish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing. I picked up so
939987 [13165] many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd,
939987 [13166] almost savage creature. A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I
939987 [13167] did acquire together with the French language.
939987 [13168] 
939987 [13169] But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service as
939987 [13170] cattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was so
939987 [13171] much more impressionable than my companions. By the time we left the
939987 [13172] school as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor of
939987 [13173] the regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of
939987 [13174] honor, and if any one had known it, he would have been the first to
939987 [13175] ridicule it. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almost
939987 [13176] prided ourselves on. I donâ€™t say that we were bad by nature, all these
939987 [13177] young men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.
939987 [13178] What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I
939987 [13179] flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the
939987 [13180] recklessness of youth.
939987 [13181] 
939987 [13182] I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I
939987 [13183] never opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and I
939987 [13184] was never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book â€œfor
939987 [13185] the day and the hour, for the month and the year,â€ though I knew it not.
939987 [13186] 
939987 [13187] After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our
939987 [13188] regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town
939987 [13189] hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial
939987 [13190] reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be
939987 [13191] well off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a
939987 [13192] circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.
939987 [13193] 
939987 [13194] I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble
939987 [13195] and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They were
939987 [13196] well-to-do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial
939987 [13197] and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with
939987 [13198] favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully
939987 [13199] realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all,
939987 [13200] but only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I could
939987 [13201] not indeed have helped doing. I was prevented, however, from making her an
939987 [13202] offer at the time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the
939987 [13203] allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my
939987 [13204] youth, and with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to my
939987 [13205] feelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a time.
939987 [13206] Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to another
939987 [13207] district.
939987 [13208] 
939987 [13209] On my return two months later, I found the young lady already married to a
939987 [13210] rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though older
939987 [13211] than I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I was not,
939987 [13212] and of excellent education, which I also was not. I was so overwhelmed at
939987 [13213] this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded. The
939987 [13214] worst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had been
939987 [13215] a long while betrothed to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her
939987 [13216] house, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this
939987 [13217] particularly mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while
939987 [13218] I knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With flushed
939987 [13219] face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring my
939987 [13220] love to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me, she
939987 [13221] must, I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time. Later on, of
939987 [13222] course, I reflected and remembered that she had been very far from
939987 [13223] laughing at me; on the contrary, she used to turn off any love-making on
939987 [13224] my part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects; but at that
939987 [13225] moment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I
939987 [13226] am surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were
939987 [13227] extremely repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found
939987 [13228] it difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work
939987 [13229] myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.
939987 [13230] 
939987 [13231] I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my â€œrivalâ€ in the
939987 [13232] presence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly extraneous
939987 [13233] pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public eventâ€”it was in
939987 [13234] the year 1826(5)â€”and my jeer was, so people said, clever and effective.
939987 [13235] Then I forced him to ask for an explanation, and behaved so rudely that he
939987 [13236] accepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us, as I was
939987 [13237] younger, a person of no consequence, and of inferior rank. I learned
939987 [13238] afterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also
939987 [13239] that my challenge was accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his
939987 [13240] wifeâ€™s account before their marriage; he fancied now that if he submitted
939987 [13241] to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heard
939987 [13242] of it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him. I
939987 [13243] soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those days
939987 [13244] though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashion
939987 [13245] among the officersâ€”so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice
939987 [13246] sometimes be.
939987 [13247] 
939987 [13248] It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven oâ€™clock
939987 [13249] the next day on the outskirts of the townâ€”and then something happened that
939987 [13250] in very truth was the turning-point of my life. In the evening, returning
939987 [13251] home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly
939987 [13252] Afanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with all my might, so that it
939987 [13253] was covered with blood. He had not long been in my service and I had
939987 [13254] struck him before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me,
939987 [13255] though itâ€™s forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went
939987 [13256] to bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was
939987 [13257] breaking. I got upâ€”I did not want to sleep any moreâ€”I went to the
939987 [13258] windowâ€”opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it
939987 [13259] was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
939987 [13260] 
939987 [13261] â€œWhatâ€™s the meaning of it?â€ I thought. â€œI feel in my heart as it were
939987 [13262] something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,â€
939987 [13263] I thought, â€œI feel itâ€™s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death,
939987 [13264] afraid of being killed? No, thatâ€™s not it, thatâ€™s not it at all.â€... And
939987 [13265] all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the
939987 [13266] evening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated
939987 [13267] over again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face
939987 [13268] and he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed
939987 [13269] upon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even
939987 [13270] dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been
939987 [13271] brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime! It
939987 [13272] was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if I
939987 [13273] were struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and
939987 [13274] the birds were trilling the praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands,
939987 [13275] fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my
939987 [13276] brother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: â€œMy dear
939987 [13277] ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your waiting
939987 [13278] on me?â€
939987 [13279] 
939987 [13280] â€œYes, am I worth it?â€ flashed through my mind. â€œAfter all what am I worth,
939987 [13281] that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and image of
939987 [13282] God, should serve me?â€ For the first time in my life this question forced
939987 [13283] itself upon me. He had said, â€œMother, my little heart, in truth we are
939987 [13284] each responsible to all for all, itâ€™s only that men donâ€™t know this. If
939987 [13285] they knew it, the world would be a paradise at once.â€
939987 [13286] 
939987 [13287] â€œGod, can that too be false?â€ I thought as I wept. â€œIn truth, perhaps, I
939987 [13288] am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than all men
939987 [13289] in the world.â€ And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared
939987 [13290] to me; what was I going to do? I was going to kill a good, clever, noble
939987 [13291] man, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his wife of happiness for
939987 [13292] the rest of her life, I should be torturing and killing her too. I lay
939987 [13293] thus in my bed with my face in the pillow, heedless how the time was
939987 [13294] passing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch
939987 [13295] me.
939987 [13296] 
939987 [13297] â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œitâ€™s a good thing you are up already, itâ€™s time we were
939987 [13298] off, come along!â€
939987 [13299] 
939987 [13300] I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out to
939987 [13301] the carriage, however.
939987 [13302] 
939987 [13303] â€œWait here a minute,â€ I said to him. â€œIâ€™ll be back directly, I have
939987 [13304] forgotten my purse.â€
939987 [13305] 
939987 [13306] And I ran back alone, to Afanasyâ€™s little room.
939987 [13307] 
939987 [13308] â€œAfanasy,â€ I said, â€œI gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgive
939987 [13309] me,â€ I said.
939987 [13310] 
939987 [13311] He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw that
939987 [13312] it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officerâ€™s uniform, I
939987 [13313] dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.
939987 [13314] 
939987 [13315] â€œForgive me,â€ I said.
939987 [13316] 
939987 [13317] Then he was completely aghast.
939987 [13318] 
939987 [13319] â€œYour honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?â€
939987 [13320] 
939987 [13321] And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his hands,
939987 [13322] turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I flew out to my
939987 [13323] comrade and jumped into the carriage.
939987 [13324] 
939987 [13325] â€œReady,â€ I cried. â€œHave you ever seen a conqueror?â€ I asked him. â€œHere is
939987 [13326] one before you.â€
939987 [13327] 
939987 [13328] I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I donâ€™t remember what
939987 [13329] about.
939987 [13330] 
939987 [13331] He looked at me. â€œWell, brother, you are a plucky fellow, youâ€™ll keep up
939987 [13332] the honor of the uniform, I can see.â€
939987 [13333] 
939987 [13334] So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We were placed
939987 [13335] twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly, looking him full
939987 [13336] in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked lovingly at him, for I
939987 [13337] knew what I would do. His shot just grazed my cheek and ear.
939987 [13338] 
939987 [13339] â€œThank God,â€ I cried, â€œno man has been killed,â€ and I seized my pistol,
939987 [13340] turned back and flung it far away into the wood. â€œThatâ€™s the place for
939987 [13341] you,â€ I cried.
939987 [13342] 
939987 [13343] I turned to my adversary.
939987 [13344] 
939987 [13345] â€œForgive me, young fool that I am, sir,â€ I said, â€œfor my unprovoked insult
939987 [13346] to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten times worse than you
939987 [13347] and more, maybe. Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the
939987 [13348] world.â€
939987 [13349] 
939987 [13350] I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
939987 [13351] 
939987 [13352] â€œUpon my word,â€ cried my adversary, annoyed, â€œif you did not want to
939987 [13353] fight, why did not you let me alone?â€
939987 [13354] 
939987 [13355] â€œYesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,â€ I answered him gayly.
939987 [13356] 
939987 [13357] â€œAs to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to
939987 [13358] agree with your opinion,â€ said he.
939987 [13359] 
939987 [13360] â€œBravo,â€ I cried, clapping my hands. â€œI agree with you there too. I have
939987 [13361] deserved it!â€
939987 [13362] 
939987 [13363] â€œWill you shoot, sir, or not?â€
939987 [13364] 
939987 [13365] â€œNo, I wonâ€™t,â€ I said; â€œif you like, fire at me again, but it would be
939987 [13366] better for you not to fire.â€
939987 [13367] 
939987 [13368] The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: â€œCan you disgrace the
939987 [13369] regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness! If
939987 [13370] Iâ€™d only known this!â€
939987 [13371] 
939987 [13372] I stood facing them all, not laughing now.
939987 [13373] 
939987 [13374] â€œGentlemen,â€ I said, â€œis it really so wonderful in these days to find a
939987 [13375] man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing?â€
939987 [13376] 
939987 [13377] â€œBut not in a duel,â€ cried my second again.
939987 [13378] 
939987 [13379] â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s so strange,â€ I said. â€œFor I ought to have owned my fault as
939987 [13380] soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before leading him into a
939987 [13381] great and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque, that to act
939987 [13382] in that way would have been almost impossible, for only after I have faced
939987 [13383] his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any
939987 [13384] significance for him, and if I had spoken before, he would have said, â€˜He
939987 [13385] is a coward, the sight of the pistols has frightened him, no use to listen
939987 [13386] to him.â€™ Gentlemen,â€ I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart,
939987 [13387] â€œlook around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the
939987 [13388] tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we,
939987 [13389] are sinful and foolish, and we donâ€™t understand that life is heaven, for
939987 [13390] we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all
939987 [13391] its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.â€
939987 [13392] 
939987 [13393] I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the sweetness
939987 [13394] and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my heart as I had
939987 [13395] never known before in my life.
939987 [13396] 
939987 [13397] â€œAll this as rational and edifying,â€ said my antagonist, â€œand in any case
939987 [13398] you are an original person.â€
939987 [13399] 
939987 [13400] â€œYou may laugh,â€ I said to him, laughing too, â€œbut afterwards you will
939987 [13401] approve of me.â€
939987 [13402] 
939987 [13403] â€œOh, I am ready to approve of you now,â€ said he; â€œwill you shake hands?
939987 [13404] for I believe you are genuinely sincere.â€
939987 [13405] 
939987 [13406] â€œNo,â€ I said, â€œnot now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserve
939987 [13407] your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.â€
939987 [13408] 
939987 [13409] We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him. All
939987 [13410] my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass
939987 [13411] judgment on me the same day.
939987 [13412] 
939987 [13413] â€œHe has disgraced the uniform,â€ they said; â€œlet him resign his
939987 [13414] commission.â€
939987 [13415] 
939987 [13416] Some stood up for me: â€œHe faced the shot,â€ they said.
939987 [13417] 
939987 [13418] â€œYes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.â€
939987 [13419] 
939987 [13420] â€œIf he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own pistol
939987 [13421] first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into the forest.
939987 [13422] No, thereâ€™s something else in this, something original.â€
939987 [13423] 
939987 [13424] I enjoyed listening and looking at them. â€œMy dear friends and comrades,â€
939987 [13425] said I, â€œdonâ€™t worry about my resigning my commission, for I have done so
939987 [13426] already. I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my
939987 [13427] discharge I shall go into a monasteryâ€”itâ€™s with that object I am leaving
939987 [13428] the regiment.â€
939987 [13429] 
939987 [13430] When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.
939987 [13431] 
939987 [13432] â€œYou should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we canâ€™t
939987 [13433] judge a monk.â€
939987 [13434] 
939987 [13435] They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but kindly
939987 [13436] and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even those who had been
939987 [13437] sternest in their censure, and all the following month, before my
939987 [13438] discharge came, they could not make enough of me. â€œAh, you monk,â€ they
939987 [13439] would say. And every one said something kind to me, they began trying to
939987 [13440] dissuade me, even to pity me: â€œWhat are you doing to yourself?â€
939987 [13441] 
939987 [13442] â€œNo,â€ they would say, â€œhe is a brave fellow, he faced fire and could have
939987 [13443] fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before that he
939987 [13444] should become a monk, thatâ€™s why he did it.â€
939987 [13445] 
939987 [13446] It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I had been
939987 [13447] kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention, and now
939987 [13448] all came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me, but they
939987 [13449] loved me. I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel,
939987 [13450] the authorities took no notice of it, because my antagonist was a near
939987 [13451] relation of our general, and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious
939987 [13452] consequences, and as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And
939987 [13453] I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,
939987 [13454] for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations
939987 [13455] mostly took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women
939987 [13456] particularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
939987 [13457] 
939987 [13458] â€œBut how can I possibly be responsible for all?â€ every one would laugh in
939987 [13459] my face. â€œCan I, for instance, be responsible for you?â€
939987 [13460] 
939987 [13461] â€œYou may well not know it,â€ I would answer, â€œsince the whole world has
939987 [13462] long been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies as
939987 [13463] truth and demand the same lies from others. Here I have for once in my
939987 [13464] life acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman. Though
939987 [13465] you are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.â€
939987 [13466] 
939987 [13467] â€œBut how can we help being friendly to you?â€ said my hostess, laughing.
939987 [13468] The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young lady rose, on whose
939987 [13469] account the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to be
939987 [13470] my future wife. I had not noticed her coming into the room. She got up,
939987 [13471] came to me and held out her hand.
939987 [13472] 
939987 [13473] â€œLet me tell you,â€ she said, â€œthat I am the first not to laugh at you, but
939987 [13474] on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you for
939987 [13475] your action then.â€
939987 [13476] 
939987 [13477] Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almost
939987 [13478] kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was especially
939987 [13479] caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others. I knew him
939987 [13480] by name already, but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word
939987 [13481] with him till that evening.
939987 [13482] 
939987 [13483] _(d) The Mysterious Visitor_
939987 [13484] 
939987 [13485] He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent position,
939987 [13486] respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence. He subscribed
939987 [13487] considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum; he was very
939987 [13488] charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known after his
939987 [13489] death. He was a man of about fifty, almost stern in appearance and not
939987 [13490] much given to conversation. He had been married about ten years and his
939987 [13491] wife, who was still young, had borne him three children. Well, I was
939987 [13492] sitting alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenly
939987 [13493] opened and this gentleman walked in.
939987 [13494] 
939987 [13495] I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my former
939987 [13496] quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an old
939987 [13497] lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landladyâ€™s servant waited upon
939987 [13498] me, for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the
939987 [13499] duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt ashamed to look
939987 [13500] him in the face after my last interview with him. So prone is the man of
939987 [13501] the world to be ashamed of any righteous action.
939987 [13502] 
939987 [13503] â€œI have,â€ said my visitor, â€œwith great interest listened to you speaking
939987 [13504] in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make your
939987 [13505] personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately. Can you, dear
939987 [13506] sir, grant me this favor?â€
939987 [13507] 
939987 [13508] â€œI can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an honor.â€
939987 [13509] I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I impressed
939987 [13510] from the first moment by the appearance of this man. For though other
939987 [13511] people had listened to me with interest and attention, no one had come to
939987 [13512] me before with such a serious, stern and concentrated expression. And now
939987 [13513] he had come to see me in my own rooms. He sat down.
939987 [13514] 
939987 [13515] â€œYou are, I see, a man of great strength of character,â€ he said; â€œas you
939987 [13516] have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked incurring
939987 [13517] the contempt of all.â€
939987 [13518] 
939987 [13519] â€œYour praise is, perhaps, excessive,â€ I replied.
939987 [13520] 
939987 [13521] â€œNo, itâ€™s not excessive,â€ he answered; â€œbelieve me, such a course of
939987 [13522] action is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has
939987 [13523] impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,â€ he
939987 [13524] continued. â€œTell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps
939987 [13525] unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can recall
939987 [13526] them, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the
939987 [13527] duel. Do not think my question frivolous; on the contrary, I have in
939987 [13528] asking the question a secret motive of my own, which I will perhaps
939987 [13529] explain to you later on, if it is Godâ€™s will that we should become more
939987 [13530] intimately acquainted.â€
939987 [13531] 
939987 [13532] All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into the face
939987 [13533] and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on my
939987 [13534] side also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his soul.
939987 [13535] 
939987 [13536] â€œYou ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my
939987 [13537] opponentâ€™s forgiveness,â€ I answered; â€œbut I had better tell you from the
939987 [13538] beginning what I have not yet told any one else.â€ And I described all that
939987 [13539] had passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to the ground
939987 [13540] at his feet. â€œFrom that you can see for yourself,â€ I concluded, â€œthat at
939987 [13541] the time of the duel it was easier for me, for I had made a beginning
939987 [13542] already at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go farther
939987 [13543] along it was far from being difficult, but became a source of joy and
939987 [13544] happiness.â€
939987 [13545] 
939987 [13546] I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. â€œAll that,â€ he said, â€œis
939987 [13547] exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.â€
939987 [13548] 
939987 [13549] And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And we
939987 [13550] should have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of himself.
939987 [13551] But about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked me
939987 [13552] about myself. In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke with
939987 [13553] perfect frankness to him about all my feelings; â€œfor,â€ thought I, â€œwhat
939987 [13554] need have I to know his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a
939987 [13555] good man? Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he
939987 [13556] comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.â€ And I
939987 [13557] learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of
939987 [13558] lofty mind.
939987 [13559] 
939987 [13560] â€œThat life is heaven,â€ he said to me suddenly, â€œthat I have long been
939987 [13561] thinking aboutâ€; and all at once he added, â€œI think of nothing else
939987 [13562] indeed.â€ He looked at me and smiled. â€œI am more convinced of it than you
939987 [13563] are, I will tell you later why.â€
939987 [13564] 
939987 [13565] I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me
939987 [13566] something.
939987 [13567] 
939987 [13568] â€œHeaven,â€ he went on, â€œlies hidden within all of usâ€”here it lies hidden in
939987 [13569] me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all
939987 [13570] time.â€
939987 [13571] 
939987 [13572] I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
939987 [13573] mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.
939987 [13574] 
939987 [13575] â€œAnd that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins,
939987 [13576] you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you could
939987 [13577] comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very truth, so soon
939987 [13578] as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a
939987 [13579] dream, but a living reality.â€
939987 [13580] 
939987 [13581] â€œAnd when,â€ I cried out to him bitterly, â€œwhen will that come to pass? and
939987 [13582] will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?â€
939987 [13583] 
939987 [13584] â€œWhat then, you donâ€™t believe it,â€ he said. â€œYou preach it and donâ€™t
939987 [13585] believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to
939987 [13586] pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has its
939987 [13587] law. Itâ€™s a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to
939987 [13588] recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Until
939987 [13589] you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one,
939987 [13590] brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind
939987 [13591] of common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges
939987 [13592] with equal consideration for all. Every one will think his share too small
939987 [13593] and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.
939987 [13594] You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have
939987 [13595] to go through the period of isolation.â€
939987 [13596] 
939987 [13597] â€œWhat do you mean by isolation?â€ I asked him.
939987 [13598] 
939987 [13599] â€œWhy, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our ageâ€”it has
939987 [13600] not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one
939987 [13601] strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure
939987 [13602] the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his
939987 [13603] efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for
939987 [13604] instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All
939987 [13605] mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in
939987 [13606] his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has,
939987 [13607] from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.
939987 [13608] He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, â€˜How strong I am now and how
939987 [13609] secure,â€™ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps
939987 [13610] up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is
939987 [13611] accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the
939987 [13612] whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men
939987 [13613] and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and
939987 [13614] the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men
939987 [13615] have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to
939987 [13616] be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.
939987 [13617] But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will
939987 [13618] suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another.
939987 [13619] It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have
939987 [13620] sat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the
939987 [13621] Son of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keep
939987 [13622] the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his
939987 [13623] conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw menâ€™s
939987 [13624] souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love,
939987 [13625] that the great idea may not die.â€
939987 [13626] 
939987 [13627] Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and fervent
939987 [13628] talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently.
939987 [13629] Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as blame, for they
939987 [13630] still loved me and treated me good-humoredly, but thereâ€™s no denying that
939987 [13631] fashion is a great power in society. I began to regard my mysterious
939987 [13632] visitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his intelligence, I began to
939987 [13633] perceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart, and was
939987 [13634] preparing himself perhaps for a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not
939987 [13635] showing curiosity about his secret, not seeking to discover it by direct
939987 [13636] question nor by insinuation. But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show
939987 [13637] signs of wanting to tell me something. This had become quite evident,
939987 [13638] indeed, about a month after he first began to visit me.
939987 [13639] 
939987 [13640] â€œDo you know,â€ he said to me once, â€œthat people are very inquisitive about
939987 [13641] us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often. But let them
939987 [13642] wonder, for _soon all will be explained_.â€
939987 [13643] 
939987 [13644] Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and almost
939987 [13645] always on such occasions he would get up and go away. Sometimes he would
939987 [13646] fix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, â€œHe will say something
939987 [13647] directly now.â€ But he would suddenly begin talking of something ordinary
939987 [13648] and familiar. He often complained of headache too.
939987 [13649] 
939987 [13650] One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking with great
939987 [13651] fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his face worked
939987 [13652] convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.
939987 [13653] 
939987 [13654] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ I said; â€œdo you feel ill?â€â€”he had just been
939987 [13655] complaining of headache.
939987 [13656] 
939987 [13657] â€œI ... do you know ... I murdered some one.â€
939987 [13658] 
939987 [13659] He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. â€œWhy is it he is
939987 [13660] smiling?â€ The thought flashed through my mind before I realized anything
939987 [13661] else. I too turned pale.
939987 [13662] 
939987 [13663] â€œWhat are you saying?â€ I cried.
939987 [13664] 
939987 [13665] â€œYou see,â€ he said, with a pale smile, â€œhow much it has cost me to say the
939987 [13666] first word. Now I have said it, I feel Iâ€™ve taken the first step and shall
939987 [13667] go on.â€
939987 [13668] 
939987 [13669] For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him at
939987 [13670] that time, but only after he had been to see me three days running and
939987 [13671] told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended by being convinced,
939987 [13672] to my great grief and amazement. His crime was a great and terrible one.
939987 [13673] 
939987 [13674] Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner, a wealthy
939987 [13675] and handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He fell passionately
939987 [13676] in love with her, declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry
939987 [13677] him. But she had already given her heart to another man, an officer of
939987 [13678] noble birth and high rank in the service, who was at that time away at the
939987 [13679] front, though she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer
939987 [13680] and begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to visit her,
939987 [13681] he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through
939987 [13682] the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often happens,
939987 [13683] a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than
939987 [13684] others.
939987 [13685] 
939987 [13686] Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the ladder, knowing
939987 [13687] that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the negligence of
939987 [13688] the servants, left unlocked. He hoped to find it so, and so it was. He
939987 [13689] made his way in the dark to her bedroom, where a light was burning. As
939987 [13690] though on purpose, both her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the
939987 [13691] same street, without asking leave. The other servants slept in the
939987 [13692] servantsâ€™ quarters or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion
939987 [13693] flamed up at the sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger
939987 [13694] took possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he
939987 [13695] thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then with
939987 [13696] devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall on
939987 [13697] the servants. He was so base as to take her purse, to open her chest with
939987 [13698] keys from under her pillow, and to take some things from it, doing it all
939987 [13699] as it might have been done by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers
939987 [13700] and taking only money. He took some of the larger gold things, but left
939987 [13701] smaller articles that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too,
939987 [13702] some things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done
939987 [13703] this awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.
939987 [13704] 
939987 [13705] Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after in
939987 [13706] his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal. No one
939987 [13707] indeed knew of his love for her, for he was always reserved and silent and
939987 [13708] had no friend to whom he would have opened his heart. He was looked upon
939987 [13709] simply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of the murdered
939987 [13710] woman, as for the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf
939987 [13711] of hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance
939987 [13712] confirmed the suspicion. The man knewâ€”indeed his mistress did not conceal
939987 [13713] the factâ€”that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had decided
939987 [13714] to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct was unsatisfactory.
939987 [13715] People had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunk
939987 [13716] in a tavern. Two days before her death, he had run away, staying no one
939987 [13717] knew where in the town. The day after the murder, he was found on the road
939987 [13718] leading out of the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his
939987 [13719] right hand happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose
939987 [13720] had been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that they
939987 [13721] had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left open till they
939987 [13722] returned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwing
939987 [13723] suspicion on the innocent servant.
939987 [13724] 
939987 [13725] They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week after the
939987 [13726] arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the
939987 [13727] hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and
939987 [13728] every one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed
939987 [13729] by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital. And after that the
939987 [13730] punishment began.
939987 [13731] 
939987 [13732] My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he was not in
939987 [13733] the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable a long time,
939987 [13734] but not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the woman he
939987 [13735] loved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed his love,
939987 [13736] while the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the innocent
939987 [13737] blood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcely
939987 [13738] thought. The thought that his victim might have become the wife of another
939987 [13739] man was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in
939987 [13740] his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise.
939987 [13741] 
939987 [13742] At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness and
939987 [13743] death soon set his mind at rest, for the manâ€™s death was apparently (so he
939987 [13744] reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chill
939987 [13745] he had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunk
939987 [13746] on the damp ground. The theft of the money and other things troubled him
939987 [13747] little, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but
939987 [13748] to avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards
939987 [13749] subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for
939987 [13750] maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his
939987 [13751] conscience at rest about the theft, and itâ€™s a remarkable fact that for a
939987 [13752] long time he really was at peaceâ€”he told me this himself. He entered then
939987 [13753] upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a
939987 [13754] difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being a
939987 [13755] man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he
939987 [13756] tried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too,
939987 [13757] founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good
939987 [13758] deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a
939987 [13759] member of philanthropic societies.
939987 [13760] 
939987 [13761] At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of it
939987 [13762] was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl
939987 [13763] and soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely
939987 [13764] depression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his
939987 [13765] duty to his wife and children, he would escape from old memories
939987 [13766] altogether. But the very opposite of what he expected happened. He began,
939987 [13767] even in the first month of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the
939987 [13768] thought, â€œMy wife loves meâ€”but what if she knew?â€ When she first told him
939987 [13769] that she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. â€œI am giving life,
939987 [13770] but I have taken life.â€ Children came. â€œHow dare I love them, teach and
939987 [13771] educate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have shed blood.â€ They
939987 [13772] were splendid children, he longed to caress them; â€œand I canâ€™t look at
939987 [13773] their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.â€
939987 [13774] 
939987 [13775] At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his
939987 [13776] murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood that
939987 [13777] cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have awful dreams. But, being a
939987 [13778] man of fortitude, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking: â€œI shall
939987 [13779] expiate everything by this secret agony.â€ But that hope, too, was vain;
939987 [13780] the longer it went on, the more intense was his suffering.
939987 [13781] 
939987 [13782] He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though every one
939987 [13783] was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the more he was
939987 [13784] respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He confessed to me that he
939987 [13785] had thoughts of killing himself. But he began to be haunted by another
939987 [13786] ideaâ€”an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable,
939987 [13787] though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it
939987 [13788] off. He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all
939987 [13789] men that he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued
939987 [13790] him, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his whole
939987 [13791] heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would be
939987 [13792] at peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with terror, for how
939987 [13793] could he carry it out? And then came what happened at my duel.
939987 [13794] 
939987 [13795] â€œLooking at you, I have made up my mind.â€
939987 [13796] 
939987 [13797] I looked at him.
939987 [13798] 
939987 [13799] â€œIs it possible,â€ I cried, clasping my hands, â€œthat such a trivial
939987 [13800] incident could give rise to such a resolution in you?â€
939987 [13801] 
939987 [13802] â€œMy resolution has been growing for the last three years,â€ he answered,
939987 [13803] â€œand your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking at you, I
939987 [13804] reproached myself and envied you.â€ He said this to me almost sullenly.
939987 [13805] 
939987 [13806] â€œBut you wonâ€™t be believed,â€ I observed; â€œitâ€™s fourteen years ago.â€
939987 [13807] 
939987 [13808] â€œI have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.â€
939987 [13809] 
939987 [13810] Then I cried and kissed him.
939987 [13811] 
939987 [13812] â€œTell me one thing, one thing,â€ he said (as though it all depended upon
939987 [13813] me), â€œmy wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, and though my
939987 [13814] children wonâ€™t lose their rank and property, theyâ€™ll be a convictâ€™s
939987 [13815] children and for ever! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall
939987 [13816] leave in their hearts!â€
939987 [13817] 
939987 [13818] I said nothing.
939987 [13819] 
939987 [13820] â€œAnd to part from them, to leave them for ever? Itâ€™s for ever, you know,
939987 [13821] for ever!â€
939987 [13822] 
939987 [13823] I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt afraid.
939987 [13824] 
939987 [13825] â€œWell?â€ He looked at me.
939987 [13826] 
939987 [13827] â€œGo!â€ said I, â€œconfess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Your
939987 [13828] children will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of your
939987 [13829] resolution.â€
939987 [13830] 
939987 [13831] He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for more than
939987 [13832] a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still preparing
939987 [13833] himself, still unable to bring himself to the point. He made my heart
939987 [13834] ache. One day he would come determined and say fervently:
939987 [13835] 
939987 [13836] â€œI know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess. Fourteen
939987 [13837] years Iâ€™ve been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my punishment and
939987 [13838] begin to live. You can pass through the world doing wrong, but thereâ€™s no
939987 [13839] turning back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children.
939987 [13840] Good God, my children will understand, perhaps, what my punishment has
939987 [13841] cost me and will not condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth.â€
939987 [13842] 
939987 [13843] â€œAll will understand your sacrifice,â€ I said to him, â€œif not at once, they
939987 [13844] will understand later; for you have served truth, the higher truth, not of
939987 [13845] the earth.â€
939987 [13846] 
939987 [13847] And he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would come again,
939987 [13848] bitter, pale, sarcastic.
939987 [13849] 
939987 [13850] â€œEvery time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though to
939987 [13851] say, â€˜He has still not confessed!â€™ Wait a bit, donâ€™t despise me too much.
939987 [13852] Itâ€™s not such an easy thing to do, as you would think. Perhaps I shall not
939987 [13853] do it at all. You wonâ€™t go and inform against me then, will you?â€
939987 [13854] 
939987 [13855] And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid to
939987 [13856] look at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full of
939987 [13857] tears. I could not sleep at night.
939987 [13858] 
939987 [13859] â€œI have just come from my wife,â€ he went on. â€œDo you understand what the
939987 [13860] word â€˜wifeâ€™ means? When I went out, the children called to me, â€˜Good-by,
939987 [13861] father, make haste back to read _The Childrenâ€™s Magazine_ with us.â€™ No,
939987 [13862] you donâ€™t understand that! No one is wise from another manâ€™s woe.â€
939987 [13863] 
939987 [13864] His eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he struck the
939987 [13865] table with his fist so that everything on it dancedâ€”it was the first time
939987 [13866] he had done such a thing, he was such a mild man.
939987 [13867] 
939987 [13868] â€œBut need I?â€ he exclaimed, â€œmust I? No one has been condemned, no one has
939987 [13869] been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever. And Iâ€™ve been
939987 [13870] punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shanâ€™t be believed,
939987 [13871] they wonâ€™t believe my proofs. Need I confess, need I? I am ready to go on
939987 [13872] suffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only my wife and
939987 [13873] children may be spared. Will it be just to ruin them with me? Arenâ€™t we
939987 [13874] making a mistake? What is right in this case? And will people recognize
939987 [13875] it, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?â€
939987 [13876] 
939987 [13877] â€œGood Lord!â€ I thought to myself, â€œhe is thinking of other peopleâ€™s
939987 [13878] respect at such a moment!â€ And I felt so sorry for him then, that I
939987 [13879] believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him. I saw
939987 [13880] he was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as well as my
939987 [13881] mind what such a resolution meant.
939987 [13882] 
939987 [13883] â€œDecide my fate!â€ he exclaimed again.
939987 [13884] 
939987 [13885] â€œGo and confess,â€ I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I whispered
939987 [13886] it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table, the Russian
939987 [13887] translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John, chapter xii. verse 24:
939987 [13888] 
939987 [13889] â€œVerily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the
939987 [13890] ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
939987 [13891] fruit.â€
939987 [13892] 
939987 [13893] I had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.
939987 [13894] 
939987 [13895] â€œThatâ€™s true,â€ he said, but he smiled bitterly. â€œItâ€™s terrible the things
939987 [13896] you find in those books,â€ he said, after a pause. â€œItâ€™s easy enough to
939987 [13897] thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have been written by
939987 [13898] men?â€
939987 [13899] 
939987 [13900] â€œThe Holy Spirit wrote them,â€ said I.
939987 [13901] 
939987 [13902] â€œItâ€™s easy for you to prate,â€ he smiled again, this time almost with
939987 [13903] hatred.
939987 [13904] 
939987 [13905] I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him the
939987 [13906] Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:
939987 [13907] 
939987 [13908] â€œIt is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.â€
939987 [13909] 
939987 [13910] He read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all over.
939987 [13911] 
939987 [13912] â€œAn awful text,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s no denying youâ€™ve picked out fitting
939987 [13913] ones.â€ He rose from the chair. â€œWell!â€ he said, â€œgood-by, perhaps I shanâ€™t
939987 [13914] come again ... we shall meet in heaven. So I have been for fourteen years
939987 [13915] â€˜in the hands of the living God,â€™ thatâ€™s how one must think of those
939987 [13916] fourteen years. To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go.â€
939987 [13917] 
939987 [13918] I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dareâ€”his face
939987 [13919] was contorted and somber. He went away.
939987 [13920] 
939987 [13921] â€œGood God,â€ I thought, â€œwhat has he gone to face!â€ I fell on my knees
939987 [13922] before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God, our swift
939987 [13923] defender and helper. I was half an hour praying in tears, and it was late,
939987 [13924] about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again. I was
939987 [13925] surprised.
939987 [13926] 
939987 [13927] â€œWhere have you been?â€ I asked him.
939987 [13928] 
939987 [13929] â€œI think,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™ve forgotten something ... my handkerchief, I
939987 [13930] think.... Well, even if Iâ€™ve not forgotten anything, let me stay a
939987 [13931] little.â€
939987 [13932] 
939987 [13933] He sat down. I stood over him.
939987 [13934] 
939987 [13935] â€œYou sit down, too,â€ said he.
939987 [13936] 
939987 [13937] I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at me and
939987 [13938] suddenly smiledâ€”I remembered thatâ€”then he got up, embraced me warmly and
939987 [13939] kissed me.
939987 [13940] 
939987 [13941] â€œRemember,â€ he said, â€œhow I came to you a second time. Do you hear,
939987 [13942] remember it!â€
939987 [13943] 
939987 [13944] And he went out.
939987 [13945] 
939987 [13946] â€œTo-morrow,â€ I thought.
939987 [13947] 
939987 [13948] And so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was his
939987 [13949] birthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance of
939987 [13950] hearing it from any one. On that day he always had a great gathering,
939987 [13951] every one in the town went to it. It was the same this time. After dinner
939987 [13952] he walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his handâ€”a formal
939987 [13953] declaration to the chief of his department who was present. This
939987 [13954] declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly. It contained a full
939987 [13955] account of the crime, in every detail.
939987 [13956] 
939987 [13957] â€œI cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,â€ he said in
939987 [13958] conclusion. â€œI want to suffer for my sin!â€
939987 [13959] 
939987 [13960] Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been
939987 [13961] keeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his crime, the
939987 [13962] jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert
939987 [13963] suspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her
939987 [13964] betrothed in the locket, her notebook and two letters; one from her
939987 [13965] betrothed, telling her that he would soon be with her, and her unfinished
939987 [13966] answer left on the table to be sent off next day. He carried off these two
939987 [13967] lettersâ€”what for? Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards
939987 [13968] instead of destroying them as evidence against him?
939987 [13969] 
939987 [13970] And this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every one
939987 [13971] refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged, though all
939987 [13972] listened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was fully decided and
939987 [13973] agreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal authorities
939987 [13974] could not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped it. Though the
939987 [13975] trinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that even if they did
939987 [13976] turn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on those alone.
939987 [13977] Besides, she might have given him those things as a friend, or asked him
939987 [13978] to take care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that the
939987 [13979] genuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the
939987 [13980] murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet nothing was
939987 [13981] destined to come of it, after all.
939987 [13982] 
939987 [13983] Five days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was in
939987 [13984] danger. The nature of his illness I canâ€™t explain, they said it was an
939987 [13985] affection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors had been
939987 [13986] induced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also, and had come
939987 [13987] to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity. I betrayed nothing,
939987 [13988] though people ran to question me. But when I wanted to visit him, I was
939987 [13989] for a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his wife.
939987 [13990] 
939987 [13991] â€œItâ€™s you who have caused his illness,â€ she said to me; â€œhe was always
939987 [13992] gloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarly
939987 [13993] excited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him.
939987 [13994] Your preaching has brought him to this; for the last month he was always
939987 [13995] with you.â€
939987 [13996] 
939987 [13997] Indeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamed
939987 [13998] me. â€œItâ€™s all your doing,â€ they said. I was silent and indeed rejoiced at
939987 [13999] heart, for I saw plainly Godâ€™s mercy to the man who had turned against
939987 [14000] himself and punished himself. I could not believe in his insanity.
939987 [14001] 
939987 [14002] They let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good-by to me. I went
939987 [14003] in to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but his hours were
939987 [14004] numbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for breath,
939987 [14005] but his face was full of tender and happy feeling.
939987 [14006] 
939987 [14007] â€œIt is done!â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ve long been yearning to see you, why didnâ€™t you
939987 [14008] come?â€
939987 [14009] 
939987 [14010] I did not tell him that they would not let me see him.
939987 [14011] 
939987 [14012] â€œGod has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying,
939987 [14013] but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years. There was
939987 [14014] heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dare
939987 [14015] to love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife nor the judges, nor
939987 [14016] any one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I see
939987 [14017] in that Godâ€™s mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without a
939987 [14018] stain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heaven
939987 [14019] ... I have done my duty.â€
939987 [14020] 
939987 [14021] He could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly,
939987 [14022] looking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept peeping
939987 [14023] in at us. But he had time to whisper to me:
939987 [14024] 
939987 [14025] â€œDo you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? I
939987 [14026] told you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to kill
939987 [14027] you!â€
939987 [14028] 
939987 [14029] I started.
939987 [14030] 
939987 [14031] â€œI went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets,
939987 [14032] struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly
939987 [14033] bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he is my judge. I
939987 [14034] canâ€™t refuse to face my punishment to-morrow, for he knows all. It was not
939987 [14035] that I was afraid you would betray me (I never even thought of that), but
939987 [14036] I thought, â€˜How can I look him in the face if I donâ€™t confess?â€™ And if you
939987 [14037] had been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all
939987 [14038] the same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing
939987 [14039] everything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the cause, as
939987 [14040] though you were to blame for everything. I came back to you then,
939987 [14041] remembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I sat down and
939987 [14042] asked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I pondered. If I had killed
939987 [14043] you, I should have been ruined by that murder even if I had not confessed
939987 [14044] the other. But I didnâ€™t think about that at all, and I didnâ€™t want to
939987 [14045] think of it at that moment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myself
939987 [14046] on you for everything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let
939987 [14047] me tell you, you were never nearer death.â€
939987 [14048] 
939987 [14049] A week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave. The chief
939987 [14050] priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible illness
939987 [14051] that had cut short his days. But all the town was up in arms against me
939987 [14052] after the funeral, and people even refused to see me. Some, at first a few
939987 [14053] and afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the truth of his story,
939987 [14054] and they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness,
939987 [14055] for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But I
939987 [14056] held my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months
939987 [14057] later by Godâ€™s grace I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praising
939987 [14058] the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember in
939987 [14059] my prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered so
939987 [14060] greatly.
939987 [14061] 
939987 [14062] 
939987 [14063] 
939987 [14064] Chapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossima
939987 [14065] 
939987 [14066] 
939987 [14067] _(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance_
939987 [14068] 
939987 [14069] Fathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world the word
939987 [14070] is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others it is
939987 [14071] used as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is growing. It is
939987 [14072] true, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards, gluttons,
939987 [14073] profligates and insolent beggars among monks. Educated people point to
939987 [14074] these: â€œYou are idlers, useless members of society, you live on the labor
939987 [14075] of others, you are shameless beggars.â€ And yet how many meek and humble
939987 [14076] monks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! These
939987 [14077] are less noticed, or passed over in silence. And how surprised men would
939987 [14078] be if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary
939987 [14079] prayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more! For they are
939987 [14080] in truth made ready in peace and quiet â€œfor the day and the hour, the
939987 [14081] month and the year.â€ Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image of
939987 [14082] Christ fair and undefiled, in the purity of Godâ€™s truth, from the times of
939987 [14083] the Fathers of old, the Apostles and the martyrs. And when the time comes
939987 [14084] they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world. That is a great
939987 [14085] thought. That star will rise out of the East.
939987 [14086] 
939987 [14087] That is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at the
939987 [14088] worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has not
939987 [14089] Godâ€™s image and His truth been distorted in them? They have science; but
939987 [14090] in science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. The spiritual
939987 [14091] world, the higher part of manâ€™s being is rejected altogether, dismissed
939987 [14092] with a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The world has proclaimed the
939987 [14093] reign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom
939987 [14094] of theirs? Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:
939987 [14095] 
939987 [14096] â€œYou have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the
939987 [14097] most rich and powerful. Donâ€™t be afraid of satisfying them and even
939987 [14098] multiply your desires.â€ That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that
939987 [14099] they see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication of
939987 [14100] desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy
939987 [14101] and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the
939987 [14102] means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting
939987 [14103] more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community,
939987 [14104] as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.
939987 [14105] 
939987 [14106] Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom as the
939987 [14107] multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their own
939987 [14108] nature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous
939987 [14109] fancies are fostered in them. They live only for mutual envy, for luxury
939987 [14110] and ostentation. To have dinners, visits, carriages, rank and slaves to
939987 [14111] wait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which life, honor and human
939987 [14112] feeling are sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable to
939987 [14113] satisfy it. We see the same thing among those who are not rich, while the
939987 [14114] poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness. But soon
939987 [14115] they will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to it. I ask
939987 [14116] you is such a man free? I knew one â€œchampion of freedomâ€ who told me
939987 [14117] himself that, when he was deprived of tobacco in prison, he was so
939987 [14118] wretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for
939987 [14119] the sake of getting tobacco again! And such a man says, â€œI am fighting for
939987 [14120] the cause of humanity.â€
939987 [14121] 
939987 [14122] How can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps of
939987 [14123] some action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And itâ€™s no wonder
939987 [14124] that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and instead
939987 [14125] of serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have
939987 [14126] fallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation, as my mysterious
939987 [14127] visitor and teacher said to me in my youth. And therefore the idea of the
939987 [14128] service of humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is
939987 [14129] more and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes
939987 [14130] treated with derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What can
939987 [14131] become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the
939987 [14132] innumerable desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and what
939987 [14133] concern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in
939987 [14134] accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown
939987 [14135] less.
939987 [14136] 
939987 [14137] The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer are
939987 [14138] laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom. I
939987 [14139] cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and
939987 [14140] wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with Godâ€™s help I attain
939987 [14141] freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most capable of
939987 [14142] conceiving a great idea and serving itâ€”the rich man in his isolation or
939987 [14143] the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and
939987 [14144] habits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, â€œYou have secluded
939987 [14145] yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, and
939987 [14146] have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!â€ But we shall see which
939987 [14147] will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but
939987 [14148] they, who are in isolation, though they donâ€™t see that. Of old, leaders of
939987 [14149] the people came from among us, and why should they not again? The same
939987 [14150] meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great
939987 [14151] cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people. And the Russian monk
939987 [14152] has always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if the
939987 [14153] people are isolated. The people believe as we do, and an unbelieving
939987 [14154] reformer will never do anything in Russia, even if he is sincere in heart
939987 [14155] and a genius. Remember that! The people will meet the atheist and overcome
939987 [14156] him, and Russia will be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and
939987 [14157] guard his heart. Go on educating him quietly. Thatâ€™s your duty as monks,
939987 [14158] for the peasant has God in his heart.
939987 [14159] 
939987 [14160] (_f_) _Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them to
939987 [14161] be Brothers in the Spirit_
939987 [14162] 
939987 [14163] Of course, I donâ€™t deny that there is sin in the peasants too. And the
939987 [14164] fire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from above
939987 [14165] downwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.
939987 [14166] Money-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. Already the
939987 [14167] merchant grows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show himself
939987 [14168] cultured though he has not a trace of culture, and to this end meanly
939987 [14169] despises his old traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of his
939987 [14170] fathers. He visits princes, though he is only a peasant corrupted. The
939987 [14171] peasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit. And
939987 [14172] what cruelty to their wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness!
939987 [14173] Iâ€™ve seen in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety,
939987 [14174] bent and already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, work
939987 [14175] all day long, the vile language and the drink, the drinkâ€”is that what a
939987 [14176] little childâ€™s heart needs? He needs sunshine, childish play, good
939987 [14177] examples all about him, and at least a little love. There must be no more
939987 [14178] of this, monks, no more torturing of children, rise up and preach that,
939987 [14179] make haste, make haste!
939987 [14180] 
939987 [14181] But God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and cannot
939987 [14182] renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and that they
939987 [14183] do wrong in sinning. So that our people still believe in righteousness,
939987 [14184] have faith in God and weep tears of devotion.
939987 [14185] 
939987 [14186] It is different with the upper classes. They, following science, want to
939987 [14187] base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and they
939987 [14188] have already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no sin. And
939987 [14189] thatâ€™s consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning of crime? In
939987 [14190] Europe the people are already rising up against the rich with violence,
939987 [14191] and the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed,
939987 [14192] and teaching them that their wrath is righteous. But their â€œwrath is
939987 [14193] accursed, for it is cruel.â€ But God will save Russia as He has saved her
939987 [14194] many times. Salvation will come from the people, from their faith and
939987 [14195] their meekness.
939987 [14196] 
939987 [14197] Fathers and teachers, watch over the peopleâ€™s faith and this will not be a
939987 [14198] dream. Iâ€™ve been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity,
939987 [14199] their true and seemly dignity. Iâ€™ve seen it myself, I can testify to it,
939987 [14200] Iâ€™ve seen it and marveled at it, Iâ€™ve seen it in spite of the degraded
939987 [14201] sins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry. They are not
939987 [14202] servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner
939987 [14203] and bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.
939987 [14204] â€œYou are rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, God
939987 [14205] bless you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact
939987 [14206] that I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.â€
939987 [14207] 
939987 [14208] In truth if they donâ€™t say this (for they donâ€™t know how to say this yet),
939987 [14209] that is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known it myself, and,
939987 [14210] would you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is, the more
939987 [14211] noticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them are for the
939987 [14212] most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness
939987 [14213] and indifference. But God will save His people, for Russia is great in her
939987 [14214] humility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future.
939987 [14215] It will come to pass, that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by
939987 [14216] being ashamed of his riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his
939987 [14217] humility, will understand and give way before him, will respond joyfully
939987 [14218] and kindly to his honorable shame. Believe me that it will end in that;
939987 [14219] things are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritual
939987 [14220] dignity of man, and that will only be understood among us. If we were
939987 [14221] brothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will never
939987 [14222] agree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and
939987 [14223] it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world. So may it
939987 [14224] be, so may it be!
939987 [14225] 
939987 [14226] Fathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my wanderings
939987 [14227] I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was eight years since
939987 [14228] I had parted from him. He chanced to see me in the market-place,
939987 [14229] recognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he was! He simply pounced
939987 [14230] on me: â€œMaster dear, is it you? Is it really you I see?â€ He took me home
939987 [14231] with him.
939987 [14232] 
939987 [14233] He was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two little
939987 [14234] children. He and his wife earned their living as costermongers in the
939987 [14235] market-place. His room was poor, but bright and clean. He made me sit
939987 [14236] down, set the samovar, sent for his wife, as though my appearance were a
939987 [14237] festival for them. He brought me his children: â€œBless them, Father.â€
939987 [14238] 
939987 [14239] â€œIs it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will pray for
939987 [14240] them. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since that
939987 [14241] day, for it all came from you,â€ said I. And I explained that to him as
939987 [14242] well as I could. And what do you think? The man kept gazing at me and
939987 [14243] could not believe that I, his former master, an officer, was now before
939987 [14244] him in such a guise and position; it made him shed tears.
939987 [14245] 
939987 [14246] â€œWhy are you weeping?â€ said I, â€œbetter rejoice over me, dear friend, whom
939987 [14247] I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.â€
939987 [14248] 
939987 [14249] He did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over me
939987 [14250] tenderly.
939987 [14251] 
939987 [14252] â€œWhat has became of your fortune?â€ he asked.
939987 [14253] 
939987 [14254] â€œI gave it to the monastery,â€ I answered; â€œwe live in common.â€
939987 [14255] 
939987 [14256] After tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he brought out half a
939987 [14257] rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble I saw him
939987 [14258] thrusting hurriedly into my hand: â€œThatâ€™s for you in your wanderings, it
939987 [14259] may be of use to you, Father.â€
939987 [14260] 
939987 [14261] I took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out rejoicing.
939987 [14262] And on my way I thought: â€œHere we are both now, he at home and I on the
939987 [14263] road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet smiling joyfully in
939987 [14264] the gladness of our hearts, remembering how God brought about our
939987 [14265] meeting.â€
939987 [14266] 
939987 [14267] I have never seen him again since then. I had been his master and he my
939987 [14268] servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts,
939987 [14269] there was a great human bond between us. I have thought a great deal about
939987 [14270] that, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that that grand
939987 [14271] and simple-hearted unity might in due time become universal among the
939987 [14272] Russian people? I believe that it will come to pass and that the time is
939987 [14273] at hand.
939987 [14274] 
939987 [14275] And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I was often
939987 [14276] angry with servants; â€œthe cook had served something too hot, the orderly
939987 [14277] had not brushed my clothes.â€ But what taught me better then was a thought
939987 [14278] of my dear brotherâ€™s, which I had heard from him in childhood: â€œAm I worth
939987 [14279] it, that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty
939987 [14280] and ignorance?â€ And I wondered at the time that such simple and
939987 [14281] self-evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds.
939987 [14282] 
939987 [14283] It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act so
939987 [14284] that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant.
939987 [14285] And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him see it, and
939987 [14286] that without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his? Why should not
939987 [14287] my servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take him into my family
939987 [14288] and rejoice in doing so? Even now this can be done, but it will lead to
939987 [14289] the grand unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servants
939987 [14290] for himself, or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he
939987 [14291] does now, but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the
939987 [14292] servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.
939987 [14293] 
939987 [14294] And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only in deeds
939987 [14295] of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in gluttony,
939987 [14296] fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one with the
939987 [14297] other? I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand.
939987 [14298] People laugh and ask: â€œWhen will that time come and does it look like
939987 [14299] coming?â€ I believe that with Christâ€™s help we shall accomplish this great
939987 [14300] thing. And how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man
939987 [14301] which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when their
939987 [14302] destined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth.
939987 [14303] So it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, and
939987 [14304] all men will say: â€œThe stone which the builders rejected has become the
939987 [14305] corner-stone of the building.â€
939987 [14306] 
939987 [14307] And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when will
939987 [14308] you build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone,
939987 [14309] without Christ? If they declare that it is they who are advancing towards
939987 [14310] unity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one may
939987 [14311] positively marvel at such simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic
939987 [14312] dreams than we. They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by
939987 [14313] flooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that
939987 [14314] taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not for
939987 [14315] Christâ€™s covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last two
939987 [14316] men on earth. And those two last men would not be able to restrain each
939987 [14317] other in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself.
939987 [14318] And that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that
939987 [14319] for the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.
939987 [14320] 
939987 [14321] While I was still wearing an officerâ€™s uniform after my duel, I talked
939987 [14322] about servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed at
939987 [14323] me. â€œWhat!â€ they asked, â€œare we to make our servants sit down on the sofa
939987 [14324] and offer them tea?â€ And I answered them: â€œWhy not, sometimes at least?â€
939987 [14325] Every one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer was not
939987 [14326] clear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.
939987 [14327] 
939987 [14328] (_g_) _Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds_
939987 [14329] 
939987 [14330] Young man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer
939987 [14331] is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will
939987 [14332] give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an
939987 [14333] education. Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to
939987 [14334] yourself, â€œLord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to-day.â€ For
939987 [14335] every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and
939987 [14336] their souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude,
939987 [14337] unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether
939987 [14338] they have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth
939987 [14339] perhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew
939987 [14340] them not nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread
939987 [14341] before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one to
939987 [14342] pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! And
939987 [14343] God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much
939987 [14344] pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving and
939987 [14345] merciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake.
939987 [14346] 
939987 [14347] Brothers, have no fear of menâ€™s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for that
939987 [14348] is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all
939987 [14349] Godâ€™s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf,
939987 [14350] every ray of Godâ€™s light. Love the animals, love the plants, love
939987 [14351] everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery
939987 [14352] in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better
939987 [14353] every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an
939987 [14354] all-embracing love. Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of
939987 [14355] thought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble it, donâ€™t harass them, donâ€™t
939987 [14356] deprive them of their happiness, donâ€™t work against Godâ€™s intent. Man, do
939987 [14357] not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin,
939987 [14358] and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it,
939987 [14359] and leave the traces of your foulness after youâ€”alas, it is true of almost
939987 [14360] every one of us! Love children especially, for they too are sinless like
939987 [14361] the angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to
939987 [14362] guide us. Woe to him who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love
939987 [14363] children. The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the
939987 [14364] farthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could not pass
939987 [14365] by a child without emotion. Thatâ€™s the nature of the man.
939987 [14366] 
939987 [14367] At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of menâ€™s
939987 [14368] sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Always
939987 [14369] decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may
939987 [14370] subdue the whole world. Loving humility is marvelously strong, the
939987 [14371] strongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it.
939987 [14372] 
939987 [14373] Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watch
939987 [14374] yourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass by a little
939987 [14375] child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you
939987 [14376] may not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image,
939987 [14377] unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You donâ€™t know
939987 [14378] it, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and all
939987 [14379] because you were not careful before the child, because you did not foster
939987 [14380] in yourself a careful, actively benevolent love. Brothers, love is a
939987 [14381] teacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire,
939987 [14382] it is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor. For we must love not
939987 [14383] only occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one can love
939987 [14384] occasionally, even the wicked can.
939987 [14385] 
939987 [14386] My brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless, but it
939987 [14387] is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch
939987 [14388] in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It may be
939987 [14389] senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier at
939987 [14390] your sideâ€”a little happier, anywayâ€”and children and all animals, if you
939987 [14391] were nobler than you are now. Itâ€™s all like an ocean, I tell you. Then you
939987 [14392] would pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in a sort
939987 [14393] of transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your sin. Treasure
939987 [14394] this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.
939987 [14395] 
939987 [14396] My friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds of
939987 [14397] heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear not
939987 [14398] that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. Do not
939987 [14399] say, â€œSin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, and
939987 [14400] we are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away and
939987 [14401] hindering our good work from being done.â€ Fly from that dejection,
939987 [14402] children! There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and
939987 [14403] make yourself responsible for all menâ€™s sins, that is the truth, you know,
939987 [14404] friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for
939987 [14405] everything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and
939987 [14406] that you are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing your
939987 [14407] own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of
939987 [14408] Satan and murmuring against God.
939987 [14409] 
939987 [14410] Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth to
939987 [14411] comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to share
939987 [14412] it, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine. Indeed,
939987 [14413] many of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we cannot
939987 [14414] comprehend on earth. Let not that be a stumbling-block, and think not that
939987 [14415] it may serve as a justification to you for anything. For the Eternal Judge
939987 [14416] asks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will know
939987 [14417] that yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then and
939987 [14418] will not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and if
939987 [14419] it were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should be
939987 [14420] undone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the flood. Much
939987 [14421] on earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that we have been given a
939987 [14422] precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world, with the
939987 [14423] higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are not
939987 [14424] here but in other worlds. That is why the philosophers say that we cannot
939987 [14425] apprehend the reality of things on earth.
939987 [14426] 
939987 [14427] God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and His
939987 [14428] garden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what grows
939987 [14429] lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other
939987 [14430] mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you, the
939987 [14431] heavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be indifferent to life
939987 [14432] and even grow to hate it. Thatâ€™s what I think.
939987 [14433] 
939987 [14434] _(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End_
939987 [14435] 
939987 [14436] Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one. For no one
939987 [14437] can judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just such a criminal
939987 [14438] as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more than all men
939987 [14439] to blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will be able to be a
939987 [14440] judge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous
939987 [14441] myself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me. If
939987 [14442] you can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is
939987 [14443] judging, take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go without
939987 [14444] reproach. And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same
939987 [14445] spirit so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more
939987 [14446] bitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched,
939987 [14447] mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows his
939987 [14448] time has not yet come, but it will come in due course. And if it come not,
939987 [14449] no matter; if not he, then another in his place will understand and
939987 [14450] suffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled.
939987 [14451] Believe that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and
939987 [14452] faith of the saints.
939987 [14453] 
939987 [14454] Work without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to sleep, â€œI
939987 [14455] have not done what I ought to have done,â€ rise up at once and do it. If
939987 [14456] the people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you, fall
939987 [14457] down before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you are to blame
939987 [14458] for their not wanting to hear you. And if you cannot speak to them in
939987 [14459] their bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility, never losing
939987 [14460] hope. If all men abandon you and even drive you away by force, then when
939987 [14461] you are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears
939987 [14462] and it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in
939987 [14463] your solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you
939987 [14464] were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise
939987 [14465] God in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered togetherâ€”then there
939987 [14466] is a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace each other tenderly and
939987 [14467] praise God, for if only in you two His truth has been fulfilled.
939987 [14468] 
939987 [14469] If you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for your
939987 [14470] sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous man,
939987 [14471] rejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not sinned.
939987 [14472] 
939987 [14473] If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming
939987 [14474] distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above all
939987 [14475] things that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as though
939987 [14476] you were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering and bear it
939987 [14477] and your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too are
939987 [14478] guilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one
939987 [14479] man sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light,
939987 [14480] you would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might
939987 [14481] perhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though your
939987 [14482] light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm and
939987 [14483] doubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they were not
939987 [14484] saved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter,
939987 [14485] then their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when you
939987 [14486] are dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains. Men are always
939987 [14487] saved after the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay
939987 [14488] them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.
939987 [14489] You are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek no
939987 [14490] reward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which is
939987 [14491] only vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great nor the mighty,
939987 [14492] but be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know the times, study that.
939987 [14493] When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth and
939987 [14494] kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love.
939987 [14495] Love all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water the
939987 [14496] earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Donâ€™t be ashamed of
939987 [14497] that ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not
939987 [14498] given to many but only to the elect.
939987 [14499] 
939987 [14500] _(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_
939987 [14501] 
939987 [14502] Fathers and teachers, I ponder, â€œWhat is hell?â€ I maintain that it is the
939987 [14503] suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,
939987 [14504] immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his
939987 [14505] coming to earth, the power of saying, â€œI am and I love.â€ Once, only once,
939987 [14506] there was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for that was
939987 [14507] earthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And that happy
939987 [14508] creature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned
939987 [14509] it and remained callous. Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abrahamâ€™s
939987 [14510] bosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man
939987 [14511] and Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is
939987 [14512] just his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be
939987 [14513] brought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. For
939987 [14514] he sees clearly and says to himself, â€œNow I have understanding, and though
939987 [14515] I now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my
939987 [14516] love, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with a
939987 [14517] drop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the
939987 [14518] fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it
939987 [14519] on earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Even
939987 [14520] though I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for that
939987 [14521] life is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is a gulf
939987 [14522] fixed between that life and this existence.â€
939987 [14523] 
939987 [14524] They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I donâ€™t go into that mystery
939987 [14525] and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, they
939987 [14526] would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still
939987 [14527] greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that
939987 [14528] spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not
939987 [14529] external but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it
939987 [14530] would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the
939987 [14531] righteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called
939987 [14532] them up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their
939987 [14533] torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst
939987 [14534] for responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible. In the
939987 [14535] timidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of this
939987 [14536] impossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting the love
939987 [14537] of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it, by this
939987 [14538] submissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will attain at last,
939987 [14539] as it were, to a certain semblance of that active love which they scorned
939987 [14540] in life, to something like its outward expression.... I am sorry, friends
939987 [14541] and brothers, that I cannot express this clearly. But woe to those who
939987 [14542] have slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that there
939987 [14543] can be none more miserable then they. They tell us that it is a sin to
939987 [14544] pray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were, renounces them, but in
939987 [14545] my secret heart I believe that we may pray even for them. Love can never
939987 [14546] be an offense to Christ. For such as those I have prayed inwardly all my
939987 [14547] life, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray for them
939987 [14548] every day.
939987 [14549] 
939987 [14550] Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite of
939987 [14551] their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there are
939987 [14552] some fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his proud
939987 [14553] spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they are
939987 [14554] tortured by their own choice. For they have cursed themselves, cursing God
939987 [14555] and life. They live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in the
939987 [14556] desert sucking blood out of his own body. But they are never satisfied,
939987 [14557] and they refuse forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannot
939987 [14558] behold the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of
939987 [14559] life should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His own
939987 [14560] creation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and
939987 [14561] yearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain to death....
939987 [14562] 
939987 [14563]                   -------------------------------------
939987 [14564] 
939987 [14565] Here Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazovâ€™s manuscript ends. I repeat, it is
939987 [14566] incomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover only
939987 [14567] Father Zossimaâ€™s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we find
939987 [14568] brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions.
939987 [14569] His utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from
939987 [14570] the rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in
939987 [14571] Alexey Fyodorovitchâ€™s manuscript.
939987 [14572] 
939987 [14573] The elderâ€™s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although those
939987 [14574] who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was
939987 [14575] approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so
939987 [14576] suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing him
939987 [14577] that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there
939987 [14578] was at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five
939987 [14579] minutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was
939987 [14580] impossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his
939987 [14581] chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from
939987 [14582] their seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at
939987 [14583] them with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed
939987 [14584] his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful
939987 [14585] ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his
939987 [14586] soul to God.
939987 [14587] 
939987 [14588] The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the
939987 [14589] monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was
939987 [14590] from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient
939987 [14591] ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn
939987 [14592] the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was
939987 [14593] talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the
939987 [14594] monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only
939987 [14595] add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so
939987 [14596] strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the
939987 [14597] townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is
939987 [14598] still vividly remembered in the town.

939987 [14613] Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption
939987 [14614] 
939987 [14615] 
939987 [14616] The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the
939987 [14617] established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits
939987 [14618] are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: â€œIf any one of the
939987 [14619] monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it
939987 [14620] is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the
939987 [14621] cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the
939987 [14622] hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.â€ All this was done by
939987 [14623] Father PaÃ¯ssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and
939987 [14624] wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to
939987 [14625] allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head he
939987 [14626] put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and the
939987 [14627] dead manâ€™s face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was put an ikon
939987 [14628] of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been
939987 [14629] made ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the
939987 [14630] cell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors
939987 [14631] and fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest
939987 [14632] rule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks
939987 [14633] in holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after
939987 [14634] the requiem service. Father PaÃ¯ssy desired later on to read the Gospel all
939987 [14635] day and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the
939987 [14636] Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for
939987 [14637] something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even â€œunseemlyâ€ excitement and
939987 [14638] impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitors
939987 [14639] from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the
939987 [14640] town. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked. Both the
939987 [14641] Superintendent and Father PaÃ¯ssy did their utmost to calm the general
939987 [14642] bustle and agitation.
939987 [14643] 
939987 [14644] When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in most
939987 [14645] cases children, with them from the townâ€”as though they had been waiting
939987 [14646] expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the dead
939987 [14647] elderâ€™s remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately made
939987 [14648] manifest in accordance with their faith. It was only then apparent how
939987 [14649] unquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima during
939987 [14650] his lifetime as a great saint. And those who came were far from being all
939987 [14651] of the humbler classes.
939987 [14652] 
939987 [14653] This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such
939987 [14654] haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,
939987 [14655] impressed Father PaÃ¯ssy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen something
939987 [14656] of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything
939987 [14657] he had looked for. When he came across any of the monks who displayed this
939987 [14658] excitement, Father PaÃ¯ssy began to reprove them. â€œSuch immediate
939987 [14659] expectation of something extraordinary,â€ he said, â€œshows a levity,
939987 [14660] possible to worldly people but unseemly in us.â€
939987 [14661] 
939987 [14662] But little attention was paid him and Father PaÃ¯ssy noticed it uneasily.
939987 [14663] Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at the bottom
939987 [14664] of his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware
939987 [14665] of it, though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation around
939987 [14666] him, and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it was
939987 [14667] particularly unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presence
939987 [14668] aroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead manâ€™s cell he
939987 [14669] noticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached himself)
939987 [14670] the presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still
939987 [14671] staying in the monastery. Of both of them Father PaÃ¯ssy felt for some
939987 [14672] reason suddenly suspiciousâ€”though, indeed, he might well have felt the
939987 [14673] same about others.
939987 [14674] 
939987 [14675] The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited
939987 [14676] crowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking questions,
939987 [14677] everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was whispering with a
939987 [14678] peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest impatience
939987 [14679] and even a sort of irritation.
939987 [14680] 
939987 [14681] As for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitage
939987 [14682] at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that good-hearted
939987 [14683] but weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to the
939987 [14684] hermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she was
939987 [14685] overtaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitin
939987 [14686] to the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter
939987 [14687] every half-hour or so â€œ_everything that takes place_.â€ She regarded
939987 [14688] Rakitin as a most religious and devout young man. He was particularly
939987 [14689] clever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most
939987 [14690] to their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from
939987 [14691] doing so.
939987 [14692] 
939987 [14693] It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging about
939987 [14694] the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scattered
939987 [14695] here and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the hermitage,
939987 [14696] Father PaÃ¯ssy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen him for some
939987 [14697] time, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of him than he at
939987 [14698] once noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting
939987 [14699] on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his
939987 [14700] saintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to the
939987 [14701] wall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him,
939987 [14702] Father PaÃ¯ssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face
939987 [14703] hidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs.
939987 [14704] Father PaÃ¯ssy stood over him for a little.
939987 [14705] 
939987 [14706] â€œEnough, dear son, enough, dear,â€ he pronounced with feeling at last. â€œWhy
939987 [14707] do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Donâ€™t you know that this is the
939987 [14708] greatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!â€
939987 [14709] 
939987 [14710] Alyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with crying
939987 [14711] like a childâ€™s, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid
939987 [14712] his face in his hands again.
939987 [14713] 
939987 [14714] â€œMaybe it is well,â€ said Father PaÃ¯ssy thoughtfully; â€œweep if you must,
939987 [14715] Christ has sent you those tears.â€
939987 [14716] 
939987 [14717] â€œYour touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to
939987 [14718] gladden your dear heart,â€ he added to himself, walking away from Alyosha,
939987 [14719] and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however, for he felt
939987 [14720] that he too might weep looking at him.
939987 [14721] 
939987 [14722] Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems
939987 [14723] for the dead followed in their due course. Father PaÃ¯ssy again took Father
939987 [14724] Iosifâ€™s place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But before three
939987 [14725] oâ€™clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at
939987 [14726] the end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so
939987 [14727] contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has
939987 [14728] been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding
939987 [14729] neighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost
939987 [14730] repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and
939987 [14731] was such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the most
939987 [14732] natural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mention
939987 [14733] of it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the
939987 [14734] heart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha,
939987 [14735] forming a crisis and turning-point in his spiritual development, giving a
939987 [14736] shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his
939987 [14737] life and gave it a definite aim.
939987 [14738] 
939987 [14739] And so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father
939987 [14740] Zossimaâ€™s body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the
939987 [14741] question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the
939987 [14742] coffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and
939987 [14743] almost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed
939987 [14744] it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the
939987 [14745] body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if
939987 [14746] not a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For they
939987 [14747] expected something quite different.
939987 [14748] 
939987 [14749] And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first
939987 [14750] only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently
939987 [14751] each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three oâ€™clock
939987 [14752] those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly
939987 [14753] reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated
939987 [14754] to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in
939987 [14755] the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it,
939987 [14756] believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the
939987 [14757] believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for â€œmen
939987 [14758] love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,â€ as the deceased elder
939987 [14759] had said in one of his exhortations.
939987 [14760] 
939987 [14761] The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin,
939987 [14762] growing gradually more marked, and by three oâ€™clock it was quite
939987 [14763] unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal
939987 [14764] could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have
939987 [14765] been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after
939987 [14766] this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many
939987 [14767] years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they
939987 [14768] recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions.
939987 [14769] For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men,
939987 [14770] whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins,
939987 [14771] too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead
939987 [14772] bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.
939987 [14773] Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose
939987 [14774] memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition,
939987 [14775] showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as
939987 [14776] touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as
939987 [14777] something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by Godâ€™s grace, of
939987 [14778] still greater glory from their tombs in the future.
939987 [14779] 
939987 [14780] One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job,
939987 [14781] who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had
939987 [14782] been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was
939987 [14783] pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and
939987 [14784] mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb
939987 [14785] on which Father PaÃ¯ssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another
939987 [14786] memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy,
939987 [14787] who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the
939987 [14788] eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all
939987 [14789] the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these
939987 [14790] had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of
939987 [14791] decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light
939987 [14792] in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came
939987 [14793] from their bodies.
939987 [14794] 
939987 [14795] Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain
939987 [14796] the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin
939987 [14797] of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes
939987 [14798] were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostility
939987 [14799] to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy
939987 [14800] hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was
939987 [14801] jealousy of the dead manâ€™s saintliness, so firmly established during his
939987 [14802] lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though
939987 [14803] the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles,
939987 [14804] and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in
939987 [14805] fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so had
939987 [14806] come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery
939987 [14807] but in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but â€œWhy do they
939987 [14808] think him so saintly?â€ And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave
939987 [14809] rise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was
939987 [14810] why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition
939987 [14811] which came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the
939987 [14812] same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently
939987 [14813] devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted
939987 [14814] by this incident. This was how the thing happened.
939987 [14815] 
939987 [14816] As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of
939987 [14817] the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They went
939987 [14818] in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the
939987 [14819] crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook their heads
939987 [14820] mournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight which
939987 [14821] gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no one reproached
939987 [14822] them for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for
939987 [14823] the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it
939987 [14824] seemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand
939987 [14825] for a time.
939987 [14826] 
939987 [14827] Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went into
939987 [14828] the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went into
939987 [14829] the cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage.
939987 [14830] After three oâ€™clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and
939987 [14831] this was no doubt owing to the shocking news. People were attracted who
939987 [14832] would not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come,
939987 [14833] and among them were some personages of high standing. But external decorum
939987 [14834] was still preserved and Father PaÃ¯ssy, with a stern face, continued firmly
939987 [14835] and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what was
939987 [14836] taking place around him, though he had, in fact, observed something
939987 [14837] unusual long before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually
939987 [14838] louder and more confident, reached even him. â€œIt shows Godâ€™s judgment is
939987 [14839] not as manâ€™s,â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy heard suddenly. The first to give utterance
939987 [14840] to this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known
939987 [14841] to be a man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had
939987 [14842] long been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning
939987 [14843] conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction
939987 [14844] at that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon they
939987 [14845] began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they
939987 [14846] had a sort of right to discard it.
939987 [14847] 
939987 [14848] â€œAnd for what reason can _this_ have happened,â€ some of the monks said, at
939987 [14849] first with a show of regret; â€œhe had a small frame and his flesh was dried
939987 [14850] up on his bones, what was there to decay?â€
939987 [14851] 
939987 [14852] â€œIt must be a sign from heaven,â€ others hastened to add, and their opinion
939987 [14853] was adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out, too, that if
939987 [14854] the decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner,
939987 [14855] it would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-four
939987 [14856] hours, but this premature corruption â€œwas in excess of nature,â€ and so the
939987 [14857] finger of God was evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed
939987 [14858] irresistible.
939987 [14859] 
939987 [14860] Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead manâ€™s,
939987 [14861] tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that â€œthis is not held
939987 [14862] everywhere alike,â€ and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just
939987 [14863] was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that even
939987 [14864] in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatly
939987 [14865] confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of the
939987 [14866] glorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the color
939987 [14867] of the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have
939987 [14868] decayed in it. â€œAnd if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign
939987 [14869] that the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but
939987 [14870] black, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such gloryâ€”that is
939987 [14871] the belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has been
939987 [14872] preserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,â€ said Father
939987 [14873] Iosif in conclusion.
939987 [14874] 
939987 [14875] But the meek Fatherâ€™s words had little effect and even provoked a mocking
939987 [14876] retort. â€œThatâ€™s all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,â€ the
939987 [14877] monks decided. â€œWe stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts of
939987 [14878] innovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?â€ added others.
939987 [14879] 
939987 [14880] â€œWe have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the
939987 [14881] Turks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been impure
939987 [14882] and they have no bells even,â€ the most sneering added.
939987 [14883] 
939987 [14884] Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward his
939987 [14885] own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it
939987 [14886] himself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was
939987 [14887] beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little by
939987 [14888] little, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif.
939987 [14889] And so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with
939987 [14890] devout obedience the institution of the eldership were all at once
939987 [14891] terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one anotherâ€™s faces, when they
939987 [14892] met. Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty,
939987 [14893] held up their heads proudly. â€œThere was no smell of corruption from the
939987 [14894] late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,â€ they recalled malignantly.
939987 [14895] â€œBut he gained that glory not because he was an elder, but because he was
939987 [14896] a holy man.â€
939987 [14897] 
939987 [14898] And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father
939987 [14899] Zossima. â€œHis teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy and
939987 [14900] not a vale of tears,â€ said some of the more unreasonable. â€œHe followed the
939987 [14901] fashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in hell,â€ others,
939987 [14902] still more unreasonable, added. â€œHe was not strict in fasting, allowed
939987 [14903] himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send it
939987 [14904] to him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?â€ could be heard
939987 [14905] among some of the envious. â€œHe sat in pride,â€ the most malignant declared
939987 [14906] vindictively; â€œhe considered himself a saint and he took it as his due
939987 [14907] when people knelt before him.â€ â€œHe abused the sacrament of confession,â€
939987 [14908] the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious
939987 [14909] whisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in their
939987 [14910] devotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the
939987 [14911] deceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was
939987 [14912] terrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were not
939987 [14913] yet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this
939987 [14914] attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. â€œYes, clearly Father
939987 [14915] Ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday,â€ and at that moment Father
939987 [14916] Ferapont himself made his appearance, as though on purpose to increase the
939987 [14917] confusion.
939987 [14918] 
939987 [14919] I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the
939987 [14920] apiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglect
939987 [14921] on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the rules binding
939987 [14922] on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a
939987 [14923] choice about it. For it would have been discreditable to insist on
939987 [14924] burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day
939987 [14925] and night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, the
939987 [14926] monks would have said, â€œHe is holier than all of us and he follows a rule
939987 [14927] harder than ours. And if he does not go to church, itâ€™s because he knows
939987 [14928] when he ought to; he has his own rule.â€ It was to avoid the chance of
939987 [14929] these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.
939987 [14930] 
939987 [14931] As every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father
939987 [14932] Zossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that â€œGodâ€™s judgment
939987 [14933] is not the same as manâ€™s,â€ and that something had happened which was â€œin
939987 [14934] excess of nature.â€ It may well be supposed that among the first to run to
939987 [14935] him with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the
939987 [14936] evening before and left his cell terror-stricken.
939987 [14937] 
939987 [14938] I have mentioned above, that though Father PaÃ¯ssy, standing firm and
939987 [14939] immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see what
939987 [14940] was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in his heart,
939987 [14941] for he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken by it, but
939987 [14942] awaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and
939987 [14943] insight for the outcome of the general excitement.
939987 [14944] 
939987 [14945] Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of
939987 [14946] decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont
939987 [14947] appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him a
939987 [14948] crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not,
939987 [14949] however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to
939987 [14950] see what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certain
939987 [14951] awe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing.
939987 [14952] Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his
939987 [14953] right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped
939987 [14954] in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up the
939987 [14955] steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther
939987 [14956] back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding his
939987 [14957] hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:
939987 [14958] 
939987 [14959] â€œCasting out I cast out!â€ and, turning in all directions, he began at once
939987 [14960] making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of
939987 [14961] the cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately
939987 [14962] understood his action. For they knew he always did this wherever he went,
939987 [14963] and that he would not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out the
939987 [14964] evil spirits.
939987 [14965] 
939987 [14966] â€œSatan, go hence! Satan, go hence!â€ he repeated at each sign of the cross.
939987 [14967] â€œCasting out I cast out,â€ he roared again.
939987 [14968] 
939987 [14969] He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest, covered
939987 [14970] with gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet were bare.
939987 [14971] As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore under his
939987 [14972] gown could be heard clanking.
939987 [14973] 
939987 [14974] Father PaÃ¯ssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before him
939987 [14975] waiting.
939987 [14976] 
939987 [14977] â€œWhat have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against good
939987 [14978] order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?â€ he said at last,
939987 [14979] looking sternly at him.
939987 [14980] 
939987 [14981] â€œWhat have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?â€ shouted Father
939987 [14982] Ferapont crazily. â€œIâ€™ve come here to drive out your visitors, the unclean
939987 [14983] devils. Iâ€™ve come to see how many have gathered here while I have been
939987 [14984] away. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.â€
939987 [14985] 
939987 [14986] â€œYou cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him yourself,â€
939987 [14987] Father PaÃ¯ssy went on fearlessly. â€œAnd who can say of himself â€˜I am holyâ€™?
939987 [14988] Can you, Father?â€
939987 [14989] 
939987 [14990] â€œI am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not
939987 [14991] have them bow down to me as an idol,â€ thundered Father Ferapont. â€œNowadays
939987 [14992] folk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,â€ he turned to the
939987 [14993] crowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, â€œdid not believe in devils.
939987 [14994] He gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they have become as common
939987 [14995] as spiders in the corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that
939987 [14996] we see a great sign from God.â€
939987 [14997] 
939987 [14998] The incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in his
939987 [14999] dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits. When
939987 [15000] in the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima, the elder had
939987 [15001] advised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that was of no use,
939987 [15002] he advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special
939987 [15003] medicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as
939987 [15004] they talked over itâ€”and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the
939987 [15005] censorious had hastened to report this â€œextraordinaryâ€ counsel on the part
939987 [15006] of the elder.
939987 [15007] 
939987 [15008] â€œGo away, Father!â€ said Father PaÃ¯ssy, in a commanding voice, â€œitâ€™s not
939987 [15009] for man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a â€˜signâ€™ which neither
939987 [15010] you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and do
939987 [15011] not trouble the flock!â€ he repeated impressively.
939987 [15012] 
939987 [15013] â€œHe did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign
939987 [15014] has come. That is clear and itâ€™s a sin to hide it,â€ the fanatic, carried
939987 [15015] away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be quieted. â€œHe was
939987 [15016] seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in their pockets, he
939987 [15017] sipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with sweet things and his
939987 [15018] mind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is put to shame....â€
939987 [15019] 
939987 [15020] â€œYou speak lightly, Father.â€ Father PaÃ¯ssy, too, raised his voice. â€œI
939987 [15021] admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some
939987 [15022] frivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!â€
939987 [15023] Father PaÃ¯ssy thundered in conclusion.
939987 [15024] 
939987 [15025] â€œI will go,â€ said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as
939987 [15026] bitter. â€œYou learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my
939987 [15027] humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have forgotten
939987 [15028] what I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your
939987 [15029] subtlety.â€
939987 [15030] 
939987 [15031] Father PaÃ¯ssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont paused
939987 [15032] and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently, pronounced in a
939987 [15033] sing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:
939987 [15034] 
939987 [15035] â€œTo-morrow they will sing over him â€˜Our Helper and Defenderâ€™â€”a splendid
939987 [15036] anthemâ€”and over me when I die all theyâ€™ll sing will be â€˜What earthly
939987 [15037] joyâ€™â€”a little canticle,â€(6) he added with tearful regret. â€œYou are proud
939987 [15038] and puffed up, this is a vain place!â€ he shouted suddenly like a madman,
939987 [15039] and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the
939987 [15040] steps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once and
939987 [15041] some lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father PaÃ¯ssy, following
939987 [15042] Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. But the excited old
939987 [15043] fanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, he
939987 [15044] suddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, as
939987 [15045] though some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.
939987 [15046] 
939987 [15047] â€œMy God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!â€ he shouted
939987 [15048] frantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling face
939987 [15049] downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by his
939987 [15050] tears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up to him;
939987 [15051] there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed
939987 [15052] to take possession of them all.
939987 [15053] 
939987 [15054] â€œThis is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!â€ some
939987 [15055] cried aloud, losing their fear. â€œThis is he who should be an elder,â€
939987 [15056] others added malignantly.
939987 [15057] 
939987 [15058] â€œHe wouldnâ€™t be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldnâ€™t serve a
939987 [15059] cursed innovation ... he wouldnâ€™t imitate their foolery,â€ other voices
939987 [15060] chimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but
939987 [15061] at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossing
939987 [15062] themselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went
939987 [15063] back to his cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations which
939987 [15064] were utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater number
939987 [15065] dispersed, hastening to service. Father PaÃ¯ssy let Father Iosif read in
939987 [15066] his place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could not shake
939987 [15067] him, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special
939987 [15068] reason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly wondered, â€œWhy am I
939987 [15069] sad even to dejection?â€ and immediately grasped with surprise that his
939987 [15070] sudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowd
939987 [15071] thronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and he
939987 [15072] remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. â€œCan
939987 [15073] that boy mean so much to my heart now?â€ he asked himself, wondering.
939987 [15074] 
939987 [15075] At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the direction
939987 [15076] of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away his eyes and
939987 [15077] dropped them to the ground, and from the boyâ€™s look alone, Father PaÃ¯ssy
939987 [15078] guessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment.
939987 [15079] 
939987 [15080] â€œHave you, too, fallen into temptation?â€ cried Father PaÃ¯ssy. â€œCan you be
939987 [15081] with those of little faith?â€ he added mournfully.
939987 [15082] 
939987 [15083] Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father PaÃ¯ssy, but quickly turned
939987 [15084] his eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood sideways and
939987 [15085] did not turn his face to Father PaÃ¯ssy, who watched him attentively.
939987 [15086] 
939987 [15087] â€œWhere are you hastening? The bell calls to service,â€ he asked again, but
939987 [15088] again Alyosha gave no answer.
939987 [15089] 
939987 [15090] â€œAre you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without asking
939987 [15091] a blessing?â€
939987 [15092] 
939987 [15093] Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at
939987 [15094] the Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart and
939987 [15095] mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And suddenly,
939987 [15096] still without speaking, waved his hand, as though not caring even to be
939987 [15097] respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the
939987 [15098] hermitage.
939987 [15099] 
939987 [15100] â€œYou will come back again!â€ murmured Father PaÃ¯ssy, looking after him with
939987 [15101] sorrowful surprise.
939987 [15102] 
939987 [15103] 
939987 [15104] 
939987 [15105] Chapter II. A Critical Moment
939987 [15106] 
939987 [15107] 
939987 [15108] Father PaÃ¯ssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his â€œdear
939987 [15109] boyâ€ would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated
939987 [15110] with insight into the true meaning of Alyoshaâ€™s spiritual condition. Yet I
939987 [15111] must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear
939987 [15112] account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love
939987 [15113] so much. To Father PaÃ¯ssyâ€™s sorrowful question, â€œAre you too with those of
939987 [15114] little faith?â€ I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, â€œNo, he
939987 [15115] is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.â€ Indeed, all his
939987 [15116] trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the
939987 [15117] trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha
939987 [15118] thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days
939987 [15119] of his life. If the question is asked: â€œCould all his grief and
939987 [15120] disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elderâ€™s body had shown
939987 [15121] signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?â€
939987 [15122] I must answer without beating about the bush, â€œYes, it certainly was.â€ I
939987 [15123] would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my
939987 [15124] young heroâ€™s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or
939987 [15125] to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little
939987 [15126] progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare,
939987 [15127] on the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his
939987 [15128] heart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love
939987 [15129] was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little
939987 [15130] value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my
939987 [15131] hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by
939987 [15132] an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to
939987 [15133] be unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always
939987 [15134] sensible is to be suspected and is of little worthâ€”thatâ€™s my opinion!
939987 [15135] 
939987 [15136] â€œBut,â€ reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, â€œevery young man cannot
939987 [15137] believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.â€
939987 [15138] 
939987 [15139] To this I reply again, â€œYes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and
939987 [15140] steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.â€
939987 [15141] 
939987 [15142] Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not
939987 [15143] explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for
939987 [15144] the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not a
939987 [15145] question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of
939987 [15146] miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the
939987 [15147] triumph of some preconceived ideaâ€”oh, no, not at allâ€”what he saw before
939987 [15148] all was one figureâ€”the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that
939987 [15149] holy man whom he revered with such adoration. The fact is that all the
939987 [15150] love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and
939987 [15151] everything had, for the past year, been concentratedâ€”and perhaps wrongly
939987 [15152] soâ€”on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long
939987 [15153] been accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy
939987 [15154] could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the
939987 [15155] moment â€œof every one and everything.â€ He remembered afterwards how, on
939987 [15156] that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about
939987 [15157] whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten,
939987 [15158] too, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilushaâ€™s father, though he had so
939987 [15159] warmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not
939987 [15160] miracles he needed but only â€œthe higher justiceâ€ which had been in his
939987 [15161] belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his
939987 [15162] heart. And what does it signify that this â€œjusticeâ€ looked for by Alyosha
939987 [15163] inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the
939987 [15164] ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery cherished the
939987 [15165] same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha
939987 [15166] revered, Father PaÃ¯ssy himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubled
939987 [15167] by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And a
939987 [15168] whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this
939987 [15169] expectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted for,
939987 [15170] not simply miracles.
939987 [15171] 
939987 [15172] And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every one
939987 [15173] in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was his
939987 [15174] due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had judged him?
939987 [15175] Who could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung his
939987 [15176] inexperienced and virginal heart. He could not endure without
939987 [15177] mortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men
939987 [15178] should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the
939987 [15179] frivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles, had
939987 [15180] there been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why
939987 [15181] this humiliation, why this premature decay, â€œin excess of nature,â€ as the
939987 [15182] spiteful monks said? Why this â€œsign from heaven,â€ which they so
939987 [15183] triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did they
939987 [15184] believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the finger of
939987 [15185] Providence? Why did Providence hide its face â€œat the most critical momentâ€
939987 [15186] (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily submitting to the blind,
939987 [15187] dumb, pitiless laws of nature?
939987 [15188] 
939987 [15189] That was why Alyoshaâ€™s heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have said
939987 [15190] already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on
939987 [15191] earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This murmuring may have been
939987 [15192] shallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the third
939987 [15193] timeâ€”and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my
939987 [15194] feelingâ€”I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that
939987 [15195] moment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but,
939987 [15196] if love does not gain the upper hand in a boyâ€™s heart at such an
939987 [15197] exceptional moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention
939987 [15198] something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyoshaâ€™s mind
939987 [15199] at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing
939987 [15200] impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently
939987 [15201] haunted Alyoshaâ€™s mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that
939987 [15202] something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul
939987 [15203] had been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though
939987 [15204] he was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil
939987 [15205] impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly
939987 [15206] revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of
939987 [15207] his consciousness.
939987 [15208] 
939987 [15209] It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the
939987 [15210] hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards
939987 [15211] on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up
939987 [15212] and called him by his name.
939987 [15213] 
939987 [15214] â€œYou here, Alexey? Can you haveâ€”â€ he began wondering but broke off. He had
939987 [15215] meant to say, â€œCan you have come to this?â€
939987 [15216] 
939987 [15217] Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once
939987 [15218] saw that he heard and understood him.
939987 [15219] 
939987 [15220] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually
939987 [15221] passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.
939987 [15222] 
939987 [15223] â€œI say, Iâ€™ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly
939987 [15224] disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just look
939987 [15225] at me...â€
939987 [15226] 
939987 [15227] Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree. He
939987 [15228] was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his
939987 [15229] face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side of
939987 [15230] him.
939987 [15231] 
939987 [15232] â€œDo you know your face is quite changed? Thereâ€™s none of your famous
939987 [15233] mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been
939987 [15234] ill-treating you?â€
939987 [15235] 
939987 [15236] â€œLet me alone,â€ said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his hand,
939987 [15237] still looking away from him.
939987 [15238] 
939987 [15239] â€œOho! So thatâ€™s how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like other
939987 [15240] mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you have
939987 [15241] surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. Itâ€™s long since Iâ€™ve been surprised
939987 [15242] at anything here. I always took you for an educated man....â€
939987 [15243] 
939987 [15244] Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely
939987 [15245] understanding what he said.
939987 [15246] 
939987 [15247] â€œCan you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to
939987 [15248] stink? You donâ€™t mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to
939987 [15249] work miracles?â€ exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.
939987 [15250] 
939987 [15251] â€œI believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what more
939987 [15252] do you want?â€ cried Alyosha irritably.
939987 [15253] 
939987 [15254] â€œNothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen
939987 [15255] believes in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with your
939987 [15256] God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasnâ€™t given promotion, He hasnâ€™t
939987 [15257] bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!â€
939987 [15258] 
939987 [15259] Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, and there
939987 [15260] was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.
939987 [15261] 
939987 [15262] â€œI am not rebelling against my God; I simply â€˜donâ€™t accept His world.â€™ â€
939987 [15263] Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.
939987 [15264] 
939987 [15265] â€œHow do you mean, you donâ€™t accept the world?â€ Rakitin thought a moment
939987 [15266] over his answer. â€œWhat idiocy is this?â€
939987 [15267] 
939987 [15268] Alyosha did not answer.
939987 [15269] 
939987 [15270] â€œCome, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat
939987 [15271] to-day?â€
939987 [15272] 
939987 [15273] â€œI donâ€™t remember.... I think I have.â€
939987 [15274] 
939987 [15275] â€œYou need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look at
939987 [15276] you. You didnâ€™t sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in
939987 [15277] there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely youâ€™ve had
939987 [15278] nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. Iâ€™ve got some sausage in my
939987 [15279] pocket; Iâ€™ve brought it from the town in case of need, only you wonâ€™t eat
939987 [15280] sausage....â€
939987 [15281] 
939987 [15282] â€œGive me some.â€
939987 [15283] 
939987 [15284] â€œI say! You are going it! Why, itâ€™s a regular mutiny, with barricades!
939987 [15285] Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I
939987 [15286] shouldnâ€™t mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going
939987 [15287] too far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?â€
939987 [15288] 
939987 [15289] â€œGive me some vodka too.â€
939987 [15290] 
939987 [15291] â€œHullo! You surprise me, brother!â€ Rakitin looked at him in amazement.
939987 [15292] â€œWell, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chance
939987 [15293] and mustnâ€™t be missed. Come along.â€
939987 [15294] 
939987 [15295] Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.
939987 [15296] 
939987 [15297] â€œIf your little brother Ivan could see thisâ€”wouldnâ€™t he be surprised! By
939987 [15298] the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?â€
939987 [15299] 
939987 [15300] â€œYes,â€ answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his brother
939987 [15301] Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though it reminded
939987 [15302] him of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, some
939987 [15303] terrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him, did not
939987 [15304] reach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten.
939987 [15305] But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.
939987 [15306] 
939987 [15307] â€œYour brother Ivan declared once that I was a â€˜liberal booby with no
939987 [15308] talents whatsoever.â€™ Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I was
939987 [15309] â€˜dishonorable.â€™ Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense of
939987 [15310] honor will do for you now.â€ This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a
939987 [15311] whisper.
939987 [15312] 
939987 [15313] â€œListen!â€ he said aloud, â€œletâ€™s go by the path beyond the monastery
939987 [15314] straight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakovâ€™s by the way.
939987 [15315] Only fancy, Iâ€™ve written to tell her everything that happened, and would
939987 [15316] you believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has a
939987 [15317] passion for writing notes) that â€˜she would never have expected _such
939987 [15318] conduct_ from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.â€™ That
939987 [15319] was her very word: â€˜conduct.â€™ She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!â€
939987 [15320] he cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the
939987 [15321] shoulder made him stop too.
939987 [15322] 
939987 [15323] â€œDo you know, Alyosha,â€ he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed in
939987 [15324] a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was laughing
939987 [15325] outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, so
939987 [15326] difficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood
939987 [15327] in which he now saw Alyosha. â€œAlyosha, do you know where we had better
939987 [15328] go?â€ he brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly.
939987 [15329] 
939987 [15330] â€œI donâ€™t care ... where you like.â€
939987 [15331] 
939987 [15332] â€œLetâ€™s go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?â€ pronounced Rakitin at last,
939987 [15333] trembling with timid suspense.
939987 [15334] 
939987 [15335] â€œLetâ€™s go to Grushenka,â€ Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this prompt
939987 [15336] and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost started
939987 [15337] back.
939987 [15338] 
939987 [15339] â€œWell! I say!â€ he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the
939987 [15340] arm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change his
939987 [15341] mind.
939987 [15342] 
939987 [15343] They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.
939987 [15344] 
939987 [15345] â€œAnd how glad she will be, how delighted!â€ he muttered, but lapsed into
939987 [15346] silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was taking
939987 [15347] Alyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anything
939987 [15348] without a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case was
939987 [15349] twofold, first a revengeful desire to see â€œthe downfall of the righteous,â€
939987 [15350] and Alyoshaâ€™s fall â€œfrom the saints to the sinners,â€ over which he was
939987 [15351] already gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had in
939987 [15352] view a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said
939987 [15353] later.
939987 [15354] 
939987 [15355] â€œSo the critical moment has come,â€ he thought to himself with spiteful
939987 [15356] glee, â€œand we shall catch it on the hop, for itâ€™s just what we want.â€
939987 [15357] 
939987 [15358] 
939987 [15359] 
939987 [15360] Chapter III. An Onion
939987 [15361] 
939987 [15362] 
939987 [15363] Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedral
939987 [15364] square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house of
939987 [15365] the widow Morozov. The house was a large stone building of two stories,
939987 [15366] old and very ugly. The widow led a secluded life with her two unmarried
939987 [15367] nieces, who were also elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, but
939987 [15368] every one knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years
939987 [15369] before, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was known
939987 [15370] to be the girlâ€™s protector. It was said that the jealous old manâ€™s object
939987 [15371] in placing his â€œfavoriteâ€ with the widow Morozov was that the old woman
939987 [15372] should keep a sharp eye on her new lodgerâ€™s conduct. But this sharp eye
939987 [15373] soon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow Morozov seldom met
939987 [15374] Grushenka and did not worry her by looking after her in any way. It is
939987 [15375] true that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim,
939987 [15376] delicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town
939987 [15377] of the province, and much had happened since then. Little was known of the
939987 [15378] girlâ€™s history in the town and that little was vague. Nothing more had
939987 [15379] been learnt during the last four years, even after many persons had become
939987 [15380] interested in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna
939987 [15381] had meanwhile developed. There were rumors that she had been at seventeen
939987 [15382] betrayed by some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards
939987 [15383] abandoned by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married, while
939987 [15384] Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was said, however,
939987 [15385] that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man,
939987 [15386] Samsonov, she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical
939987 [15387] class, that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.
939987 [15388] 
939987 [15389] And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little orphan
939987 [15390] had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of bold and
939987 [15391] determined character, proud and insolent. She had a good head for
939987 [15392] business, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foul
939987 [15393] had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune. There was only
939987 [15394] one point on which all were agreed. Grushenka was not easily to be
939987 [15395] approached and except her aged protector there had not been one man who
939987 [15396] could boast of her favors during those four years. It was a positive fact,
939987 [15397] for there had been a good many, especially during the last two years, who
939987 [15398] had attempted to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been in
939987 [15399] vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and
939987 [15400] even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met
939987 [15401] from the strong-willed young person. It was known, too, that the young
939987 [15402] person had, especially of late, been given to what is called
939987 [15403] â€œspeculation,â€ and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction,
939987 [15404] so that many people began to say that she was no better than a Jew. It was
939987 [15405] not that she lent money on interest, but it was known, for instance, that
939987 [15406] she had for some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actually
939987 [15407] invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their
939987 [15408] nominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value.
939987 [15409] 
939987 [15410] The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and
939987 [15411] merciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the last year
939987 [15412] during which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs, he had
939987 [15413] fallen greatly under the influence of his protÃ©gÃ©e, whom he had at first
939987 [15414] kept strictly and in humble surroundings, â€œon Lenten fare,â€ as the wits
939987 [15415] said at the time. But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself,
939987 [15416] while she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity. The old
939987 [15417] man, now long since dead, had had a large business in his day and was also
939987 [15418] a noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenkaâ€™s hold
939987 [15419] upon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it had been so
939987 [15420] especially for the last two years), he did not settle any considerable
939987 [15421] fortune on her and would not have been moved to do so, if she had
939987 [15422] threatened to leave him. But he had presented her with a small sum, and
939987 [15423] even that was a surprise to every one when it became known.
939987 [15424] 
939987 [15425] â€œYou are a wench with brains,â€ he said to her, when he gave her eight
939987 [15426] thousand roubles, â€œand you must look after yourself, but let me tell you
939987 [15427] that except your yearly allowance as before, youâ€™ll get nothing more from
939987 [15428] me to the day of my death, and Iâ€™ll leave you nothing in my will either.â€
939987 [15429] 
939987 [15430] And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons, whom, with
939987 [15431] their wives and children, he had treated all his life as servants.
939987 [15432] Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known
939987 [15433] afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital
939987 [15434] and put business in her way.
939987 [15435] 
939987 [15436] When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a
939987 [15437] piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love
939987 [15438] with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is
939987 [15439] remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was
939987 [15440] absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have
939987 [15441] been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when
939987 [15442] Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off
939987 [15443] laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest
939987 [15444] piece of advice.
939987 [15445] 
939987 [15446] â€œIf you have to choose between the two, father or son, youâ€™d better choose
939987 [15447] the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and
939987 [15448] settle some fortune on you beforehand. But donâ€™t keep on with the captain,
939987 [15449] youâ€™ll get no good out of that.â€
939987 [15450] 
939987 [15451] These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his
939987 [15452] death was not far off and who actually died five months later.
939987 [15453] 
939987 [15454] I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the
939987 [15455] grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the
939987 [15456] object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really
939987 [15457] underlay her attitude to both of them. Even Grushenkaâ€™s two servants
939987 [15458] (after the catastrophe of which we will speak later) testified in court
939987 [15459] that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because â€œhe
939987 [15460] threatened to murder her.â€ These servants were an old cook, invalidish and
939987 [15461] almost deaf, who came from Grushenkaâ€™s old home, and her granddaughter, a
939987 [15462] smart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka
939987 [15463] lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious.
939987 [15464] Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in
939987 [15465] the fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.
939987 [15466] 
939987 [15467] It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms, yet they
939987 [15468] were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her drawing-room on the
939987 [15469] big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered with
939987 [15470] shabby and ragged leather. Under her head she had two white down pillows
939987 [15471] taken from her bed. She was lying stretched out motionless on her back
939987 [15472] with her hands behind her head. She was dressed as though expecting some
939987 [15473] one, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which
939987 [15474] was very becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with
939987 [15475] a massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She lay as
939987 [15476] though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips and eyes
939987 [15477] hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her right
939987 [15478] foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement.
939987 [15479] From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry out
939987 [15480] in a frightened voice, â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ But the maid met the visitors and at
939987 [15481] once called back to her mistress.
939987 [15482] 
939987 [15483] â€œItâ€™s not he, itâ€™s nothing, only other visitors.â€
939987 [15484] 
939987 [15485] â€œWhat can be the matter?â€ muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into the
939987 [15486] drawing-room.
939987 [15487] 
939987 [15488] Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A thick coil
939987 [15489] of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on her
939987 [15490] right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put it back till she
939987 [15491] had gazed at her visitors and recognized them.
939987 [15492] 
939987 [15493] â€œAh, itâ€™s you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?
939987 [15494] Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!â€ she exclaimed,
939987 [15495] recognizing Alyosha.
939987 [15496] 
939987 [15497] â€œDo send for candles!â€ said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air of a most
939987 [15498] intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.
939987 [15499] 
939987 [15500] â€œCandles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle.... Well,
939987 [15501] you have chosen a moment to bring him!â€ she exclaimed again, nodding
939987 [15502] towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began quickly
939987 [15503] fastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed displeased.
939987 [15504] 
939987 [15505] â€œHavenâ€™t I managed to please you?â€ asked Rakitin, instantly almost
939987 [15506] offended.
939987 [15507] 
939987 [15508] â€œYou frightened me, Rakitin, thatâ€™s what it is.â€ Grushenka turned with a
939987 [15509] smile to Alyosha. â€œDonâ€™t be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot
939987 [15510] think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor. But you frightened
939987 [15511] me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I deceived him
939987 [15512] just now, I made him promise to believe me and I told him a lie. I told
939987 [15513] him that I was going to spend the evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch,
939987 [15514] and should be there till late counting up his money. I always spend one
939987 [15515] whole evening a week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in
939987 [15516] and he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in
939987 [15517] the book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there,
939987 [15518] but I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some news.
939987 [15519] How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open it
939987 [15520] and look about whether the captain is to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and
939987 [15521] spying, I am dreadfully frightened.â€
939987 [15522] 
939987 [15523] â€œThereâ€™s no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, Iâ€™ve just looked out, I keep
939987 [15524] running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling myself.â€
939987 [15525] 
939987 [15526] â€œAre the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtainsâ€”thatâ€™s
939987 [15527] better!â€ She drew the heavy curtains herself. â€œHeâ€™d rush in at once if he
939987 [15528] saw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha.â€
939987 [15529] 
939987 [15530] Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed very happy
939987 [15531] about something.
939987 [15532] 
939987 [15533] â€œWhy are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?â€ inquired Rakitin. â€œI should have
939987 [15534] thought you were not timid with him, youâ€™d twist him round your little
939987 [15535] finger.â€
939987 [15536] 
939987 [15537] â€œI tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I donâ€™t want Mitya at
939987 [15538] all. And he didnâ€™t believe, I feel he didnâ€™t, that I should stay at Kuzma
939987 [15539] Kuzmitchâ€™s. He must be in his ambush now, behind Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s, in
939987 [15540] the garden, watching for me. And if heâ€™s there, he wonâ€™t come here, so
939987 [15541] much the better! But I really have been to Kuzma Kuzmitchâ€™s, Mitya
939987 [15542] escorted me there. I told him I should stay there till midnight, and I
939987 [15543] asked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home. He went away
939987 [15544] and I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I
939987 [15545] was afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.â€
939987 [15546] 
939987 [15547] â€œAnd why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap youâ€™ve got on!â€
939987 [15548] 
939987 [15549] â€œHow curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting a
939987 [15550] message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and you
939987 [15551] will see no more of me. Thatâ€™s why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.â€
939987 [15552] 
939987 [15553] â€œAnd where are you flying to?â€
939987 [15554] 
939987 [15555] â€œIf you know too much, youâ€™ll get old too soon.â€
939987 [15556] 
939987 [15557] â€œUpon my word! You are highly delighted ... Iâ€™ve never seen you like this
939987 [15558] before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.â€ Rakitin looked
939987 [15559] her up and down.
939987 [15560] 
939987 [15561] â€œMuch you know about balls.â€
939987 [15562] 
939987 [15563] â€œAnd do you know much about them?â€
939987 [15564] 
939987 [15565] â€œI have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitchâ€™s son was
939987 [15566] married and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want to be
939987 [15567] talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here. Such a
939987 [15568] visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and canâ€™t believe my eyes.
939987 [15569] Good heavens, can you have come here to see me! To tell you the truth, I
939987 [15570] never had a thought of seeing you and I didnâ€™t think that you would ever
939987 [15571] come and see me. Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to
939987 [15572] see you. Sit down on the sofa, here, thatâ€™s right, my bright young moon. I
939987 [15573] really canâ€™t take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had brought
939987 [15574] him yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is! Perhaps itâ€™s
939987 [15575] better he has come now, at such a moment, and not the day before
939987 [15576] yesterday.â€
939987 [15577] 
939987 [15578] She gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him with
939987 [15579] positive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying when she said
939987 [15580] so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a good-hearted merry
939987 [15581] laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in her
939987 [15582] face.... He had hardly met her till the day before, he had formed an
939987 [15583] alarming idea of her, and had been horribly distressed the day before by
939987 [15584] the spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He
939987 [15585] was greatly surprised to find her now altogether different from what he
939987 [15586] had expected. And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes
939987 [15587] involuntarily rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed
939987 [15588] changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace of
939987 [15589] that mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness in her
939987 [15590] movements. Everything was simple and good-natured, her gestures were
939987 [15591] rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.
939987 [15592] 
939987 [15593] â€œDear me, how everything comes together to-day!â€ she chattered on again.
939987 [15594] â€œAnd why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldnâ€™t say myself! If you
939987 [15595] ask me, I couldnâ€™t tell you.â€
939987 [15596] 
939987 [15597] â€œCome, donâ€™t you know why youâ€™re glad?â€ said Rakitin, grinning. â€œYou used
939987 [15598] to be always pestering me to bring him, youâ€™d some object, I suppose.â€
939987 [15599] 
939987 [15600] â€œI had a different object once, but now thatâ€™s over, this is not the
939987 [15601] moment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-natured
939987 [15602] now. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing? Youâ€™ve sat down
939987 [15603] already? Thereâ€™s no fear of Rakitinâ€™s forgetting to look after himself.
939987 [15604] Look, Alyosha, heâ€™s sitting there opposite us, so offended that I didnâ€™t
939987 [15605] ask him to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to take
939987 [15606] offense!â€ laughed Grushenka. â€œDonâ€™t be angry, Rakitin, Iâ€™m kind to-day.
939987 [15607] Why are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped into
939987 [15608] his eyes with merry mockeryâ€
939987 [15609] 
939987 [15610] â€œHeâ€™s sad. The promotion has not been given,â€ boomed Rakitin.
939987 [15611] 
939987 [15612] â€œWhat promotion?â€
939987 [15613] 
939987 [15614] â€œHis elder stinks.â€
939987 [15615] 
939987 [15616] â€œWhat? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something nasty. Be
939987 [15617] quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this.â€ She
939987 [15618] suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his knee, like a
939987 [15619] nestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck. â€œIâ€™ll cheer you up, my
939987 [15620] pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee? You wonâ€™t be
939987 [15621] angry? If you tell me, Iâ€™ll get off?â€
939987 [15622] 
939987 [15623] Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words, â€œIf you
939987 [15624] tell me, Iâ€™ll get off,â€ but he did not answer. But there was nothing in
939987 [15625] his heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly from his
939987 [15626] corner, might have expected or fancied. The great grief in his heart
939987 [15627] swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused, and, if only he
939987 [15628] could have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he
939987 [15629] had now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation.
939987 [15630] Yet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and
939987 [15631] the sorrow that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new and
939987 [15632] strange sensation in his heart. This woman, this â€œdreadfulâ€ woman, had no
939987 [15633] terror for him now, none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at
939987 [15634] any passing thought of woman. On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above
939987 [15635] all women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in
939987 [15636] him now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the
939987 [15637] intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his former
939987 [15638] terror. That was what instinctively surprised him.
939987 [15639] 
939987 [15640] â€œYouâ€™ve talked nonsense enough,â€ cried Rakitin, â€œyouâ€™d much better give us
939987 [15641] some champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!â€
939987 [15642] 
939987 [15643] â€œYes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on the
939987 [15644] top of everything, if heâ€™d bring you? Iâ€™ll have some too! Fenya, Fenya,
939987 [15645] bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so stingy, Iâ€™ll
939987 [15646] stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, youâ€™re a toadstool, but he is a
939987 [15647] falcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it,
939987 [15648] Iâ€™ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.â€
939987 [15649] 
939987 [15650] â€œBut what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, or
939987 [15651] is it a secret?â€ Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretend
939987 [15652] not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him.
939987 [15653] 
939987 [15654] â€œEch, itâ€™s not a secret, and you know it, too,â€ Grushenka said, in a voice
939987 [15655] suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a little
939987 [15656] away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his
939987 [15657] neck. â€œMy officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.â€
939987 [15658] 
939987 [15659] â€œI heard he was coming, but is he so near?â€
939987 [15660] 
939987 [15661] â€œHe is at Mokroe now; heâ€™ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I
939987 [15662] got a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger every minute.â€
939987 [15663] 
939987 [15664] â€œYou donâ€™t say so! Why at Mokroe?â€
939987 [15665] 
939987 [15666] â€œThatâ€™s a long story, Iâ€™ve told you enough.â€
939987 [15667] 
939987 [15668] â€œMityaâ€™ll be up to something nowâ€”I say! Does he know or doesnâ€™t he?â€
939987 [15669] 
939987 [15670] â€œHe know! Of course he doesnâ€™t. If he knew, there would be murder. But I
939987 [15671] am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet,
939987 [15672] Rakitin, donâ€™t remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my heart.
939987 [15673] And I donâ€™t want to think of that at this moment. I can think of Alyosha
939987 [15674] here, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my
939987 [15675] foolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, heâ€™s smiling, heâ€™s smiling! How kindly
939987 [15676] he looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, Iâ€™ve been thinking all this time
939987 [15677] you were angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of
939987 [15678] that young lady. I was a cur, thatâ€™s the truth.... But itâ€™s a good thing
939987 [15679] it happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.â€ Grushenka
939987 [15680] smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile. â€œMitya told
939987 [15681] me that she screamed out that I â€˜ought to be flogged.â€™ I did insult her
939987 [15682] dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a conquest of me, to win
939987 [15683] me over with her chocolate.... No, itâ€™s a good thing it did end like
939987 [15684] that.â€ She smiled again. â€œBut I am still afraid of your being angry.â€
939987 [15685] 
939987 [15686] â€œYes, thatâ€™s really true,â€ Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise.
939987 [15687] â€œAlyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.â€
939987 [15688] 
939987 [15689] â€œHe is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because youâ€™ve no conscience, thatâ€™s
939987 [15690] what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, thatâ€™s how it is!
939987 [15691] Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?â€
939987 [15692] 
939987 [15693] â€œAh, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!â€
939987 [15694] 
939987 [15695] â€œWell, what of it, I love him!â€
939987 [15696] 
939987 [15697] â€œAnd what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?â€
939987 [15698] 
939987 [15699] â€œThat is quite different.â€
939987 [15700] 
939987 [15701] â€œThatâ€™s a womanâ€™s way of looking at it!â€
939987 [15702] 
939987 [15703] â€œDonâ€™t you make me angry, Rakitin.â€ Grushenka caught him up hotly. â€œThis
939987 [15704] is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. Itâ€™s true, Alyosha,
939987 [15705] I had sly designs on you before. For I am a horrid, violent creature. But
939987 [15706] at other times Iâ€™ve looked upon you, Alyosha, as my conscience. Iâ€™ve kept
939987 [15707] thinking â€˜how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me.â€™ I
939987 [15708] thought that the day before yesterday, as I ran home from the young
939987 [15709] ladyâ€™s. I have thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya
939987 [15710] knows, Iâ€™ve talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe
939987 [15711] it, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of
939987 [15712] myself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that,
939987 [15713] I canâ€™t say, I donâ€™t remember....â€
939987 [15714] 
939987 [15715] Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of
939987 [15716] champagne on the table.
939987 [15717] 
939987 [15718] â€œHereâ€™s the champagne!â€ cried Rakitin. â€œYouâ€™re excited, Agrafena
939987 [15719] Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When youâ€™ve had a glass of champagne,
939987 [15720] youâ€™ll be ready to dance. Eh, they canâ€™t even do that properly,â€ he added,
939987 [15721] looking at the bottle. â€œThe old womanâ€™s poured it out in the kitchen and
939987 [15722] the bottleâ€™s been brought in warm and without a cork. Well, let me have
939987 [15723] some, anyway.â€
939987 [15724] 
939987 [15725] He went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and poured
939987 [15726] himself out another.
939987 [15727] 
939987 [15728] â€œOne doesnâ€™t often stumble upon champagne,â€ he said, licking his lips.
939987 [15729] â€œNow, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do! What shall we drink to?
939987 [15730] The gates of paradise? Take a glass, Grushenka, you drink to the gates of
939987 [15731] paradise, too.â€
939987 [15732] 
939987 [15733] â€œWhat gates of paradise?â€
939987 [15734] 
939987 [15735] She took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.
939987 [15736] 
939987 [15737] â€œNo, Iâ€™d better not,â€ he smiled gently.
939987 [15738] 
939987 [15739] â€œAnd you bragged!â€ cried Rakitin.
939987 [15740] 
939987 [15741] â€œWell, if so, I wonâ€™t either,â€ chimed in Grushenka, â€œI really donâ€™t want
939987 [15742] any. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin. If Alyosha has some, I
939987 [15743] will.â€
939987 [15744] 
939987 [15745] â€œWhat touching sentimentality!â€ said Rakitin tauntingly; â€œand sheâ€™s
939987 [15746] sitting on his knee, too! Heâ€™s got something to grieve over, but whatâ€™s
939987 [15747] the matter with you? He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat
939987 [15748] sausage....â€
939987 [15749] 
939987 [15750] â€œHow so?â€
939987 [15751] 
939987 [15752] â€œHis elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.â€
939987 [15753] 
939987 [15754] â€œSo Father Zossima is dead,â€ cried Grushenka. â€œGood God, I did not know!â€
939987 [15755] She crossed herself devoutly. â€œGoodness, what have I been doing, sitting
939987 [15756] on his knee like this at such a moment!â€ She started up as though in
939987 [15757] dismay, instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa.
939987 [15758] 
939987 [15759] Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in
939987 [15760] his face.
939987 [15761] 
939987 [15762] â€œRakitin,â€ he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; â€œdonâ€™t taunt me
939987 [15763] with having rebelled against God. I donâ€™t want to feel angry with you, so
939987 [15764] you must be kinder, too, Iâ€™ve lost a treasure such as you have never had,
939987 [15765] and you cannot judge me now. You had much better look at herâ€”do you see
939987 [15766] how she has pity on me? I came here to find a wicked soulâ€”I felt drawn to
939987 [15767] evil because I was base and evil myself, and Iâ€™ve found a true sister, I
939987 [15768] have found a treasureâ€”a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....
939987 [15769] Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. Youâ€™ve raised my soul from
939987 [15770] the depths.â€
939987 [15771] 
939987 [15772] Alyoshaâ€™s lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
939987 [15773] 
939987 [15774] â€œShe has saved you, it seems,â€ laughed Rakitin spitefully. â€œAnd she meant
939987 [15775] to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?â€
939987 [15776] 
939987 [15777] â€œStay, Rakitin.â€ Grushenka jumped up. â€œHush, both of you. Now Iâ€™ll tell
939987 [15778] you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad
939987 [15779] and not goodâ€”thatâ€™s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you are
939987 [15780] telling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, but
939987 [15781] now you are lying, now itâ€™s all different. And donâ€™t let me hear anything
939987 [15782] more from you, Rakitin.â€
939987 [15783] 
939987 [15784] All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
939987 [15785] 
939987 [15786] â€œThey are both crazy,â€ said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. â€œI
939987 [15787] feel as though I were in a madhouse. Theyâ€™re both getting so feeble
939987 [15788] theyâ€™ll begin crying in a minute.â€
939987 [15789] 
939987 [15790] â€œI shall begin to cry, I shall,â€ repeated Grushenka. â€œHe called me his
939987 [15791] sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin,
939987 [15792] though I am bad, I did give away an onion.â€
939987 [15793] 
939987 [15794] â€œAn onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.â€
939987 [15795] 
939987 [15796] Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed, though
939987 [15797] he might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a
939987 [15798] spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime. But though
939987 [15799] Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he was
939987 [15800] very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of othersâ€”partly from
939987 [15801] his youth and inexperience, partly from his intense egoism.
939987 [15802] 
939987 [15803] â€œYou see, Alyosha,â€ Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh. â€œI was
939987 [15804] boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but itâ€™s not to
939987 [15805] boast I tell you about it. Itâ€™s only a story, but itâ€™s a nice story. I
939987 [15806] used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who is still
939987 [15807] with me. Itâ€™s like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a
939987 [15808] very wicked woman she was. And she died and did not leave a single good
939987 [15809] deed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire.
939987 [15810] So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could
939987 [15811] remember to tell to God; â€˜She once pulled up an onion in her garden,â€™ said
939987 [15812] he, â€˜and gave it to a beggar woman.â€™ And God answered: â€˜You take that
939987 [15813] onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold and be
939987 [15814] pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to
939987 [15815] Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.â€™
939987 [15816] The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. â€˜Come,â€™ said he,
939987 [15817] â€˜catch hold and Iâ€™ll pull you out.â€™ And he began cautiously pulling her
939987 [15818] out. He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the lake,
939987 [15819] seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be
939987 [15820] pulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking
939987 [15821] them. â€˜Iâ€™m to be pulled out, not you. Itâ€™s my onion, not yours.â€™ As soon
939987 [15822] as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and
939987 [15823] she is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away. So
939987 [15824] thatâ€™s the story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman
939987 [15825] myself. I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you
939987 [15826] Iâ€™ll say: â€˜Iâ€™ve done nothing but give away one onion all my life, thatâ€™s
939987 [15827] the only good deed Iâ€™ve done.â€™ So donâ€™t praise me, Alyosha, donâ€™t think me
939987 [15828] good, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise
939987 [15829] me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was so anxious to
939987 [15830] get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he would
939987 [15831] bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!â€
939987 [15832] 
939987 [15833] She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out a
939987 [15834] purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
939987 [15835] 
939987 [15836] â€œWhat nonsense! What nonsense!â€ cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
939987 [15837] 
939987 [15838] â€œTake it. Rakitin, I owe it you, thereâ€™s no fear of your refusing it, you
939987 [15839] asked for it yourself.â€ And she threw the note to him.
939987 [15840] 
939987 [15841] â€œLikely I should refuse it,â€ boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, but
939987 [15842] carrying off his confusion with a swagger. â€œThat will come in very handy;
939987 [15843] fools are made for wise menâ€™s profit.â€
939987 [15844] 
939987 [15845] â€œAnd now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not for
939987 [15846] your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You donâ€™t like us, so
939987 [15847] hold your tongue.â€
939987 [15848] 
939987 [15849] â€œWhat should I like you for?â€ Rakitin snarled, not concealing his
939987 [15850] ill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket and he felt
939987 [15851] ashamed at Alyoshaâ€™s seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving his payment
939987 [15852] later, without Alyoshaâ€™s knowing of it, and now, feeling ashamed, he lost
939987 [15853] his temper. Till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradict
939987 [15854] Grushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing, since he had something to
939987 [15855] get out of her. But now he, too, was angry:
939987 [15856] 
939987 [15857] â€œOne loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done for
939987 [15858] me?â€
939987 [15859] 
939987 [15860] â€œYou should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.â€
939987 [15861] 
939987 [15862] â€œHow does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a fuss
939987 [15863] about it?â€
939987 [15864] 
939987 [15865] Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with heat and
939987 [15866] there were hysterical notes in her voice.
939987 [15867] 
939987 [15868] â€œHush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And donâ€™t dare to speak to me
939987 [15869] like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and be
939987 [15870] quiet, as though you were my footman! And now, Alyosha, Iâ€™ll tell you the
939987 [15871] whole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talking to
939987 [15872] Rakitin, but to you. I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, thatâ€™s the holy truth;
939987 [15873] I quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.
939987 [15874] And why did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,
939987 [15875] you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes. And Iâ€™ve
939987 [15876] looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking every one
939987 [15877] about you. Your face haunted my heart. â€˜He despises me,â€™ I thought; â€˜he
939987 [15878] wonâ€™t even look at me.â€™ And I felt it so much at last that I wondered at
939987 [15879] myself for being so frightened of a boy. Iâ€™ll get him in my clutches and
939987 [15880] laugh at him. I was full of spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody
939987 [15881] here dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil
939987 [15882] purpose. Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was
939987 [15883] bound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has been no
939987 [15884] one else. But looking at you, I thought, Iâ€™ll get him in my clutches and
939987 [15885] laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me your
939987 [15886] sister! And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for a
939987 [15887] message from him. And do you know what that man has been to me? Five years
939987 [15888] ago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one
939987 [15889] might have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used to
939987 [15890] sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: â€˜Where is he
939987 [15891] now, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with another woman, most
939987 [15892] likely. If only I could see him, if I could meet him again, Iâ€™d pay him
939987 [15893] out, Iâ€™d pay him out!â€™ At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in
939987 [15894] the dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose
939987 [15895] and gloat over my anger. â€˜Iâ€™ll pay him out, Iâ€™ll pay him out!â€™ Thatâ€™s what
939987 [15896] I used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should
939987 [15897] really do nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps
939987 [15898] had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into
939987 [15899] helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I would
939987 [15900] get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces.
939987 [15901] And then what do you think? I began saving money, I became hard-hearted,
939987 [15902] grew stoutâ€”grew wiser, would you say? No, no one in the whole world sees
939987 [15903] it, no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did
939987 [15904] five years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all
939987 [15905] night, thinking, â€˜Iâ€™ll pay him out, Iâ€™ll pay him out!â€™ Do you hear? Well
939987 [15906] then, now you understand me. A month ago a letter came to meâ€”he was
939987 [15907] coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath away;
939987 [15908] then I suddenly thought: â€˜If he comes and whistles to call me, I shall
939987 [15909] creep back to him like a beaten dog.â€™ I couldnâ€™t believe myself. Am I so
939987 [15910] abject? Shall I run to him or not? And Iâ€™ve been in such a rage with
939987 [15911] myself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago. Do you
939987 [15912] see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shown
939987 [15913] you the whole truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that
939987 [15914] other. Hush, Rakitin, itâ€™s not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to
939987 [15915] you. Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my
939987 [15916] whole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,
939987 [15917] Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened
939987 [15918] the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I am
939987 [15919] going through now, and no one ever can know.... For perhaps I shall take a
939987 [15920] knife with me to-day, I canâ€™t make up my mind ...â€
939987 [15921] 
939987 [15922] And at this â€œtragicâ€ phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face in her
939987 [15923] hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little child.
939987 [15924] 
939987 [15925] Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
939987 [15926] 
939987 [15927] â€œMisha,â€ he said, â€œdonâ€™t be angry. She wounded you, but donâ€™t be angry.
939987 [15928] You heard what she said just now? You mustnâ€™t ask too much of human
939987 [15929] endurance, one must be merciful.â€
939987 [15930] 
939987 [15931] Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He felt
939987 [15932] obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there,
939987 [15933] he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him ironically and
939987 [15934] Alyosha stopped short.
939987 [15935] 
939987 [15936] â€œYou were so primed up with your elderâ€™s teaching last night that now you
939987 [15937] have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!â€ said Rakitin, with a smile
939987 [15938] of hatred.
939987 [15939] 
939987 [15940] â€œDonâ€™t laugh, Rakitin, donâ€™t smile, donâ€™t talk of the deadâ€”he was better
939987 [15941] than any one in the world!â€ cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. â€œI
939987 [15942] didnâ€™t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am I
939987 [15943] beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, â€˜What does it
939987 [15944] matter?â€™ in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soon
939987 [15945] as any one says a word from the heart to herâ€”it makes her forget
939987 [15946] everything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged her
939987 [15947] has come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, and
939987 [15948] hastens joyfully to meet him and she wonâ€™t take a knife with her. She
939987 [15949] wonâ€™t! No, I am not like that. I donâ€™t know whether you are, Misha, but I
939987 [15950] am not like that. Itâ€™s a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....
939987 [15951] Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us? No, you
939987 [15952] havenâ€™t; if you had, youâ€™d have understood her long ago ... and the person
939987 [15953] insulted the day before yesterday must forgive her, too! She will, when
939987 [15954] she knows ... and she shall know.... This soul is not yet at peace with
939987 [15955] itself, one must be tender with it ... there may be a treasure in that
939987 [15956] soul....â€
939987 [15957] 
939987 [15958] Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his ill-humor
939987 [15959] Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never expected such a
939987 [15960] tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
939987 [15961] 
939987 [15962] â€œSheâ€™s found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love with her?
939987 [15963] Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monkâ€™s really in love with you, youâ€™ve made a
939987 [15964] conquest!â€ he cried, with a coarse laugh.
939987 [15965] 
939987 [15966] Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with a
939987 [15967] tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.
939987 [15968] 
939987 [15969] â€œLet him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not a person
939987 [15970] for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,â€ she turned to Rakitin, â€œI meant
939987 [15971] to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now I donâ€™t want to.
939987 [15972] Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.â€ She beckoned to him with a happy
939987 [15973] smile. â€œThatâ€™s right, sit here. Tell me,â€ she shook him by the hand and
939987 [15974] peeped into his face, smiling, â€œtell me, do I love that man or not? the
939987 [15975] man who wronged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in
939987 [15976] the dark, asking my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the
939987 [15977] time has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?â€
939987 [15978] 
939987 [15979] â€œBut you have forgiven him already,â€ said Alyosha, smiling.
939987 [15980] 
939987 [15981] â€œYes, I really have forgiven him,â€ Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. â€œWhat
939987 [15982] an abject heart! To my abject heart!â€ She snatched up a glass from the
939987 [15983] table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it on the
939987 [15984] floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came into her
939987 [15985] smile.
939987 [15986] 
939987 [15987] â€œPerhaps I havenâ€™t forgiven him, though,â€ she said, with a sort of menace
939987 [15988] in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though she were
939987 [15989] talking to herself. â€œPerhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive. I
939987 [15990] shall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, Iâ€™ve grown to love my
939987 [15991] tears in these five years.... Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him
939987 [15992] ...â€
939987 [15993] 
939987 [15994] â€œWell, I shouldnâ€™t care to be in his shoes,â€ hissed Rakitin.
939987 [15995] 
939987 [15996] â€œWell, you wonâ€™t be, Rakitin, youâ€™ll never be in his shoes. You shall
939987 [15997] black my shoes, Rakitin, thatâ€™s the place you are fit for. Youâ€™ll never
939987 [15998] get a woman like me ... and he wonâ€™t either, perhaps ...â€
939987 [15999] 
939987 [16000] â€œWonâ€™t he? Then why are you dressed up like that?â€ said Rakitin, with a
939987 [16001] venomous sneer.
939987 [16002] 
939987 [16003] â€œDonâ€™t taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you donâ€™t know all that is in
939987 [16004] my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, Iâ€™ll tear it off at once,
939987 [16005] this minute,â€ she cried in a resonant voice. â€œYou donâ€™t know what that
939987 [16006] finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and say: â€˜Have you ever
939987 [16007] seen me look like this before?â€™ He left me a thin, consumptive cry-baby of
939987 [16008] seventeen. Iâ€™ll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up. â€˜Do you see
939987 [16009] what I am like now?â€™ Iâ€™ll say to him; â€˜well, and thatâ€™s enough for you, my
939987 [16010] dear sir, thereâ€™s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip!â€™ That may be what
939987 [16011] the finery is for, Rakitin.â€ Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.
939987 [16012] â€œIâ€™m violent and resentful, Alyosha, Iâ€™ll tear off my finery, Iâ€™ll destroy
939987 [16013] my beauty, Iâ€™ll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn beggar. If
939987 [16014] I choose, I wonâ€™t go anywhere now to see any one. If I choose, Iâ€™ll send
939987 [16015] Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow, and all his money and Iâ€™ll
939987 [16016] go out charing for the rest of my life. You think I wouldnâ€™t do it,
939987 [16017] Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it? I would, I would, I could do it
939987 [16018] directly, only donâ€™t exasperate me ... and Iâ€™ll send him about his
939987 [16019] business, Iâ€™ll snap my fingers in his face, he shall never see me again!â€
939987 [16020] 
939987 [16021] She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down again,
939987 [16022] hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs.
939987 [16023] 
939987 [16024] Rakitin got up.
939987 [16025] 
939987 [16026] â€œItâ€™s time we were off,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™s late, we shall be shut out of the
939987 [16027] monastery.â€
939987 [16028] 
939987 [16029] Grushenka leapt up from her place.
939987 [16030] 
939987 [16031] â€œSurely you donâ€™t want to go, Alyosha!â€ she cried, in mournful surprise.
939987 [16032] â€œWhat are you doing to me? Youâ€™ve stirred up my feeling, tortured me, and
939987 [16033] now youâ€™ll leave me to face this night alone!â€
939987 [16034] 
939987 [16035] â€œHe can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to, let him!
939987 [16036] Iâ€™ll go alone,â€ Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
939987 [16037] 
939987 [16038] â€œHush, evil tongue!â€ Grushenka cried angrily at him; â€œyou never said such
939987 [16039] words to me as he has come to say.â€
939987 [16040] 
939987 [16041] â€œWhat has he said to you so special?â€ asked Rakitin irritably.
939987 [16042] 
939987 [16043] â€œI canâ€™t say, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know what he said to me, it went
939987 [16044] straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the first, the only
939987 [16045] one who has pitied me, thatâ€™s what it is. Why did you not come before, you
939987 [16046] angel?â€ She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy.
939987 [16047] â€œIâ€™ve been waiting all my life for some one like you, I knew that some one
939987 [16048] like you would come and forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some
939987 [16049] one would really love me, not only with a shameful love!â€
939987 [16050] 
939987 [16051] â€œWhat have I done to you?â€ answered Alyosha, bending over her with a
939987 [16052] tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; â€œI only gave you an
939987 [16053] onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!â€
939987 [16054] 
939987 [16055] He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment there was a
939987 [16056] sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall. Grushenka jumped
939987 [16057] up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily into the room, crying out:
939987 [16058] 
939987 [16059] â€œMistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,â€ she cried,
939987 [16060] breathless and joyful. â€œA carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey the
939987 [16061] driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses.... A
939987 [16062] letter, hereâ€™s the letter, mistress.â€
939987 [16063] 
939987 [16064] A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while she
939987 [16065] talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the
939987 [16066] candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.
939987 [16067] 
939987 [16068] â€œHe has sent for me,â€ she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan
939987 [16069] smile; â€œhe whistles! Crawl back, little dog!â€
939987 [16070] 
939987 [16071] But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the
939987 [16072] blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.
939987 [16073] 
939987 [16074] â€œI will go,â€ she cried; â€œfive years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha,
939987 [16075] my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, donâ€™t let me see you
939987 [16076] again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Donâ€™t you remember evil
939987 [16077] against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as
939987 [16078] though I were drunk!â€
939987 [16079] 
939987 [16080] She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.
939987 [16081] 
939987 [16082] â€œWell, she has no thoughts for us now!â€ grumbled Rakitin. â€œLetâ€™s go, or we
939987 [16083] may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and
939987 [16084] cries.â€
939987 [16085] 
939987 [16086] Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a covered
939987 [16087] cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and
939987 [16088] fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate.
939987 [16089] But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [16090] bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after
939987 [16091] Alyosha:
939987 [16092] 
939987 [16093] â€œAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to
939987 [16094] remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him,
939987 [16095] too, in my words: â€˜Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you,
939987 [16096] noble heart.â€™ And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only
939987 [16097] one short hour she loved himâ€”so let him remember that hour all his
939987 [16098] lifeâ€”say, â€˜Grushenka tells you to!â€™ â€
939987 [16099] 
939987 [16100] She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam.
939987 [16101] 
939987 [16102] â€œHâ€™m, hâ€™m!â€ growled Rakitin, laughing, â€œshe murders your brother Mitya and
939987 [16103] then tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!â€
939987 [16104] 
939987 [16105] Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast beside
939987 [16106] Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought and moved
939987 [16107] mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touched
939987 [16108] on an open wound. He had expected something quite different by bringing
939987 [16109] Grushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he had
939987 [16110] hoped for had happened.
939987 [16111] 
939987 [16112] â€œHe is a Pole, that officer of hers,â€ he began again, restraining himself;
939987 [16113] â€œand indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the customs in
939987 [16114] Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of a
939987 [16115] Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. Heâ€™s heard now that Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [16116] saved a little money, so heâ€™s turned up againâ€”thatâ€™s the explanation of
939987 [16117] the mystery.â€
939987 [16118] 
939987 [16119] Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself.
939987 [16120] 
939987 [16121] â€œWell, so youâ€™ve saved the sinner?â€ he laughed spitefully. â€œHave you
939987 [16122] turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh?
939987 [16123] So you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to
939987 [16124] pass!â€
939987 [16125] 
939987 [16126] â€œHush, Rakitin,â€ Alyosha answered with an aching heart.
939987 [16127] 
939987 [16128] â€œSo you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? Iâ€™ve sold my friend,
939987 [16129] you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas.â€
939987 [16130] 
939987 [16131] â€œOh, Rakitin, I assure you Iâ€™d forgotten about it,â€ cried Alyosha, â€œyou
939987 [16132] remind me of it yourself....â€
939987 [16133] 
939987 [16134] But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
939987 [16135] 
939987 [16136] â€œDamnation take you all and each of you!â€ he cried suddenly, â€œwhy the
939987 [16137] devil did I take you up? I donâ€™t want to know you from this time forward.
939987 [16138] Go alone, thereâ€™s your road!â€
939987 [16139] 
939987 [16140] And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the
939987 [16141] dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to the
939987 [16142] monastery.
939987 [16143] 
939987 [16144] 
939987 [16145] 
939987 [16146] Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee
939987 [16147] 
939987 [16148] 
939987 [16149] It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returned
939987 [16150] to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a special entrance. It had
939987 [16151] struck nine oâ€™clockâ€”the hour of rest and repose after a day of such
939987 [16152] agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into the
939987 [16153] elderâ€™s cell where his coffin was now standing. There was no one in the
939987 [16154] cell but Father PaÃ¯ssy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin,
939987 [16155] and the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous nightâ€™s
939987 [16156] conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the
939987 [16157] deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father
939987 [16158] PaÃ¯ssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.
939987 [16159] Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his knees
939987 [16160] and began to pray.
939987 [16161] 
939987 [16162] His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation
939987 [16163] stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow,
939987 [16164] continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange to
939987 [16165] say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw that coffin before him,
939987 [16166] the hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping and poignant
939987 [16167] grief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came
939987 [16168] in, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy
939987 [16169] was glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell was
939987 [16170] open, the air was fresh and cool. â€œSo the smell must have become stronger,
939987 [16171] if they opened the window,â€ thought Alyosha. But even this thought of the
939987 [16172] smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a
939987 [16173] few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He began
939987 [16174] quietly praying, but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically.
939987 [16175] Fragments of thought floated through his soul, flashed like stars and went
939987 [16176] out again at once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning
939987 [16177] in his soul a sense of the wholeness of thingsâ€”something steadfast and
939987 [16178] comfortingâ€”and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying
939987 [16179] ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....
939987 [16180] 
939987 [16181] But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, and
939987 [16182] sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it.
939987 [16183] He began listening to what Father PaÃ¯ssy was reading, but worn out with
939987 [16184] exhaustion he gradually began to doze.
939987 [16185] 
939987 [16186] â€œ_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_â€ read Father
939987 [16187] PaÃ¯ssy. â€œ_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called,
939987 [16188] and his disciples, to the marriage._â€
939987 [16189] 
939987 [16190] â€œMarriage? Whatâ€™s that?... A marriage!â€ floated whirling through Alyoshaâ€™s
939987 [16191] mind. â€œThere is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to the feast....
939987 [16192] No, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Well
939987 [16193] ... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases
939987 [16194] comfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to
939987 [16195] bear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods
939987 [16196] over his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the high
939987 [16197] road ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal, and the sun
939987 [16198] is at the end of it.... Ah!... Whatâ€™s being read?â€...
939987 [16199] 
939987 [16200] â€œ_And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have
939987 [16201] no wine_â€ ... Alyosha heard.
939987 [16202] 
939987 [16203] â€œAh, yes, I was missing that, and I didnâ€™t want to miss it, I love that
939987 [16204] passage: itâ€™s Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that miracle! Ah,
939987 [16205] that sweet miracle! It was not menâ€™s grief, but their joy Christ visited,
939987 [16206] He worked His first miracle to help menâ€™s gladness.... â€˜He who loves men
939987 [16207] loves their gladness, tooâ€™ ... He was always repeating that, it was one of
939987 [16208] his leading ideas.... â€˜Thereâ€™s no living without joy,â€™ Mitya says.... Yes,
939987 [16209] Mitya.... â€˜Everything that is true and good is always full of
939987 [16210] forgiveness,â€™ he used to say that, tooâ€ ...
939987 [16211] 
939987 [16212] â€œ_Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mine
939987 [16213] hour is not yet come._
939987 [16214] 
939987 [16215] â€œ_His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
939987 [16216] it_â€ ...
939987 [16217] 
939987 [16218] â€œDo it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people.... Of
939987 [16219] course they were poor, since they hadnâ€™t wine enough even at a wedding....
939987 [16220] The historians write that, in those days, the people living about the Lake
939987 [16221] of Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined ... and
939987 [16222] another great heart, that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had
939987 [16223] come not only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His
939987 [16224] heart was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure and
939987 [16225] unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor wedding. â€˜Mine
939987 [16226] hour is not yet come,â€™ He said, with a soft smile (He must have smiled
939987 [16227] gently to her). And, indeed, was it to make wine abundant at poor weddings
939987 [16228] He had come down to earth? And yet He went and did as she asked Him....
939987 [16229] Ah, he is reading againâ€....
939987 [16230] 
939987 [16231] â€œ_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
939987 [16232] them up to the brim._
939987 [16233] 
939987 [16234] â€œ_And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the
939987 [16235] feast. And they bare it._
939987 [16236] 
939987 [16237] â€œ_When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and
939987 [16238] knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the
939987 [16239] governor of the feast called the bridegroom,_
939987 [16240] 
939987 [16241] â€œ_And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;
939987 [16242] and when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast kept the
939987 [16243] good wine until now._â€
939987 [16244] 
939987 [16245] â€œBut whatâ€™s this, whatâ€™s this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah, yes
939987 [16246] ... Itâ€™s the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of course. Here are the
939987 [16247] guests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ...
939987 [16248] Where is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who? Again the
939987 [16249] walls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great table?
939987 [16250] What!... He here, too? But heâ€™s in the coffin ... but heâ€™s here, too. He
939987 [16251] has stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!â€...
939987 [16252] 
939987 [16253] Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man, with tiny
939987 [16254] wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There was no coffin now,
939987 [16255] and he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with them,
939987 [16256] when the visitors had gathered about him. His face was uncovered, his eyes
939987 [16257] were shining. How was this, then? He, too, had been called to the feast.
939987 [16258] He, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....
939987 [16259] 
939987 [16260] â€œYes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,â€ he heard a soft voice
939987 [16261] saying over him. â€œWhy have you hidden yourself here, out of sight? You
939987 [16262] come and join us too.â€
939987 [16263] 
939987 [16264] It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he, since he
939987 [16265] called him!
939987 [16266] 
939987 [16267] The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.
939987 [16268] 
939987 [16269] â€œWe are rejoicing,â€ the little, thin old man went on. â€œWe are drinking the
939987 [16270] new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many guests?
939987 [16271] Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of the feast,
939987 [16272] he is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a
939987 [16273] beggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only an onion
939987 [16274] eachâ€”only one little onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle
939987 [16275] one, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman an
939987 [16276] onion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!... Do you
939987 [16277] see our Sun, do you see Him?â€
939987 [16278] 
939987 [16279] â€œI am afraid ... I dare not look,â€ whispered Alyosha.
939987 [16280] 
939987 [16281] â€œDo not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His sublimity,
939987 [16282] but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto us from love and
939987 [16283] rejoices with us. He is changing the water into wine that the gladness of
939987 [16284] the guests may not be cut short. He is expecting new guests, He is calling
939987 [16285] new ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There they are bringing new
939987 [16286] wine. Do you see they are bringing the vessels....â€
939987 [16287] 
939987 [16288] Something glowed in Alyoshaâ€™s heart, something filled it till it ached,
939987 [16289] tears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out his hands,
939987 [16290] uttered a cry and waked up.
939987 [16291] 
939987 [16292] Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct reading
939987 [16293] of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. It was strange,
939987 [16294] he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was on his feet, and
939987 [16295] suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid steps he went
939987 [16296] right up to the coffin. His shoulder brushed against Father PaÃ¯ssy without
939987 [16297] his noticing it. Father PaÃ¯ssy raised his eyes for an instant from his
939987 [16298] book, but looked away again at once, seeing that something strange was
939987 [16299] happening to the boy. Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at
939987 [16300] the covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on
939987 [16301] his breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He
939987 [16302] had only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in
939987 [16303] his ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly he
939987 [16304] turned sharply and went out of the cell.
939987 [16305] 
939987 [16306] He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his soul,
939987 [16307] overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. The vault
939987 [16308] of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless
939987 [16309] above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to the
939987 [16310] horizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth. The white
939987 [16311] towers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire
939987 [16312] sky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were
939987 [16313] slumbering till morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the
939987 [16314] silence of the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of
939987 [16315] the stars....
939987 [16316] 
939987 [16317] Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He did
939987 [16318] not know why he embraced it. He could not have told why he longed so
939987 [16319] irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he kissed it weeping, sobbing
939987 [16320] and watering it with his tears, and vowed passionately to love it, to love
939987 [16321] it for ever and ever. â€œWater the earth with the tears of your joy and love
939987 [16322] those tears,â€ echoed in his soul.
939987 [16323] 
939987 [16324] What was he weeping over?
939987 [16325] 
939987 [16326] Oh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which were
939987 [16327] shining to him from the abyss of space, and â€œhe was not ashamed of that
939987 [16328] ecstasy.â€ There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of
939987 [16329] God, linking his soul to them, and it was trembling all over â€œin contact
939987 [16330] with other worlds.â€ He longed to forgive every one and for everything, and
939987 [16331] to beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all men, for all and for
939987 [16332] everything. â€œAnd others are praying for me too,â€ echoed again in his soul.
939987 [16333] But with every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that
939987 [16334] something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his
939987 [16335] soul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his
939987 [16336] mindâ€”and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had fallen on
939987 [16337] the earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion, and he knew and
939987 [16338] felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy. And never, never, all
939987 [16339] his life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.
939987 [16340] 
939987 [16341] â€œSome one visited my soul in that hour,â€ he used to say afterwards, with
939987 [16342] implicit faith in his words.
939987 [16343] 
939987 [16344] Within three days he left the monastery in accordance with the words of
939987 [16345] his elder, who had bidden him â€œsojourn in the world.â€

939987 [16354] Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov
939987 [16355] 
939987 [16356] 
939987 [16357] But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her
939987 [16358] last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knew
939987 [16359] nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a condition
939987 [16360] of feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been in
939987 [16361] such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill
939987 [16362] with brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able
939987 [16363] to find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him
939987 [16364] at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders,
939987 [16365] concealed his movements.
939987 [16366] 
939987 [16367] He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,
939987 [16368] â€œstruggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,â€ as he expressed
939987 [16369] it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash out of the
939987 [16370] town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose sight of
939987 [16371] Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in detail, and
939987 [16372] confirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only note
939987 [16373] the most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediately
939987 [16374] preceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him.
939987 [16375] 
939987 [16376] Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely and
939987 [16377] sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. The
939987 [16378] worst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To prevail
939987 [16379] upon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would yield to
939987 [16380] nothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from him
939987 [16381] altogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that
939987 [16382] she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of
939987 [16383] extraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something,
939987 [16384] and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he
939987 [16385] divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him
939987 [16386] and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing
939987 [16387] Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay
939987 [16388] between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.
939987 [16389] 
939987 [16390] Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded
939987 [16391] that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka
939987 [16392] lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary
939987 [16393] hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached
939987 [16394] this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That
939987 [16395] was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [16396] uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most
939987 [16397] to her advantage.
939987 [16398] 
939987 [16399] Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the
939987 [16400] approaching return of the â€œofficer,â€ that is, of the man who had been such
939987 [16401] a fatal influence in Grushenkaâ€™s life, and whose arrival she was expecting
939987 [16402] with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been
939987 [16403] very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had
939987 [16404] received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own
939987 [16405] lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite
939987 [16406] Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached
939987 [16407] hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.
939987 [16408] Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his
939987 [16409] own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more
939987 [16410] terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did not believe in a suitor
939987 [16411] who suddenly turned up again after five yearsâ€™ disappearance, still less
939987 [16412] in his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the â€œofficerâ€™sâ€ first letter which had
939987 [16413] been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rivalâ€™s visit was very
939987 [16414] vaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of
939987 [16415] sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the
939987 [16416] last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more
939987 [16417] definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered
939987 [16418] afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from
939987 [16419] Siberia on Grushenkaâ€™s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed
939987 [16420] later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely
939987 [16421] forgotten the officerâ€™s existence.
939987 [16422] 
939987 [16423] He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take,
939987 [16424] his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be
939987 [16425] decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every
939987 [16426] moment Grushenkaâ€™s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly,
939987 [16427] on the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: â€œTake
939987 [16428] me, Iâ€™m yours for ever,â€ and it would all be over. He would seize her and
939987 [16429] bear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her
939987 [16430] away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,
939987 [16431] if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with her
939987 [16432] incognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or
939987 [16433] anywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!
939987 [16434] 
939987 [16435] Of this different, reformed and â€œvirtuousâ€ life (â€œit must, it must be
939987 [16436] virtuousâ€) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that
939987 [16437] reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his
939987 [16438] own free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in such
939987 [16439] cases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not for
939987 [16440] these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he
939987 [16441] could fly away from this accursed placeâ€”he would be altogether
939987 [16442] regenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and
939987 [16443] what he was yearning for.
939987 [16444] 
939987 [16445] But all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solution
939987 [16446] of the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful
939987 [16447] ending. Suddenly she might say to him: â€œGo away. I have just come to terms
939987 [16448] with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and donâ€™t want youâ€â€”and
939987 [16449] then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to
939987 [16450] the last hour he didnâ€™t know. That must be said to his credit. He had no
939987 [16451] definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and
939987 [16452] spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution
939987 [16453] of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending
939987 [16454] a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and
939987 [16455] insoluble difficulty presented itself.
939987 [16456] 
939987 [16457] If she were to say to him: â€œIâ€™m yours; take me away,â€ how could he take
939987 [16458] her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at this
939987 [16459] time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had
939987 [16460] gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had
939987 [16461] money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced
939987 [16462] extraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life
939987 [16463] with her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive
939987 [16464] of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense
939987 [16465] repulsion. I wonâ€™t enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine
939987 [16466] myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may
939987 [16467] have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his
939987 [16468] conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly
939987 [16469] appropriated. â€œIâ€™ve been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a
939987 [16470] scoundrel again to the other directly,â€ was his feeling then, as he
939987 [16471] explained after: â€œand when Grushenka knows, she wonâ€™t care for such a
939987 [16472] scoundrel.â€
939987 [16473] 
939987 [16474] Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money?
939987 [16475] Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, â€œand only because
939987 [16476] I hadnâ€™t the money. Oh, the shame of it!â€
939987 [16477] 
939987 [16478] To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew,
939987 [16479] perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as
939987 [16480] it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however
939987 [16481] obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have the
939987 [16482] right_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s three
939987 [16483] thousandâ€”if not, â€œIâ€™m a common pickpocket, Iâ€™m a scoundrel, and I donâ€™t
939987 [16484] want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,â€ Mitya decided. And so he made up
939987 [16485] his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three
939987 [16486] thousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so to
939987 [16487] say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last
939987 [16488] interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the evening
939987 [16489] when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing
939987 [16490] Alyoshaâ€™s account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told
939987 [16491] him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After
939987 [16492] parting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it
939987 [16493] would be better â€œto murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to
939987 [16494] Katya. Iâ€™d rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, Iâ€™d rather
939987 [16495] go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived
939987 [16496] her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with Grushenka and
939987 [16497] begin a new life! That I canâ€™t do!â€ So Mitya decided, grinding his teeth,
939987 [16498] and he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. But
939987 [16499] meanwhile he went on struggling....
939987 [16500] 
939987 [16501] Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left for
939987 [16502] him but despairâ€”for what chance had he, with nothing in the world, to
939987 [16503] raise such a sum?â€”yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would
939987 [16504] get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of
939987 [16505] itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with
939987 [16506] people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except
939987 [16507] to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of
939987 [16508] their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most
939987 [16509] fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had
939987 [16510] parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a tangle
939987 [16511] of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wild
939987 [16512] enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the most
939987 [16513] impossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.
939987 [16514] 
939987 [16515] He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [16516] protector, and to propose a â€œschemeâ€ to him, and by means of it to obtain
939987 [16517] from him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the commercial value of
939987 [16518] his scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain how
939987 [16519] Samsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from
939987 [16520] any but the commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by
939987 [16521] sight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him.
939987 [16522] But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that
939987 [16523] the old reprobate, who was lying at deathâ€™s door, would perhaps not at all
939987 [16524] object now to Grushenkaâ€™s securing a respectable position, and marrying a
939987 [16525] man â€œto be depended upon.â€ And he believed not only that he would not
939987 [16526] object, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that
939987 [16527] he would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray
939987 [16528] word of Grushenkaâ€™s, he had gathered further that the old man would
939987 [16529] perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.
939987 [16530] 
939987 [16531] Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on
939987 [16532] such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the
939987 [16533] hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of
939987 [16534] delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenkaâ€™s past as
939987 [16535] something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and
939987 [16536] resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told
939987 [16537] him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a
939987 [16538] new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive
939987 [16539] one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov,
939987 [16540] Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in
939987 [16541] that remote past of Grushenkaâ€™s, though she had never loved him, and who
939987 [16542] was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say,
939987 [16543] non-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for
939987 [16544] it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck,
939987 [16545] whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now
939987 [16546] simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.
939987 [16547] 
939987 [16548] In any case there was much simplicity on Mityaâ€™s part in all this, for in
939987 [16549] spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It was an
939987 [16550] instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, being
939987 [16551] on the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerely
939987 [16552] repent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had no more
939987 [16553] devoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.
939987 [16554] 
939987 [16555] After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly slept
939987 [16556] all night, and at ten oâ€™clock next morning, he was at the house of
939987 [16557] Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very large and
939987 [16558] gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses. In the lower
939987 [16559] story lived Samsonovâ€™s two married sons with their families, his old
939987 [16560] sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his clerks,
939987 [16561] one of whom also had a large family. Both the lodge and the lower story
939987 [16562] were overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and
939987 [16563] would not even let the daughter live there with him, though she waited
939987 [16564] upon him, and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours,
939987 [16565] and at any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.
939987 [16566] 
939987 [16567] This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show,
939987 [16568] furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rows
939987 [16569] of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers under
939987 [16570] shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these rooms were entirely
939987 [16571] empty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remote
939987 [16572] bedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her
939987 [16573] head, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to
939987 [16574] his swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only
939987 [16575] rarely lifted from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting
939987 [16576] him led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and taciturn
939987 [16577] even with this old woman.
939987 [16578] 
939987 [16579] When he was informed of the arrival of the â€œcaptain,â€ he at once refused
939987 [16580] to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again. Samsonov
939987 [16581] questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he was drunk?
939987 [16582] Was he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that he was sober,
939987 [16583] but wouldnâ€™t go away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya,
939987 [16584] who had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him,
939987 [16585] wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: â€œOn most important business
939987 [16586] closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,â€ and sent it up to the old man.
939987 [16587] 
939987 [16588] After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the
939987 [16589] drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his
939987 [16590] younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a man over
939987 [16591] six foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven and
939987 [16592] dressed in the European style, though his father still wore a kaftan and a
939987 [16593] beard, came at once without a comment. All the family trembled before the
939987 [16594] father. The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of
939987 [16595] the â€œcaptainâ€ (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order to
939987 [16596] have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son and the
939987 [16597] servant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It may be assumed
939987 [16598] that he felt considerable curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya was
939987 [16599] awaiting him was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on
939987 [16600] the heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and
939987 [16601] three immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.
939987 [16602] 
939987 [16603] Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fate
939987 [16604] with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the opposite door,
939987 [16605] seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long, military
939987 [16606] stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat,
939987 [16607] buttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his hands, just as he
939987 [16608] had been three days before at the elderâ€™s, at the family meeting with his
939987 [16609] father and brothers. The old man waited for him, standing dignified and
939987 [16610] unbending, and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and
939987 [16611] through as he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonovâ€™s
939987 [16612] immensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick, hung
939987 [16613] down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in dignified silence,
939987 [16614] motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his sonâ€™s arm he
939987 [16615] began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so
939987 [16616] that Mitya, seeing his painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and
939987 [16617] sensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the
939987 [16618] dignified person he had ventured to disturb.
939987 [16619] 
939987 [16620] â€œWhat is it you want of me, sir?â€ said the old man, deliberately,
939987 [16621] distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.
939987 [16622] 
939987 [16623] Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at once
939987 [16624] speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive
939987 [16625] frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of
939987 [16626] ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old Samsonov
939987 [16627] probably grasped all this in an instant, though his face remained cold and
939987 [16628] immovable as a statueâ€™s.
939987 [16629] 
939987 [16630] â€œMost honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than once
939987 [16631] of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed me
939987 [16632] of my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossiping
939987 [16633] about it ... for here every oneâ€™s gossiping of what they shouldnâ€™t ... and
939987 [16634] besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your
939987 [16635] pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady
939987 [16636] for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...â€
939987 [16637] 
939987 [16638] So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will not
939987 [16639] reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of
939987 [16640] it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mitya
939987 [16641] purposely used these words instead of â€œintentionallyâ€) consulted a lawyer
939987 [16642] in the chief town of the province, â€œa distinguished lawyer, Kuzma
939987 [16643] Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. You have perhaps heard of him? A
939987 [16644] man of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ...
939987 [16645] spoke of you in the highest terms ...â€ Mitya broke down again. But these
939987 [16646] breaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled
939987 [16647] on and on.
939987 [16648] 
939987 [16649] This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting the
939987 [16650] documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to
939987 [16651] these documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste),
939987 [16652] reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village
939987 [16653] of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, from
939987 [16654] his mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... â€œbecause
939987 [16655] every door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.â€ In
939987 [16656] fact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand
939987 [16657] roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least,
939987 [16658] twenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact,
939987 [16659] â€œthirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didnâ€™t get
939987 [16660] seventeen from that heartless man!â€ So he, Mitya, had thrown the business
939987 [16661] up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here was
939987 [16662] struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift again
939987 [16663] and again took a flying leap forward), â€œso will not you, excellent and
939987 [16664] honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against that
939987 [16665] unnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?... You
939987 [16666] see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear
939987 [16667] that. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of
939987 [16668] three.â€ Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.
939987 [16669] 
939987 [16670] â€œIâ€™ll do the business with you at a notaryâ€™s, or whatever it is ... in
939987 [16671] fact, Iâ€™m ready to do anything.... Iâ€™ll hand over all the deeds ...
939987 [16672] whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at
939987 [16673] once ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that very
939987 [16674] morning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isnâ€™t a
939987 [16675] capitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ...
939987 [16676] would save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action....
939987 [16677] For I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you
939987 [16678] know well, and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it
939987 [16679] had not been as a father. And, indeed, itâ€™s a struggle of three in this
939987 [16680] business, for itâ€™s fateâ€”thatâ€™s a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy,
939987 [16681] Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as youâ€™ve dropped out long ago, itâ€™s a
939987 [16682] tug-of-war between two. Iâ€™m expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but Iâ€™m not
939987 [16683] a literary man. You see, Iâ€™m on the one side, and that monster on the
939987 [16684] other. So you must choose. Itâ€™s either I or the monster. It all lies in
939987 [16685] your handsâ€”the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse
939987 [16686] me, Iâ€™m making a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from your
939987 [16687] venerable eyes that you understand ... and if you donâ€™t understand, Iâ€™m
939987 [16688] done for ... so you see!â€
939987 [16689] 
939987 [16690] Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, â€œso you see!â€ and jumping up
939987 [16691] from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the last
939987 [16692] phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen
939987 [16693] flat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.
939987 [16694] 
939987 [16695] â€œHow strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now itâ€™s
939987 [16696] nothing but nonsense.â€ The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.
939987 [16697] All the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching
939987 [16698] him with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment in
939987 [16699] suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and
939987 [16700] chilling tone:
939987 [16701] 
939987 [16702] â€œExcuse me, we donâ€™t undertake such business.â€
939987 [16703] 
939987 [16704] Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.
939987 [16705] 
939987 [16706] â€œWhat am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?â€ he muttered, with a pale smile. â€œI
939987 [16707] suppose itâ€™s all up with meâ€”what do you think?â€
939987 [16708] 
939987 [16709] â€œExcuse me....â€
939987 [16710] 
939987 [16711] Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed a
939987 [16712] movement in the old manâ€™s face. He started.
939987 [16713] 
939987 [16714] â€œYou see, sir, business of that sortâ€™s not in our line,â€ said the old man
939987 [16715] slowly. â€œThereâ€™s the court, and the lawyersâ€”itâ€™s a perfect misery. But if
939987 [16716] you like, there is a man here you might apply to.â€
939987 [16717] 
939987 [16718] â€œGood heavens! Who is it? Youâ€™re my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,â€ faltered
939987 [16719] Mitya.
939987 [16720] 
939987 [16721] â€œHe doesnâ€™t live here, and heâ€™s not here just now. He is a peasant, he
939987 [16722] does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. Heâ€™s been haggling with
939987 [16723] Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya. They
939987 [16724] canâ€™t agree on the price, maybe youâ€™ve heard? Now heâ€™s come back again and
939987 [16725] is staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the
939987 [16726] Volovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse,
939987 [16727] asking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if
939987 [16728] you were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the
939987 [16729] offer youâ€™ve made me, he might possiblyâ€”â€
939987 [16730] 
939987 [16731] â€œA brilliant idea!â€ Mitya interrupted ecstatically. â€œHeâ€™s the very man, it
939987 [16732] would just suit him. Heâ€™s haggling with him for it, being asked too much,
939987 [16733] and here he would have all the documents entitling him to the property
939987 [16734] itself. Ha ha ha!â€
939987 [16735] 
939987 [16736] And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling
939987 [16737] Samsonov.
939987 [16738] 
939987 [16739] â€œHow can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?â€ cried Mitya effusively.
939987 [16740] 
939987 [16741] â€œDonâ€™t mention it,â€ said Samsonov, inclining his head.
939987 [16742] 
939987 [16743] â€œBut you donâ€™t know, youâ€™ve saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment
939987 [16744] brought me to you.... So now to this priest!â€
939987 [16745] 
939987 [16746] â€œNo need of thanks.â€
939987 [16747] 
939987 [16748] â€œIâ€™ll make haste and fly there. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve overtaxed your strength. I
939987 [16749] shall never forget it. Itâ€™s a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a
939987 [16750] R-r-russian!â€
939987 [16751] 
939987 [16752] â€œTo be sure!â€
939987 [16753] 
939987 [16754] Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in the
939987 [16755] old manâ€™s eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself for
939987 [16756] his mistrustfulness.
939987 [16757] 
939987 [16758] â€œItâ€™s because heâ€™s tired,â€ he thought.
939987 [16759] 
939987 [16760] â€œFor her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that itâ€™s for
939987 [16761] her,â€ he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed, turned
939987 [16762] sharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door without
939987 [16763] looking back. He was trembling with delight.
939987 [16764] 
939987 [16765] â€œEverything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,â€ was
939987 [16766] the thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a most
939987 [16767] worthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then ...
939987 [16768] then success was assured. He would fly off immediately. â€œI will be back
939987 [16769] before night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done. Could the
939987 [16770] old man have been laughing at me?â€ exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards
939987 [16771] his lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was
939987 [16772] practical â€œfrom such a business manâ€ with an understanding of the
939987 [16773] business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Orâ€”the
939987 [16774] old man was laughing at him.
939987 [16775] 
939987 [16776] Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, when
939987 [16777] the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing,
939987 [16778] that he had made a fool of the â€œcaptain.â€ He was a cold, spiteful and
939987 [16779] sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was the
939987 [16780] â€œcaptainâ€™sâ€ excited face, or the foolish conviction of the â€œrake and
939987 [16781] spendthrift,â€ that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull
939987 [16782] story as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this
939987 [16783] â€œscapegraceâ€ had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which
939987 [16784] worked on the old man, I canâ€™t tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood
939987 [16785] before him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and frantically
939987 [16786] exclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him
939987 [16787] with intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When
939987 [16788] Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his son and
939987 [16789] bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and never
939987 [16790] admitted even into the yard, or else heâ€™dâ€”
939987 [16791] 
939987 [16792] He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him enraged,
939987 [16793] trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shaking
939987 [16794] with anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the doctor.
939987 [16795] 
939987 [16796] 
939987 [16797] 
939987 [16798] Chapter II. Lyagavy
939987 [16799] 
939987 [16800] 
939987 [16801] So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. He
939987 [16802] had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many years
939987 [16803] of prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had long
939987 [16804] ceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who
939987 [16805] had a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him six roubles for it.
939987 [16806] 
939987 [16807] â€œAnd I didnâ€™t expect that,â€ cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in a
939987 [16808] state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home he
939987 [16809] borrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him so much
939987 [16810] that they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had. Mitya
939987 [16811] in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided
939987 [16812] that day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he had
939987 [16813] put before Samsonov, the latterâ€™s decision, his own hopes for the future,
939987 [16814] and so on. These people had been told many of their lodgerâ€™s secrets
939987 [16815] before, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud,
939987 [16816] and almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya
939987 [16817] sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This was how
939987 [16818] the fact came to be remembered and established that â€œat midday, on the day
939987 [16819] before the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he had sold his watch
939987 [16820] to get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord, all in the
939987 [16821] presence of witnesses.â€
939987 [16822] 
939987 [16823] I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.
939987 [16824] 
939987 [16825] Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at last
939987 [16826] solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station, he
939987 [16827] trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his absence.
939987 [16828] What if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? This was
939987 [16829] why he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with his
939987 [16830] landlady not to let out where he had gone, if any one came to inquire for
939987 [16831] him.
939987 [16832] 
939987 [16833] â€œI must, I must get back to-night,â€ he repeated, as he was jolted along in
939987 [16834] the cart, â€œand I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ...
939987 [16835] to draw up the deed.â€ So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas!
939987 [16836] his dreams were not fated to be carried out.
939987 [16837] 
939987 [16838] To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station which
939987 [16839] turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he did not
939987 [16840] find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a neighboring
939987 [16841] village. While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses,
939987 [16842] was looking for him, it was almost dark.
939987 [16843] 
939987 [16844] The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at once
939987 [16845] that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now at
939987 [16846] Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the foresterâ€™s cottage,
939987 [16847] as he was buying timber there too. At Mityaâ€™s urgent request that he would
939987 [16848] take him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing â€œsave him, so to speak,â€ the
939987 [16849] priest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his
939987 [16850] curiosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on
939987 [16851] foot, as it would not be â€œmuch overâ€ a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed,
939987 [16852] and marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost
939987 [16853] ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.
939987 [16854] 
939987 [16855] Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously and
939987 [16856] excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way. The
939987 [16857] priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off Mityaâ€™s
939987 [16858] questions with: â€œI donâ€™t know. Ah, I canâ€™t say. How can I tell?â€ and so
939987 [16859] on. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over his
939987 [16860] inheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he was in some way
939987 [16861] dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why
939987 [16862] he called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained
939987 [16863] to Mitya that, though the manâ€™s name really was Lyagavy, he was never
939987 [16864] called so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he
939987 [16865] must be sure to call him Gorstkin, â€œor youâ€™ll do nothing with him; he
939987 [16866] wonâ€™t even listen to you,â€ said the priest in conclusion.
939987 [16867] 
939987 [16868] Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was
939987 [16869] what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped the
939987 [16870] subject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubt
939987 [16871] whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy,
939987 [16872] there was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into
939987 [16873] ridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried,
939987 [16874] striding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize
939987 [16875] that they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three.
939987 [16876] This annoyed him, but he controlled himself.
939987 [16877] 
939987 [16878] They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and
939987 [16879] Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of the
939987 [16880] passage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut was
939987 [16881] extremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had gone out,
939987 [16882] a tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and
939987 [16883] some half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched
939987 [16884] at full length on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a
939987 [16885] pillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.
939987 [16886] 
939987 [16887] â€œOf course I must wake him. My business is too important. Iâ€™ve come in
939987 [16888] such haste. Iâ€™m in a hurry to get back to-day,â€ he said in great
939987 [16889] agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving
939987 [16890] their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; he
939987 [16891] tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.
939987 [16892] 
939987 [16893] â€œHeâ€™s drunk,â€ Mitya decided. â€œGood Lord! What am I to do? What am I to
939987 [16894] do?â€ And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by the
939987 [16895] legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench.
939987 [16896] Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting the
939987 [16897] drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.
939987 [16898] 
939987 [16899] â€œNo, youâ€™d better wait a little,â€ the priest pronounced at last, â€œfor heâ€™s
939987 [16900] obviously not in a fit state.â€
939987 [16901] 
939987 [16902] â€œHeâ€™s been drinking the whole day,â€ the forester chimed in.
939987 [16903] 
939987 [16904] â€œGood heavens!â€ cried Mitya. â€œIf only you knew how important it is to me
939987 [16905] and how desperate I am!â€
939987 [16906] 
939987 [16907] â€œNo, youâ€™d better wait till morning,â€ the priest repeated.
939987 [16908] 
939987 [16909] â€œTill morning? Mercy! thatâ€™s impossible!â€
939987 [16910] 
939987 [16911] And in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man
939987 [16912] again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his
939987 [16913] efforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
939987 [16914] 
939987 [16915] â€œWhat terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,â€ said Mitya, in
939987 [16916] complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The priest
939987 [16917] seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even if he
939987 [16918] succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and incapable of
939987 [16919] conversation. â€œAnd your business is important,â€ he said, â€œso youâ€™d
939987 [16920] certainly better put it off till morning.â€ With a gesture of despair Mitya
939987 [16921] agreed.
939987 [16922] 
939987 [16923] â€œFather, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. As
939987 [16924] soon as he wakes Iâ€™ll begin. Iâ€™ll pay you for the light,â€ he said to the
939987 [16925] forester, â€œfor the nightâ€™s lodging, too; youâ€™ll remember Dmitri Karamazov.
939987 [16926] Only, Father, I donâ€™t know what weâ€™re to do with you. Where will you
939987 [16927] sleep?â€
939987 [16928] 
939987 [16929] â€œNo, Iâ€™m going home. Iâ€™ll take his horse and get home,â€ he said,
939987 [16930] indicating the forester. â€œAnd now Iâ€™ll say good-by. I wish you all
939987 [16931] success.â€
939987 [16932] 
939987 [16933] So it was settled. The priest rode off on the foresterâ€™s horse, delighted
939987 [16934] to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering whether he ought
939987 [16935] not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curious
939987 [16936] incident, â€œor he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw
939987 [16937] his favor.â€
939987 [16938] 
939987 [16939] The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word,
939987 [16940] and Mitya sat on the bench to â€œcatch the favorable moment,â€ as he
939987 [16941] expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist. A
939987 [16942] profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach no
939987 [16943] conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became
939987 [16944] insufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured the
939987 [16945] garden, the path behind the garden, the door of his fatherâ€™s house
939987 [16946] mysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench.
939987 [16947] 
939987 [16948] â€œItâ€™s a tragedy!â€ he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up to
939987 [16949] the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle-aged
939987 [16950] peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish
939987 [16951] beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocket
939987 [16952] of which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his face with
939987 [16953] intense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly
939987 [16954] irritated him.
939987 [16955] 
939987 [16956] What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of such
939987 [16957] importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn out, should
939987 [16958] with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole
939987 [16959] fate depended, while he snored as though there were nothing the matter, as
939987 [16960] though heâ€™d dropped from another planet.
939987 [16961] 
939987 [16962] â€œOh, the irony of fate!â€ cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he fell
939987 [16963] again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of ferocity,
939987 [16964] pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five minutes of vain
939987 [16965] exertions, he returned to his bench in helpless despair, and sat down.
939987 [16966] 
939987 [16967] â€œStupid! Stupid!â€ cried Mitya. â€œAnd how dishonorable it all is!â€ something
939987 [16968] made him add. His head began to ache horribly. â€œShould he fling it up and
939987 [16969] go away altogether?â€ he wondered. â€œNo, wait till to-morrow now. Iâ€™ll stay
939987 [16970] on purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, Iâ€™ve no means of going. How
939987 [16971] am I to get away from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!â€
939987 [16972] 
939987 [16973] But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously
939987 [16974] dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours
939987 [16975] or more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could
939987 [16976] have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his
939987 [16977] head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and
939987 [16978] understand what had happened to him.
939987 [16979] 
939987 [16980] At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the
939987 [16981] stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still
939987 [16982] lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out,
939987 [16983] and ran staggering across the passage into the foresterâ€™s room. The
939987 [16984] forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of
939987 [16985] fumes, to Mityaâ€™s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange
939987 [16986] unconcern, though he did go to see to it.
939987 [16987] 
939987 [16988] â€œBut heâ€™s dead, heâ€™s dead! and ... what am I to do then?â€ cried Mitya
939987 [16989] frantically.
939987 [16990] 
939987 [16991] They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought
939987 [16992] a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then,
939987 [16993] finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on
939987 [16994] Lyagavyâ€™s head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and
939987 [16995] when he opened the window said grumpily:
939987 [16996] 
939987 [16997] â€œItâ€™ll be all right, now.â€
939987 [16998] 
939987 [16999] He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed about
939987 [17000] the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravely
939987 [17001] resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he sat
939987 [17002] down for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciously
939987 [17003] stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.
939987 [17004] 
939987 [17005] It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine oâ€™clock.
939987 [17006] The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. The
939987 [17007] curly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on. He had
939987 [17008] another samovar and another bottle in front of him. Yesterdayâ€™s bottle had
939987 [17009] already been finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya
939987 [17010] jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again,
939987 [17011] hopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened
939987 [17012] eyes. The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting
939987 [17013] composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya
939987 [17014] fancied. He rushed up to him.
939987 [17015] 
939987 [17016] â€œExcuse me, you see ... I ... youâ€™ve most likely heard from the forester
939987 [17017] here in the hut. Iâ€™m Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old
939987 [17018] Karamazov whose copse you are buying.â€
939987 [17019] 
939987 [17020] â€œThatâ€™s a lie!â€ said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
939987 [17021] 
939987 [17022] â€œA lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?â€
939987 [17023] 
939987 [17024] â€œI donâ€™t know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,â€ said the peasant, speaking
939987 [17025] thickly.
939987 [17026] 
939987 [17027] â€œYouâ€™re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and
939987 [17028] collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote to
939987 [17029] Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,â€ Mitya gasped breathlessly.
939987 [17030] 
939987 [17031] â€œYouâ€™re l-lying!â€ Lyagavy blurted out again. Mityaâ€™s legs went cold.
939987 [17032] 
939987 [17033] â€œFor mercyâ€™s sake! It isnâ€™t a joke! Youâ€™re drunk, perhaps. Yet you can
939987 [17034] speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!â€
939987 [17035] 
939987 [17036] â€œYouâ€™re a painter!â€
939987 [17037] 
939987 [17038] â€œFor mercyâ€™s sake! Iâ€™m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to
939987 [17039] make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning
939987 [17040] the copse!â€
939987 [17041] 
939987 [17042] The peasant stroked his beard importantly.
939987 [17043] 
939987 [17044] â€œNo, youâ€™ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. Youâ€™re a
939987 [17045] scoundrel!â€
939987 [17046] 
939987 [17047] â€œI assure you youâ€™re mistaken,â€ cried Mitya, wringing his hands in
939987 [17048] despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up his
939987 [17049] eyes cunningly.
939987 [17050] 
939987 [17051] â€œNo, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. Dâ€™you
939987 [17052] hear? Youâ€™re a scoundrel! Do you understand that?â€
939987 [17053] 
939987 [17054] Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly â€œsomething seemed to hit him on
939987 [17055] the head,â€ as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in
939987 [17056] his mind, â€œa light was kindled and I grasped it all.â€ He stood, stupefied,
939987 [17057] wondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to
939987 [17058] such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for
939987 [17059] almost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.
939987 [17060] 
939987 [17061] â€œWhy, the manâ€™s drunk, dead drunk, and heâ€™ll go on drinking now for a
939987 [17062] week; whatâ€™s the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here on
939987 [17063] purpose? What if sheâ€”? Oh, God, what have I done?â€
939987 [17064] 
939987 [17065] The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might have
939987 [17066] killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He went
939987 [17067] quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, and
939987 [17068] went out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next room; there
939987 [17069] was no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocket
939987 [17070] and put them on the table for his nightâ€™s lodging, the candle, and the
939987 [17071] trouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all
939987 [17072] round. He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut,
939987 [17073] to the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with the
939987 [17074] priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful feeling for
939987 [17075] anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode along a narrow forest
939987 [17076] path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he was going. A child could
939987 [17077] have knocked him down, so weak was he in body and soul. He got out of the
939987 [17078] forest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest,
939987 [17079] stretched as far as the eye could see.
939987 [17080] 
939987 [17081] â€œWhat despair! What death all round!â€ he repeated, striding on and on.
939987 [17082] 
939987 [17083] He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across
939987 [17084] country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and it
939987 [17085] turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After some
939987 [17086] discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. At
939987 [17087] Volovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, and
939987 [17088] suddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While the horses were
939987 [17089] being harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an
939987 [17090] instant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three
939987 [17091] glasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He
939987 [17092] flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and
939987 [17093] â€œunalterableâ€ plan to procure that â€œaccursed moneyâ€ before evening. â€œAnd
939987 [17094] to think, only to think that a manâ€™s life should be ruined for the sake of
939987 [17095] that paltry three thousand!â€ he cried, contemptuously. â€œIâ€™ll settle it
939987 [17096] to-day.â€ And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what
939987 [17097] might have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps have
939987 [17098] become quite cheerful again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to
939987 [17099] the heart every moment, like a sharp knife.
939987 [17100] 
939987 [17101] At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.
939987 [17102] 
939987 [17103] 
939987 [17104] 
939987 [17105] Chapter III. Gold-Mines
939987 [17106] 
939987 [17107] 
939987 [17108] This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with
939987 [17109] such horror. She was just then expecting the â€œmessage,â€ and was much
939987 [17110] relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before.
939987 [17111] She hoped that â€œplease God he wonâ€™t come till Iâ€™m gone away,â€ and he
939987 [17112] suddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him off her
939987 [17113] hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonovâ€™s,
939987 [17114] where she said she absolutely must go â€œto settle his accounts,â€ and when
939987 [17115] Mitya accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making
939987 [17116] him promise to come at twelve oâ€™clock to take her home again. Mitya, too,
939987 [17117] was delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting at Samsonovâ€™s she
939987 [17118] could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s, â€œif only sheâ€™s not lying,â€ he
939987 [17119] added at once. But he thought she was not lying from what he saw.
939987 [17120] 
939987 [17121] He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman,
939987 [17122] at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to
939987 [17123] her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken, heartbroken,
939987 [17124] convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at the first glance
939987 [17125] at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he revives at once,
939987 [17126] lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his
939987 [17127] jealousy.
939987 [17128] 
939987 [17129] After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much
939987 [17130] still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart, anyway.
939987 [17131] 
939987 [17132] â€œNow I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anything
939987 [17133] happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to Fyodor
939987 [17134] Pavlovitch; ough!â€ floated through his mind.
939987 [17135] 
939987 [17136] Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again in
939987 [17137] his restless heart.
939987 [17138] 
939987 [17139] Jealousy! â€œOthello was not jealous, he was trustful,â€ observed Pushkin.
939987 [17140] And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great
939987 [17141] poet. Othelloâ€™s soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply
939987 [17142] because _his ideal was destroyed_. But Othello did not begin hiding,
939987 [17143] spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up,
939987 [17144] pushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the
939987 [17145] idea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible
939987 [17146] to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous
939987 [17147] man can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet itâ€™s not as though
939987 [17148] the jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of
939987 [17149] lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet
939987 [17150] hide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the
939987 [17151] lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.
939987 [17152] 
939987 [17153] Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessnessâ€”not incapable
939987 [17154] of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to itâ€”though his soul was as
939987 [17155] innocent and free from malice as a babeâ€™s. It is not so with the really
939987 [17156] jealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their
939987 [17157] mind to and overlook, and what they can forgive! The jealous are the
939987 [17158] readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man can
939987 [17159] forgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violent
939987 [17160] scene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved,
939987 [17161] the very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be
939987 [17162] convinced that it has all been â€œfor the last time,â€ and that his rival
939987 [17163] will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth,
939987 [17164] or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that dreaded rival
939987 [17165] will not get near her. Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour.
939987 [17166] For, even if the rival did disappear next day, he would invent another one
939987 [17167] and would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a love
939987 [17168] that had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed
939987 [17169] such strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never understand. And
939987 [17170] yet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those
939987 [17171] very men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and
939987 [17172] spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though
939987 [17173] they understand clearly enough with their â€œnoble heartsâ€ the shameful
939987 [17174] depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.
939987 [17175] 
939987 [17176] At the sight of Grushenka, Mityaâ€™s jealousy vanished, and, for an instant
939987 [17177] he became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his
939987 [17178] evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, there
939987 [17179] was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that it
939987 [17180] was not only a sensual passion, not only the â€œcurve of her body,â€ of which
939987 [17181] he had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began
939987 [17182] to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no
939987 [17183] sting of conscience at it.
939987 [17184] 
939987 [17185] And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make
939987 [17186] haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small,
939987 [17187] temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his
939987 [17188] expedition. And, as we all know, one canâ€™t take a step without money. But
939987 [17189] he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace
939987 [17190] of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then
939987 [17191] because he prized them above all his possessions.
939987 [17192] 
939987 [17193] In the â€œMetropolisâ€ tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a
939987 [17194] young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was
939987 [17195] passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers,
939987 [17196] hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself on
939987 [17197] them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya,
939987 [17198] without stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his
939987 [17199] pistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to
939987 [17200] persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent, so the
939987 [17201] young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce him
939987 [17202] to take interest. They parted friends.
939987 [17203] 
939987 [17204] Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s by the back way,
939987 [17205] to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In this way
939987 [17206] the fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event,
939987 [17207] of which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for
939987 [17208] ten roubles a possession he valued, though, three hours later, he was in
939987 [17209] possession of thousands.... But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna
939987 [17210] (the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s) he learned the very disturbing
939987 [17211] fact of Smerdyakovâ€™s illness. He heard the story of his fall in the
939987 [17212] cellar, his fit, the doctorâ€™s visit, Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s anxiety; he heard
939987 [17213] with interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning for
939987 [17214] Moscow.
939987 [17215] 
939987 [17216] â€œThen he must have driven through Volovya before me,â€ thought Dmitri, but
939987 [17217] he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. â€œWhat will happen now? Whoâ€™ll
939987 [17218] keep watch for me? Whoâ€™ll bring me word?â€ he thought. He began greedily
939987 [17219] questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before.
939987 [17220] They quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completely
939987 [17221] reassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the
939987 [17222] night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He
939987 [17223] would certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at
939987 [17224] Samsonovâ€™s gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here and
939987 [17225] there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had to
939987 [17226] carry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure
939987 [17227] of its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to
939987 [17228] sacrifice an hour to it: â€œIn an hour I shall know everything, I shall
939987 [17229] settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonovâ€™s. Iâ€™ll
939987 [17230] inquire whether Grushenkaâ€™s there and instantly be back here again, stay
939987 [17231] till eleven, and then to Samsonovâ€™s again to bring her home.â€ This was
939987 [17232] what he decided.
939987 [17233] 
939987 [17234] He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, and
939987 [17235] went to Madame Hohlakovâ€™s. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He had
939987 [17236] resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he
939987 [17237] felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. It
939987 [17238] may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at
939987 [17239] first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he
939987 [17240] did not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how
939987 [17241] to speak.
939987 [17242] 
939987 [17243] But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had
939987 [17244] seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not
939987 [17245] endure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to
939987 [17246] Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the
939987 [17247] desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the
939987 [17248] â€œcharming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.â€
939987 [17249] Mityaâ€™s manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had
939987 [17250] once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was
939987 [17251] uncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck
939987 [17252] him: â€œIf she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovnaâ€ (and he
939987 [17253] knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) â€œwhy should she
939987 [17254] refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and
939987 [17255] get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their
939987 [17256] hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice.
939987 [17257] Besides, sheâ€™s so rich,â€ Mitya argued.
939987 [17258] 
939987 [17259] As for his â€œplanâ€ it was just the same as before; it consisted of the
939987 [17260] offer of his rights to Tchermashnyaâ€”but not with a commercial object, as
939987 [17261] it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the
939987 [17262] possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousandâ€”but simply as a
939987 [17263] security for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted
939987 [17264] with it, but so it always was with him in all his undertakings, in all his
939987 [17265] sudden decisions. He gave himself up to every new idea with passionate
939987 [17266] enthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakovâ€™s house he
939987 [17267] felt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as
939987 [17268] a mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke
939987 [17269] down, nothing else was left him in the world, but to â€œrob and murder some
939987 [17270] one for the three thousand.â€ It was half-past seven when he rang at the
939987 [17271] bell.
939987 [17272] 
939987 [17273] At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced he
939987 [17274] was received with extraordinary rapidity. â€œAs though she were waiting for
939987 [17275] me,â€ thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the drawing-room,
939987 [17276] the lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she was
939987 [17277] expecting him.
939987 [17278] 
939987 [17279] â€œI was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though Iâ€™d no reason to suppose
939987 [17280] you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I did expect
939987 [17281] you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was
939987 [17282] convinced all the morning that you would come.â€
939987 [17283] 
939987 [17284] â€œThat is certainly wonderful, madam,â€ observed Mitya, sitting down limply,
939987 [17285] â€œbut I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On a matter of
939987 [17286] supreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and I
939987 [17287] hastenâ€”â€
939987 [17288] 
939987 [17289] â€œI know youâ€™ve come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; itâ€™s
939987 [17290] not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculous
939987 [17291] (have you heard about Father Zossima?). This is a case of mathematics: you
939987 [17292] couldnâ€™t help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna;
939987 [17293] you couldnâ€™t, you couldnâ€™t, thatâ€™s a mathematical certainty.â€
939987 [17294] 
939987 [17295] â€œThe realism of actual life, madam, thatâ€™s what it is. But allow me to
939987 [17296] explainâ€”â€
939987 [17297] 
939987 [17298] â€œRealism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Iâ€™m all for realism now. Iâ€™ve seen
939987 [17299] too much of miracles. Youâ€™ve heard that Father Zossima is dead?â€
939987 [17300] 
939987 [17301] â€œNo, madam, itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve heard of it.â€ Mitya was a little
939987 [17302] surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.
939987 [17303] 
939987 [17304] â€œLast night, and only imagineâ€”â€
939987 [17305] 
939987 [17306] â€œMadam,â€ said Mitya, â€œI can imagine nothing except that Iâ€™m in a desperate
939987 [17307] position, and that if you donâ€™t help me, everything will come to grief,
939987 [17308] and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but
939987 [17309] Iâ€™m in a feverâ€”â€
939987 [17310] 
939987 [17311] â€œI know, I know that youâ€™re in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, and
939987 [17312] whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinking
939987 [17313] over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying
939987 [17314] it.... Oh, believe me, Iâ€™m an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri
939987 [17315] Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [17316] 
939987 [17317] â€œMadam, if you are an experienced doctor, Iâ€™m certainly an experienced
939987 [17318] patient,â€ said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, â€œand I feel that if you
939987 [17319] are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my
939987 [17320] ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I
939987 [17321] have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you.... I have
939987 [17322] come, madamâ€”â€
939987 [17323] 
939987 [17324] â€œDonâ€™t explain it. Itâ€™s of secondary importance. But as for help, youâ€™re
939987 [17325] not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likely
939987 [17326] heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, â€˜had come to
939987 [17327] grief,â€™ as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I
939987 [17328] recommended him to take to horse-breeding, and now heâ€™s doing well. Have
939987 [17329] you any idea of horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [17330] 
939987 [17331] â€œNot the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!â€ cried Mitya, in
939987 [17332] nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. â€œI simply implore
939987 [17333] you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech that
939987 [17334] I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have
939987 [17335] come. Besides, I am short of time. Iâ€™m in a fearful hurry,â€ Mitya cried
939987 [17336] hysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, and
939987 [17337] hoping to cut her short. â€œI have come in despair ... in the last gasp of
939987 [17338] despair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on
939987 [17339] safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!
939987 [17340] Only let me explainâ€”â€
939987 [17341] 
939987 [17342] â€œYou must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!â€ Madame Hohlakov with a
939987 [17343] gesture demanded silence in her turn, â€œand whatever you may tell me, I
939987 [17344] know it all beforehand; Iâ€™ve told you so already. You ask for a certain
939987 [17345] sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I
939987 [17346] will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.â€
939987 [17347] 
939987 [17348] Mitya started from his seat again.
939987 [17349] 
939987 [17350] â€œMadam, will you really be so good!â€ he cried, with strong feeling. â€œGood
939987 [17351] God, youâ€™ve saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a
939987 [17352] bullet.... My eternal gratitudeâ€”â€
939987 [17353] 
939987 [17354] â€œI will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!â€ cried Madame
939987 [17355] Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mityaâ€™s ecstasy.
939987 [17356] 
939987 [17357] â€œInfinitely? But I donâ€™t need so much. I only need that fatal three
939987 [17358] thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite
939987 [17359] gratitude, and I propose a plan whichâ€”â€
939987 [17360] 
939987 [17361] â€œEnough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, itâ€™s said and done.â€ Madame Hohlakov cut him
939987 [17362] short, with the modest triumph of beneficence: â€œI have promised to save
939987 [17363] you, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What do you
939987 [17364] think of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [17365] 
939987 [17366] â€œOf the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.â€
939987 [17367] 
939987 [17368] â€œBut I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again.
939987 [17369] I have been watching you for the last month. Iâ€™ve watched you a hundred
939987 [17370] times as youâ€™ve walked past, saying to myself: Thatâ€™s a man of energy who
939987 [17371] ought to be at the gold-mines. Iâ€™ve studied your gait and come to the
939987 [17372] conclusion: thatâ€™s a man who would find gold.â€
939987 [17373] 
939987 [17374] â€œFrom my gait, madam?â€ said Mitya, smiling.
939987 [17375] 
939987 [17376] â€œYes, from your gait. You surely donâ€™t deny that character can be told
939987 [17377] from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. Iâ€™m all for
939987 [17378] science and realism now. After all this business with Father Zossima,
939987 [17379] which has so upset me, from this very day Iâ€™m a realist and I want to
939987 [17380] devote myself to practical usefulness. Iâ€™m cured. â€˜Enough!â€™ as Turgenev
939987 [17381] says.â€
939987 [17382] 
939987 [17383] â€œBut, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend meâ€”â€
939987 [17384] 
939987 [17385] â€œIt is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. â€œThe
939987 [17386] money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million,
939987 [17387] Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. Iâ€™ll make you a present of the
939987 [17388] idea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become a
939987 [17389] leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave
939987 [17390] it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all
939987 [17391] sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of
939987 [17392] railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Youâ€™ll become famous and indispensable to
939987 [17393] the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The
939987 [17394] depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;
939987 [17395] people donâ€™t know that side of meâ€”â€
939987 [17396] 
939987 [17397] â€œMadam, madam!â€ Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. â€œI shall
939987 [17398] indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall
939987 [17399] perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines.... Iâ€™ll come and see you again
939987 [17400] about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so
939987 [17401] generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... you
939987 [17402] see, I havenâ€™t a minute, a minute to lose to-dayâ€”â€
939987 [17403] 
939987 [17404] â€œEnough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!â€ Madame Hohlakov interrupted
939987 [17405] emphatically. â€œThe question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; have
939987 [17406] you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.â€
939987 [17407] 
939987 [17408] â€œI will go, madam, afterwards.... Iâ€™ll go where you like ... but nowâ€”â€
939987 [17409] 
939987 [17410] â€œWait!â€ cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsome
939987 [17411] bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer
939987 [17412] after another, looking for something with desperate haste.
939987 [17413] 
939987 [17414] â€œThe three thousand,â€ thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, â€œand at
939987 [17415] the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... thatâ€™s doing things
939987 [17416] in gentlemanly style! Sheâ€™s a splendid woman, if only she didnâ€™t talk so
939987 [17417] much!â€
939987 [17418] 
939987 [17419] â€œHere!â€ cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, â€œhere is
939987 [17420] what I was looking for!â€
939987 [17421] 
939987 [17422] It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the
939987 [17423] skin with a cross.
939987 [17424] 
939987 [17425] â€œThis is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ she went on reverently, â€œfrom
939987 [17426] the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck myself,
939987 [17427] and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.â€
939987 [17428] 
939987 [17429] And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it. In
939987 [17430] extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last he got
939987 [17431] it under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.
939987 [17432] 
939987 [17433] â€œNow you can set off,â€ Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down
939987 [17434] triumphantly in her place again.
939987 [17435] 
939987 [17436] â€œMadam, I am so touched. I donâ€™t know how to thank you, indeed ... for
939987 [17437] such kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....
939987 [17438] That sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity....
939987 [17439] Oh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,â€ Mitya
939987 [17440] exclaimed impulsively, â€œthen let me reveal to you ... though, of course,
939987 [17441] youâ€™ve known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been
939987 [17442] false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, Iâ€™ve behaved
939987 [17443] inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another woman
939987 [17444] ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything
939987 [17445] already, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three
939987 [17446] thousand nowâ€”â€
939987 [17447] 
939987 [17448] â€œLeave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ Madame Hohlakov interrupted in
939987 [17449] the most decisive tone. â€œLeave everything, especially women. Gold-mines
939987 [17450] are your goal, and thereâ€™s no place for women there. Afterwards, when you
939987 [17451] come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the
939987 [17452] highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and
939987 [17453] advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained
939987 [17454] ground, and the new woman will have appeared.â€
939987 [17455] 
939987 [17456] â€œMadam, thatâ€™s not the point, not at all....â€ Mitya clasped his hands in
939987 [17457] entreaty.
939987 [17458] 
939987 [17459] â€œYes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing
939987 [17460] youâ€™re yearning for, though you donâ€™t realize it yourself. I am not at all
939987 [17461] opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The
939987 [17462] development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the
939987 [17463] near futureâ€”thatâ€™s my ideal. Iâ€™ve a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
939987 [17464] people donâ€™t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author,
939987 [17465] Shtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the
939987 [17466] vocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two
939987 [17467] lines: â€˜I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.
939987 [17468] Persevere.â€™ And I signed myself, â€˜A Mother.â€™ I thought of signing myself
939987 [17469] â€˜A contemporary Mother,â€™ and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple
939987 [17470] â€˜Motherâ€™; thereâ€™s more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And the
939987 [17471] word â€˜contemporaryâ€™ might have reminded him of â€˜_The Contemporary_â€™â€”a
939987 [17472] painful recollection owing to the censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the
939987 [17473] matter!â€
939987 [17474] 
939987 [17475] â€œMadam!â€ cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her in
939987 [17476] helpless entreaty. â€œYou will make me weep if you delay what you have so
939987 [17477] generouslyâ€”â€
939987 [17478] 
939987 [17479] â€œOh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! Thatâ€™s a noble feeling ...
939987 [17480] such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later on
939987 [17481] you will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on purpose
939987 [17482] to share your joy with meâ€”â€
939987 [17483] 
939987 [17484] â€œBut allow me, too!â€ Mitya cried suddenly. â€œFor the last time I entreat
939987 [17485] you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when may
939987 [17486] I come for it?â€
939987 [17487] 
939987 [17488] â€œWhat sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [17489] 
939987 [17490] â€œThe three thousand you promised me ... that you so generouslyâ€”â€
939987 [17491] 
939987 [17492] â€œThree thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I havenâ€™t got three thousand,â€ Madame
939987 [17493] Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.
939987 [17494] 
939987 [17495] â€œWhy, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in my
939987 [17496] handsâ€”â€
939987 [17497] 
939987 [17498] â€œOh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you
939987 [17499] misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. Itâ€™s true I promised
939987 [17500] you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, but
939987 [17501] I was referring to the gold-mines.â€
939987 [17502] 
939987 [17503] â€œBut the money? The three thousand?â€ Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.
939987 [17504] 
939987 [17505] â€œOh, if you meant money, I havenâ€™t any. I havenâ€™t a penny, Dmitri
939987 [17506] Fyodorovitch. Iâ€™m quarreling with my steward about it, and Iâ€™ve just
939987 [17507] borrowed five hundred roubles from MiÃ¼sov, myself. No, no, Iâ€™ve no money.
939987 [17508] And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldnâ€™t give it to
939987 [17509] you. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means losing
939987 [17510] friends. And I wouldnâ€™t give it to you particularly. I wouldnâ€™t give it
939987 [17511] you, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is the
939987 [17512] gold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!â€
939987 [17513] 
939987 [17514] â€œOh, the devil!â€ roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fist
939987 [17515] down on the table.
939987 [17516] 
939987 [17517] â€œAie! Aie!â€ cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other end
939987 [17518] of the drawing-room.
939987 [17519] 
939987 [17520] Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of the
939987 [17521] house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one possessed,
939987 [17522] and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had struck himself
939987 [17523] two days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he saw him in the dark,
939987 [17524] on the road. What those blows upon his breast signified, _on that spot_,
939987 [17525] and what he meant by itâ€”that was, for the time, a secret which was known
939987 [17526] to no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that
939987 [17527] secret meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he had
939987 [17528] determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay
939987 [17529] his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast, from _that
939987 [17530] spot on his breast_, the shame he carried upon it, that weighed on his
939987 [17531] conscience. All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, but
939987 [17532] now that his last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance,
939987 [17533] burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovsâ€™
939987 [17534] house. He walked on, and not knowing what he was doing, wiped away his
939987 [17535] tears with his fist. In this way he reached the square, and suddenly
939987 [17536] became aware that he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing
939987 [17537] wail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.
939987 [17538] 
939987 [17539] â€œGood Lord, youâ€™ve nearly killed me! Why donâ€™t you look where youâ€™re
939987 [17540] going, scapegrace?â€
939987 [17541] 
939987 [17542] â€œWhy, itâ€™s you!â€ cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. It
939987 [17543] was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly
939987 [17544] noticed the day before.
939987 [17545] 
939987 [17546] â€œAnd who are you, my good sir?â€ said the old woman, in quite a different
939987 [17547] voice. â€œI donâ€™t know you in the dark.â€
939987 [17548] 
939987 [17549] â€œYou live at Kuzma Kuzmitchâ€™s. Youâ€™re the servant there?â€
939987 [17550] 
939987 [17551] â€œJust so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritchâ€™s.... But I donâ€™t know
939987 [17552] you now.â€
939987 [17553] 
939987 [17554] â€œTell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?â€ said Mitya,
939987 [17555] beside himself with suspense. â€œI saw her to the house some time ago.â€
939987 [17556] 
939987 [17557] â€œShe has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off again.â€
939987 [17558] 
939987 [17559] â€œWhat? Went away?â€ cried Mitya. â€œWhen did she go?â€
939987 [17560] 
939987 [17561] â€œWhy, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told Kuzma
939987 [17562] Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.â€
939987 [17563] 
939987 [17564] â€œYouâ€™re lying, damn you!â€ roared Mitya.
939987 [17565] 
939987 [17566] â€œAie! Aie!â€ shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.
939987 [17567] 
939987 [17568] He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the
939987 [17569] moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not more
939987 [17570] than a quarter of an hour after her departure.
939987 [17571] 
939987 [17572] Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the
939987 [17573] kitchen when â€œthe captainâ€ ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on
939987 [17574] seeing him.
939987 [17575] 
939987 [17576] â€œYou scream?â€ roared Mitya, â€œwhere is she?â€
939987 [17577] 
939987 [17578] But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fell
939987 [17579] all of a heap at her feet.
939987 [17580] 
939987 [17581] â€œFenya, for Christâ€™s sake, tell me, where is she?â€
939987 [17582] 
939987 [17583] â€œI donâ€™t know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I donâ€™t know. You may kill me
939987 [17584] but I canâ€™t tell you.â€ Fenya swore and protested. â€œYou went out with her
939987 [17585] yourself not long agoâ€”â€
939987 [17586] 
939987 [17587] â€œShe came back!â€
939987 [17588] 
939987 [17589] â€œIndeed she didnâ€™t. By God I swear she didnâ€™t come back.â€
939987 [17590] 
939987 [17591] â€œYouâ€™re lying!â€ shouted Mitya. â€œFrom your terror I know where she is.â€
939987 [17592] 
939987 [17593] He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily.
939987 [17594] But she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or she
939987 [17595] might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and
939987 [17596] old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar,
939987 [17597] with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches
939987 [17598] long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the
939987 [17599] other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.
939987 [17600] 
939987 [17601] â€œOh, Lord! Heâ€™s going to murder some one!â€ cried Fenya, flinging up her
939987 [17602] hands.
939987 [17603] 
939987 [17604] 
939987 [17605] 
939987 [17606] Chapter IV. In The Dark
939987 [17607] 
939987 [17608] 
939987 [17609] Where was he running? â€œWhere could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s?
939987 [17610] She must have run straight to him from Samsonovâ€™s, that was clear now. The
939987 [17611] whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.â€ ... It all rushed whirling
939987 [17612] through his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevnaâ€™s. â€œThere was no
939987 [17613] need to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ...
939987 [17614] they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the
939987 [17615] plot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!â€
939987 [17616] 
939987 [17617] He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor
939987 [17618] Pavlovitchâ€™s house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street,
939987 [17619] then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at
939987 [17620] the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle
939987 [17621] fence of a neighborâ€™s kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence,
939987 [17622] that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s garden. Here he chose a spot,
939987 [17623] apparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he knew
939987 [17624] Lizaveta had once climbed over it: â€œIf she could climb over it,â€ the
939987 [17625] thought, God knows why, occurred to him, â€œsurely I can.â€ He did in fact
939987 [17626] jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence.
939987 [17627] Then he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in
939987 [17628] the garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see the
939987 [17629] lighted windows of the house too.
939987 [17630] 
939987 [17631] â€œYes, the old manâ€™s bedroom is lighted up. Sheâ€™s there!â€ and he leapt from
939987 [17632] the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very likely
939987 [17633] Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he instinctively
939987 [17634] hid himself, stood still, and began to listen. But there was dead silence
939987 [17635] on all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not the
939987 [17636] slightest breath of wind.
939987 [17637] 
939987 [17638] â€œAnd naught but the whispering silence,â€ the line for some reason rose to
939987 [17639] his mind. â€œIf only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not.â€
939987 [17640] Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in the
939987 [17641] garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creeping
939987 [17642] stealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him five
939987 [17643] minutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under the
939987 [17644] window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam.
939987 [17645] The door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut;
939987 [17646] he had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached
939987 [17647] the bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. â€œI must wait now,â€ he
939987 [17648] thought, â€œto reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are
939987 [17649] listening ... if only I donâ€™t cough or sneeze.â€
939987 [17650] 
939987 [17651] He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at moments,
939987 [17652] he could scarcely breathe. â€œNo, this throbbing at my heart wonâ€™t stop,â€ he
939987 [17653] thought. â€œI canâ€™t wait any longer.â€ He was standing behind a bush in the
939987 [17654] shadow. The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush.
939987 [17655] 
939987 [17656] â€œHow red the whitebeam berries are!â€ he murmured, not knowing why. Softly
939987 [17657] and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and raised
939987 [17658] himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s bedroom lay open before him. It
939987 [17659] was not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen,
939987 [17660] â€œChinese,â€ as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word â€œChineseâ€
939987 [17661] flashed into Mityaâ€™s mind, â€œand behind the screen, is Grushenka,â€ thought
939987 [17662] Mitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his new
939987 [17663] striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord
939987 [17664] with tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with
939987 [17665] gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his head
939987 [17666] Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen.
939987 [17667] 
939987 [17668] â€œHe has got himself up,â€ thought Mitya.
939987 [17669] 
939987 [17670] His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought.
939987 [17671] Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing
939987 [17672] went up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter
939987 [17673] and drank it off. Then he uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a moment,
939987 [17674] walked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand
939987 [17675] raised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his
939987 [17676] bruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.
939987 [17677] 
939987 [17678] â€œHeâ€™s alone,â€ thought Mitya, â€œin all probability heâ€™s alone.â€
939987 [17679] 
939987 [17680] Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly to
939987 [17681] the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.
939987 [17682] 
939987 [17683] â€œShe may be there behind the screen. Perhaps sheâ€™s asleep by now,â€ he
939987 [17684] thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the
939987 [17685] window. â€œHeâ€™s looking for her out of the window, so sheâ€™s not there. Why
939987 [17686] should he stare out into the dark? Heâ€™s wild with impatience.â€ ... Mitya
939987 [17687] slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old
939987 [17688] man was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put
939987 [17689] his elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya
939987 [17690] watched him eagerly.
939987 [17691] 
939987 [17692] â€œHeâ€™s alone, heâ€™s alone!â€ he repeated again. â€œIf she were here, his face
939987 [17693] would be different.â€
939987 [17694] 
939987 [17695] Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she
939987 [17696] was not here. â€œItâ€™s not that sheâ€™s not here,â€ he explained to himself,
939987 [17697] immediately, â€œbut that I canâ€™t tell for certain whether she is or not.â€
939987 [17698] Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally
939987 [17699] clear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no
939987 [17700] point. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision,
939987 [17701] was growing in his heart with every instant. â€œIs she here or not?â€ The
939987 [17702] angry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out
939987 [17703] his hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the
939987 [17704] old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times
939987 [17705] more quickly, the signal that meant â€œGrushenka is here!â€
939987 [17706] 
939987 [17707] The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to
939987 [17708] the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch opened
939987 [17709] the window and thrust his whole head out.
939987 [17710] 
939987 [17711] â€œGrushenka, is it you? Is it you?â€ he said, in a sort of trembling
939987 [17712] half-whisper. â€œWhere are you, my angel, where are you?â€ He was fearfully
939987 [17713] agitated and breathless.
939987 [17714] 
939987 [17715] â€œHeâ€™s alone.â€ Mitya decided.
939987 [17716] 
939987 [17717] â€œWhere are you?â€ cried the old man again; and he thrust his head out
939987 [17718] farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, right
939987 [17719] and left. â€œCome here, Iâ€™ve a little present for you. Come, Iâ€™ll show
939987 [17720] you....â€
939987 [17721] 
939987 [17722] â€œHe means the three thousand,â€ thought Mitya.
939987 [17723] 
939987 [17724] â€œBut where are you? Are you at the door? Iâ€™ll open it directly.â€
939987 [17725] 
939987 [17726] And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the
939987 [17727] right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the
939987 [17728] darkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open the
939987 [17729] door without waiting for Grushenkaâ€™s answer.
939987 [17730] 
939987 [17731] Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old manâ€™s profile
939987 [17732] that he loathed so, his pendent Adamâ€™s apple, his hooked nose, his lips
939987 [17733] that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by the
939987 [17734] slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A horrible fury of
939987 [17735] hatred suddenly surged up in Mityaâ€™s heart: â€œThere he was, his rival, the
939987 [17736] man who had tormented him, had ruined his life!â€ It was a rush of that
939987 [17737] sudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as though
939987 [17738] foreseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to
939987 [17739] Alyoshaâ€™s question, â€œHow can you say youâ€™ll kill our father?â€ â€œI donâ€™t
939987 [17740] know, I donâ€™t know,â€ he had said then. â€œPerhaps I shall not kill him,
939987 [17741] perhaps I shall. Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that
939987 [17742] moment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. I
939987 [17743] feel a personal repulsion. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m afraid of, thatâ€™s what may be
939987 [17744] too much for me.â€ ... This personal repulsion was growing unendurable.
939987 [17745] Mitya was beside himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his
939987 [17746] pocket.
939987 [17747] 
939987 [17748]                   -------------------------------------
939987 [17749] 
939987 [17750] â€œGod was watching over me then,â€ Mitya himself said afterwards. At that
939987 [17751] very moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in the
939987 [17752] evening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described to
939987 [17753] Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, very
939987 [17754] strong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wife
939987 [17755] repeated a â€œcertain prayerâ€ over him, after which he had gone to bed.
939987 [17756] Marfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong
939987 [17757] drink, slept like the dead beside her husband.
939987 [17758] 
939987 [17759] But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a momentâ€™s
939987 [17760] reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back, he sat up
939987 [17761] in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhaps
939987 [17762] his conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was
939987 [17763] unguarded â€œin such perilous times.â€ Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay
939987 [17764] motionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. â€œThe stuffâ€™s
939987 [17765] been too much for the woman,â€ Grigory thought, glancing at her, and
939987 [17766] groaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out
939987 [17767] from the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and
939987 [17768] his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not
939987 [17769] locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the most
939987 [17770] punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine,
939987 [17771] and habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went
939987 [17772] down the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open.
939987 [17773] Mechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something,
939987 [17774] perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his masterâ€™s
939987 [17775] window open. No one was looking out of it then.
939987 [17776] 
939987 [17777] â€œWhatâ€™s it open for? Itâ€™s not summer now,â€ thought Grigory, and suddenly,
939987 [17778] at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before
939987 [17779] him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running
939987 [17780] in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.
939987 [17781] 
939987 [17782] â€œGood Lord!â€ cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his
939987 [17783] back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut,
939987 [17784] evidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the
939987 [17785] bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigory
939987 [17786] followed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything. He
939987 [17787] reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory
939987 [17788] cried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two
939987 [17789] hands.
939987 [17790] 
939987 [17791] Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he,
939987 [17792] the â€œmonster,â€ the â€œparricide.â€
939987 [17793] 
939987 [17794] â€œParricide!â€ the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could
939987 [17795] hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck
939987 [17796] by lightning.
939987 [17797] 
939987 [17798] Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mityaâ€™s
939987 [17799] hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The
939987 [17800] pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a
939987 [17801] most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure
939987 [17802] before him. The old manâ€™s head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his
939987 [17803] hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had
939987 [17804] been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old manâ€™s
939987 [17805] skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing
939987 [17806] horribly; and in a moment Mityaâ€™s fingers were drenched with the hot
939987 [17807] stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white
939987 [17808] handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame
939987 [17809] Hohlakov, and putting it to the old manâ€™s head, senselessly trying to wipe
939987 [17810] the blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly
939987 [17811] soaked with blood.
939987 [17812] 
939987 [17813] â€œGood heavens! what am I doing it for?â€ thought Mitya, suddenly pulling
939987 [17814] himself together. â€œIf I have broken his skull, how can I find out now? And
939987 [17815] what difference does it make now?â€ he added, hopelessly. â€œIf Iâ€™ve killed
939987 [17816] him, Iâ€™ve killed him.... Youâ€™ve come to grief, old man, so there you must
939987 [17817] lie!â€ he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over it
939987 [17818] into the lane and fell to runningâ€”the handkerchief soaked with blood he
939987 [17819] held, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the
939987 [17820] back pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met
939987 [17821] him in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a
939987 [17822] man running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozovâ€™s house.
939987 [17823] 
939987 [17824] Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the
939987 [17825] chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christâ€™s sake, â€œnot
939987 [17826] to let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.â€ Nazar Ivanovitch
939987 [17827] promised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him,
939987 [17828] and meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from the
939987 [17829] country, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention
939987 [17830] â€œthe captain.â€ Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly
939987 [17831] recognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gate
939987 [17832] at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humored
939987 [17833] smile that â€œAgrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.â€
939987 [17834] 
939987 [17835] â€œWhere is she then, Prohor?â€ asked Mitya, stopping short.
939987 [17836] 
939987 [17837] â€œShe set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.â€
939987 [17838] 
939987 [17839] â€œWhat for?â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [17840] 
939987 [17841] â€œThat I canâ€™t say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horses
939987 [17842] were sent to fetch her.â€
939987 [17843] 
939987 [17844] Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.
939987 [17845] 
939987 [17846] 
939987 [17847] 
939987 [17848] Chapter V. A Sudden Resolution
939987 [17849] 
939987 [17850] 
939987 [17851] She was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were both just
939987 [17852] going to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselves
939987 [17853] in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her by the throat.
939987 [17854] 
939987 [17855] â€œSpeak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?â€ he roared
939987 [17856] furiously.
939987 [17857] 
939987 [17858] Both the women squealed.
939987 [17859] 
939987 [17860] â€œAie! Iâ€™ll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, Iâ€™ll tell you
939987 [17861] everything directly, I wonâ€™t hide anything,â€ gabbled Fenya, frightened to
939987 [17862] death; â€œsheâ€™s gone to Mokroe, to her officer.â€
939987 [17863] 
939987 [17864] â€œWhat officer?â€ roared Mitya.
939987 [17865] 
939987 [17866] â€œTo her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who threw her over
939987 [17867] five years ago,â€ cackled Fenya, as fast as she could speak.
939987 [17868] 
939987 [17869] Mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat. He stood
939987 [17870] facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his eyes showed
939987 [17871] that he realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed the whole
939987 [17872] position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observe
939987 [17873] whether he understood or not. She remained sitting on the trunk as she had
939987 [17874] been when he ran into the room, trembling all over, holding her hands out
939987 [17875] before her as though trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown
939987 [17876] rigid in that position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably
939987 [17877] upon him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared with
939987 [17878] blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead with them,
939987 [17879] wiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and his right cheek
939987 [17880] were blood-stained patches. Fenya was on the verge of hysterics. The old
939987 [17881] cook had jumped up and was staring at him like a mad woman, almost
939987 [17882] unconscious with terror.
939987 [17883] 
939987 [17884] Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next to
939987 [17885] Fenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken, benumbed.
939987 [17886] Yet everything was clear as day: that officer, he knew about him, he knew
939987 [17887] everything perfectly, he had known it from Grushenka herself, had known
939987 [17888] that a letter had come from him a month before. So that for a month, for a
939987 [17889] whole month, this had been going on, a secret from him, till the very
939987 [17890] arrival of this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could
939987 [17891] he, how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten this
939987 [17892] officer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him? That was the
939987 [17893] question that faced him like some monstrous thing. And he looked at this
939987 [17894] monstrous thing with horror, growing cold with horror.
939987 [17895] 
939987 [17896] But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child, he
939987 [17897] began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he had
939987 [17898] scared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning Fenya with an extreme
939987 [17899] preciseness, astonishing in his position, and though the girl looked
939987 [17900] wildly at his blood-stained hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness and
939987 [17901] rapidity, answered every question as though eager to put the whole truth
939987 [17902] and nothing but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sort
939987 [17903] of enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to torment
939987 [17904] him, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him. She
939987 [17905] described the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin and
939987 [17906] Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress had set
939987 [17907] off, and how she had called out of the window to Alyosha to give him,
939987 [17908] Mitya, her greetings, and to tell him â€œto remember for ever how she had
939987 [17909] loved him for an hour.â€
939987 [17910] 
939987 [17911] Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush of
939987 [17912] color on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him, not a bit
939987 [17913] afraid now to be inquisitive:
939987 [17914] 
939987 [17915] â€œLook at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Theyâ€™re all over blood!â€
939987 [17916] 
939987 [17917] â€œYes,â€ answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his hands and
939987 [17918] at once forgot them and Fenyaâ€™s question.
939987 [17919] 
939987 [17920] He sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he had run in.
939987 [17921] His first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed determination had
939987 [17922] taken possession of him. He suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily.
939987 [17923] 
939987 [17924] â€œWhat has happened to you, sir?â€ said Fenya, pointing to his hands again.
939987 [17925] She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very near to him now in his
939987 [17926] grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.
939987 [17927] 
939987 [17928] â€œThatâ€™s blood, Fenya,â€ he said, looking at her with a strange expression.
939987 [17929] â€œThatâ€™s human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But ... Fenya ...
939987 [17930] thereâ€™s a fence hereâ€ (he looked at her as though setting her a riddle),
939987 [17931] â€œa high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn to-morrow, when the
939987 [17932] sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You donâ€™t understand what
939987 [17933] fence, Fenya, and, never mind.... Youâ€™ll hear to-morrow and understand ...
939987 [17934] and now, good-by. I wonâ€™t stand in her way. Iâ€™ll step aside, I know how to
939987 [17935] step aside. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka
939987 [17936] Karamazov so for ever.... She always used to call me Mityenka, do you
939987 [17937] remember?â€
939987 [17938] 
939987 [17939] And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was almost
939987 [17940] more frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when he ran in
939987 [17941] and attacked her.
939987 [17942] 
939987 [17943] Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the young
939987 [17944] official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by now half-past
939987 [17945] eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening tea, and had just put
939987 [17946] his coat on again to go to the â€œMetropolisâ€ to play billiards. Mitya
939987 [17947] caught him coming out.
939987 [17948] 
939987 [17949] Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered a
939987 [17950] cry of surprise.
939987 [17951] 
939987 [17952] â€œGood heavens! What is the matter?â€
939987 [17953] 
939987 [17954] â€œIâ€™ve come for my pistols,â€ said Mitya, â€œand brought you the money. And
939987 [17955] thanks very much. Iâ€™m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.â€
939987 [17956] 
939987 [17957] Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of a
939987 [17958] bundle of bank-notes in Mityaâ€™s hand, and what was more, he had walked in
939987 [17959] holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he had them
939987 [17960] in his right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them.
939987 [17961] Perhotinâ€™s servant-boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that
939987 [17962] he walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in
939987 [17963] his hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in the
939987 [17964] streets. They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and the
939987 [17965] fingers holding them were covered with blood.
939987 [17966] 
939987 [17967] When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he said
939987 [17968] that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have been
939987 [17969] two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, â€œfatâ€ bundle. â€œDmitri
939987 [17970] Fyodorovitch,â€ so he testified afterwards, â€œseemed unlike himself, too;
939987 [17971] not drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same
939987 [17972] time, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for
939987 [17973] something and unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste,
939987 [17974] answered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all
939987 [17975] dejected but quite cheerful.â€
939987 [17976] 
939987 [17977] â€œBut what _is_ the matter with you? Whatâ€™s wrong?â€ cried Pyotr Ilyitch,
939987 [17978] looking wildly at his guest. â€œHow is it that youâ€™re all covered with
939987 [17979] blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!â€
939987 [17980] 
939987 [17981] He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.
939987 [17982] 
939987 [17983] Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.
939987 [17984] 
939987 [17985] â€œDamnation! Thatâ€™s the last straw,â€ he muttered angrily, hurriedly
939987 [17986] changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively jerked
939987 [17987] the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief turned out to be
939987 [17988] soaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief he had used to wipe
939987 [17989] Grigoryâ€™s face). There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not
939987 [17990] merely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not
939987 [17991] be pulled apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.
939987 [17992] 
939987 [17993] â€œOh, damn it!â€ he said. â€œHavenâ€™t you a rag of some sort ... to wipe my
939987 [17994] face?â€
939987 [17995] 
939987 [17996] â€œSo youâ€™re only stained, not wounded? Youâ€™d better wash,â€ said Pyotr
939987 [17997] Ilyitch. â€œHereâ€™s a wash-stand. Iâ€™ll pour you out some water.â€
939987 [17998] 
939987 [17999] â€œA wash-stand? Thatâ€™s all right ... but where am I to put this?â€
939987 [18000] 
939987 [18001] With the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred-rouble
939987 [18002] notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him to
939987 [18003] decide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.
939987 [18004] 
939987 [18005] â€œIn your pocket, or on the table here. They wonâ€™t be lost.â€
939987 [18006] 
939987 [18007] â€œIn my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, thatâ€™s all
939987 [18008] nonsense,â€ he cried, as though suddenly coming out of his absorption.
939987 [18009] â€œLook here, letâ€™s first settle that business of the pistols. Give them
939987 [18010] back to me. Hereâ€™s your money ... because I am in great need of them ...
939987 [18011] and I havenâ€™t a minute, a minute to spare.â€
939987 [18012] 
939987 [18013] And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr
939987 [18014] Ilyitch.
939987 [18015] 
939987 [18016] â€œBut I shanâ€™t have change enough. Havenâ€™t you less?â€
939987 [18017] 
939987 [18018] â€œNo,â€ said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not trusting
939987 [18019] his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones.
939987 [18020] 
939987 [18021] â€œNo, theyâ€™re all alike,â€ he added, and again he looked inquiringly at
939987 [18022] Pyotr Ilyitch.
939987 [18023] 
939987 [18024] â€œHow have you grown so rich?â€ the latter asked. â€œWait, Iâ€™ll send my boy to
939987 [18025] Plotnikovâ€™s, they close lateâ€”to see if they wonâ€™t change it. Here, Misha!â€
939987 [18026] he called into the passage.
939987 [18027] 
939987 [18028] â€œTo Plotnikovâ€™s shopâ€”first-rate!â€ cried Mitya, as though struck by an
939987 [18029] idea. â€œMisha,â€ he turned to the boy as he came in, â€œlook here, run to
939987 [18030] Plotnikovâ€™s and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings,
939987 [18031] and will be there directly.... But listen, listen, tell them to have
939987 [18032] champagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it was
939987 [18033] to take to Mokroe. I took four dozen with me then,â€ he added (suddenly
939987 [18034] addressing Pyotr Ilyitch); â€œthey know all about it, donâ€™t you trouble,
939987 [18035] Misha,â€ he turned again to the boy. â€œStay, listen; tell them to put in
939987 [18036] cheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything,
939987 [18037] everything theyâ€™ve got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty
939987 [18038] as before.... But wait: donâ€™t let them forget dessert, sweets, pears,
939987 [18039] water-melons, two or three or fourâ€”no, one melonâ€™s enough, and chocolate,
939987 [18040] candy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before,
939987 [18041] three hundred roublesâ€™ worth with the champagne ... let it be just the
939987 [18042] same again. And remember, Misha, if you are called Mishaâ€”His name is
939987 [18043] Misha, isnâ€™t it?â€ He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again.
939987 [18044] 
939987 [18045] â€œWait a minute,â€ Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching him
939987 [18046] uneasily, â€œyouâ€™d better go yourself and tell them. Heâ€™ll muddle it.â€
939987 [18047] 
939987 [18048] â€œHe will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for the
939987 [18049] commission.... If you donâ€™t make a mistake, thereâ€™s ten roubles for you,
939987 [18050] run along, make haste.... Champagneâ€™s the chief thing, let them bring up
939987 [18051] champagne. And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I had then....
939987 [18052] They know what I had then.â€
939987 [18053] 
939987 [18054] â€œBut listen!â€ Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. â€œI say, let
939987 [18055] him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and you go
939987 [18056] and tell them.... Give him your note. Be off, Misha! Put your best leg
939987 [18057] forward!â€
939987 [18058] 
939987 [18059] Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boy
939987 [18060] remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently
939987 [18061] understanding little of Mityaâ€™s orders, gazing up with amazement and
939987 [18062] terror at his blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers
939987 [18063] that held the notes.
939987 [18064] 
939987 [18065] â€œWell, now come and wash,â€ said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. â€œPut the money on
939987 [18066] the table or else in your pocket.... Thatâ€™s right, come along. But take
939987 [18067] off your coat.â€
939987 [18068] 
939987 [18069] And beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:
939987 [18070] 
939987 [18071] â€œLook, your coatâ€™s covered with blood, too!â€
939987 [18072] 
939987 [18073] â€œThat ... itâ€™s not the coat. Itâ€™s only a little here on the sleeve.... And
939987 [18074] thatâ€™s only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have soaked through.
939987 [18075] I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenyaâ€™s, and the bloodâ€™s come
939987 [18076] through,â€ Mitya explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness that
939987 [18077] was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.
939987 [18078] 
939987 [18079] â€œWell, you must have been up to something; you must have been fighting
939987 [18080] with some one,â€ he muttered.
939987 [18081] 
939987 [18082] They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water.
939987 [18083] Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands (they were trembling,
939987 [18084] and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards). But the young official
939987 [18085] insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more. He seemed
939987 [18086] to exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on. It may be
939987 [18087] noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character.
939987 [18088] 
939987 [18089] â€œLook, you havenâ€™t got your nails clean. Now rub your face; here, on your
939987 [18090] temples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you going?
939987 [18091] Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.â€
939987 [18092] 
939987 [18093] â€œYes, itâ€™s all bloody,â€ observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his shirt.
939987 [18094] 
939987 [18095] â€œThen change your shirt.â€
939987 [18096] 
939987 [18097] â€œI havenâ€™t time. You see Iâ€™ll ...â€ Mitya went on with the same confiding
939987 [18098] ingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel, and putting on his
939987 [18099] coat. â€œIâ€™ll turn it up at the wrist. It wonâ€™t be seen under the coat....
939987 [18100] You see!â€
939987 [18101] 
939987 [18102] â€œTell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting with
939987 [18103] some one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating that
939987 [18104] captain again?â€ Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully. â€œWhom have you been
939987 [18105] beating now ... or killing, perhaps?â€
939987 [18106] 
939987 [18107] â€œNonsense!â€ said Mitya.
939987 [18108] 
939987 [18109] â€œWhy â€˜nonsenseâ€™?â€
939987 [18110] 
939987 [18111] â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. â€œI smashed an old
939987 [18112] woman in the market-place just now.â€
939987 [18113] 
939987 [18114] â€œSmashed? An old woman?â€
939987 [18115] 
939987 [18116] â€œAn old man!â€ cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face,
939987 [18117] laughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.
939987 [18118] 
939987 [18119] â€œConfound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?â€
939987 [18120] 
939987 [18121] â€œWe made it up. We had a rowâ€”and made it up. In a place I know of. We
939987 [18122] parted friends. A fool.... Heâ€™s forgiven me.... Heâ€™s sure to have forgiven
939987 [18123] me by now ... if he had got up, he wouldnâ€™t have forgiven meâ€â€”Mitya
939987 [18124] suddenly winkedâ€”â€œonly damn him, you know, I say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him!
939987 [18125] Donâ€™t worry about him! I donâ€™t want to just now!â€ Mitya snapped out,
939987 [18126] resolutely.
939987 [18127] 
939987 [18128] â€œWhatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ... Just
939987 [18129] as you did with that captain over some nonsense.... Youâ€™ve been fighting
939987 [18130] and now youâ€™re rushing off on the spreeâ€”thatâ€™s you all over! Three dozen
939987 [18131] champagneâ€”what do you want all that for?â€
939987 [18132] 
939987 [18133] â€œBravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor Iâ€™ve no time now. I should
939987 [18134] like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I havenâ€™t the time. And
939987 [18135] thereâ€™s no need, itâ€™s too late for talking. Whereâ€™s my money? Where have I
939987 [18136] put it?â€ he cried, thrusting his hands into his pockets.
939987 [18137] 
939987 [18138] â€œYou put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had you forgotten?
939987 [18139] Moneyâ€™s like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are your pistols. Itâ€™s
939987 [18140] an odd thing, at six oâ€™clock you pledged them for ten roubles, and now
939987 [18141] youâ€™ve got thousands. Two or three I should say.â€
939987 [18142] 
939987 [18143] â€œThree, you bet,â€ laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocket
939987 [18144] of his trousers.
939987 [18145] 
939987 [18146] â€œYouâ€™ll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine?â€
939987 [18147] 
939987 [18148] â€œThe mines? The gold-mines?â€ Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and
939987 [18149] went off into a roar of laughter. â€œWould you like to go to the mines,
939987 [18150] Perhotin? Thereâ€™s a lady here whoâ€™ll stump up three thousand for you, if
939987 [18151] only youâ€™ll go. She did it for me, sheâ€™s so awfully fond of gold-mines. Do
939987 [18152] you know Madame Hohlakov?â€
939987 [18153] 
939987 [18154] â€œI donâ€™t know her, but Iâ€™ve heard of her and seen her. Did she really give
939987 [18155] you three thousand? Did she really?â€ said Pyotr Ilyitch, eyeing him
939987 [18156] dubiously.
939987 [18157] 
939987 [18158] â€œAs soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as PhÅ“bus, ever young, flies
939987 [18159] upwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this Madame Hohlakov,
939987 [18160] and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not. Try and
939987 [18161] find out.â€
939987 [18162] 
939987 [18163] â€œI donâ€™t know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively, I
939987 [18164] suppose she did give it to you. Youâ€™ve got the money in your hand, but
939987 [18165] instead of going to Siberia youâ€™re spending it all.... Where are you
939987 [18166] really off to now, eh?â€
939987 [18167] 
939987 [18168] â€œTo Mokroe.â€
939987 [18169] 
939987 [18170] â€œTo Mokroe? But itâ€™s night!â€
939987 [18171] 
939987 [18172] â€œOnce the lad had all, now the lad has naught,â€ cried Mitya suddenly.
939987 [18173] 
939987 [18174] â€œHow â€˜naughtâ€™? You say that with all those thousands!â€
939987 [18175] 
939987 [18176] â€œIâ€™m not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! Iâ€™m talking of the
939987 [18177] female character.
939987 [18178] 
939987 [18179] 
939987 [18180]     Fickle is the heart of woman
939987 [18181]     Treacherous and full of vice;
939987 [18182] 
939987 [18183] 
939987 [18184] I agree with Ulysses. Thatâ€™s what he says.â€
939987 [18185] 
939987 [18186] â€œI donâ€™t understand you!â€
939987 [18187] 
939987 [18188] â€œAm I drunk?â€
939987 [18189] 
939987 [18190] â€œNot drunk, but worse.â€
939987 [18191] 
939987 [18192] â€œIâ€™m drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But thatâ€™s enough!â€
939987 [18193] 
939987 [18194] â€œWhat are you doing, loading the pistol?â€
939987 [18195] 
939987 [18196] â€œIâ€™m loading the pistol.â€
939987 [18197] 
939987 [18198] Unfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder horn, and
939987 [18199] carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he took the bullet and,
939987 [18200] before inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the candle.
939987 [18201] 
939987 [18202] â€œWhy are you looking at the bullet?â€ asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching him
939987 [18203] with uneasy curiosity.
939987 [18204] 
939987 [18205] â€œOh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, would
939987 [18206] you look at it or not?â€
939987 [18207] 
939987 [18208] â€œWhy look at it?â€
939987 [18209] 
939987 [18210] â€œItâ€™s going into my brain, so itâ€™s interesting to look and see what itâ€™s
939987 [18211] like. But thatâ€™s foolishness, a momentâ€™s foolishness. Now thatâ€™s done,â€ he
939987 [18212] added, putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod. â€œPyotr
939987 [18213] Ilyitch, my dear fellow, thatâ€™s nonsense, all nonsense, and if only you
939987 [18214] knew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper now.â€
939987 [18215] 
939987 [18216] â€œHereâ€™s some paper.â€
939987 [18217] 
939987 [18218] â€œNo, a clean new piece, writing-paper. Thatâ€™s right.â€
939987 [18219] 
939987 [18220] And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded the
939987 [18221] paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He put the pistols
939987 [18222] in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand. Then he looked at
939987 [18223] Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.
939987 [18224] 
939987 [18225] â€œNow, letâ€™s go.â€
939987 [18226] 
939987 [18227] â€œWhere are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking of putting
939987 [18228] that bullet in your brain, perhaps?â€ Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily.
939987 [18229] 
939987 [18230] â€œI was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You may be
939987 [18231] sure of that. I love golden-haired PhÅ“bus and his warm light.... Dear
939987 [18232] Pyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?â€
939987 [18233] 
939987 [18234] â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜stepping asideâ€™?â€
939987 [18235] 
939987 [18236] â€œMaking way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I hate. And to
939987 [18237] let the one I hate become dearâ€”thatâ€™s what making way means! And to say to
939987 [18238] them: God bless you, go your way, pass on, while Iâ€”â€
939987 [18239] 
939987 [18240] â€œWhile youâ€”?â€
939987 [18241] 
939987 [18242] â€œThatâ€™s enough, letâ€™s go.â€
939987 [18243] 
939987 [18244] â€œUpon my word. Iâ€™ll tell some one to prevent your going there,â€ said Pyotr
939987 [18245] Ilyitch, looking at him. â€œWhat are you going to Mokroe for, now?â€
939987 [18246] 
939987 [18247] â€œThereâ€™s a woman there, a woman. Thatâ€™s enough for you. You shut up.â€
939987 [18248] 
939987 [18249] â€œListen, though youâ€™re such a savage Iâ€™ve always liked you.... I feel
939987 [18250] anxious.â€
939987 [18251] 
939987 [18252] â€œThanks, old fellow. Iâ€™m a savage you say. Savages, savages! Thatâ€™s what I
939987 [18253] am always saying. Savages! Why, hereâ€™s Misha! I was forgetting him.â€
939987 [18254] 
939987 [18255] Misha ran in, post-haste, with a handful of notes in change, and reported
939987 [18256] that every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovsâ€™; â€œTheyâ€™re carrying down
939987 [18257] the bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be ready directly.â€
939987 [18258] Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch, then tossed
939987 [18259] another ten-rouble note to Misha.
939987 [18260] 
939987 [18261] â€œDonâ€™t dare to do such a thing!â€ cried Pyotr Ilyitch. â€œI wonâ€™t have it in
939987 [18262] my house, itâ€™s a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here, put
939987 [18263] it here, why waste it? It would come in handy to-morrow, and I dare say
939987 [18264] youâ€™ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keep
939987 [18265] putting the notes in your side-pocket? Ah, youâ€™ll lose them!â€
939987 [18266] 
939987 [18267] â€œI say, my dear fellow, letâ€™s go to Mokroe together.â€
939987 [18268] 
939987 [18269] â€œWhat should I go for?â€
939987 [18270] 
939987 [18271] â€œI say, letâ€™s open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to drink,
939987 [18272] and especially to drink with you. Iâ€™ve never drunk with you, have I?â€
939987 [18273] 
939987 [18274] â€œVery well, we can go to the â€˜Metropolis.â€™ I was just going there.â€
939987 [18275] 
939987 [18276] â€œI havenâ€™t time for that. Letâ€™s drink at the Plotnikovsâ€™, in the back
939987 [18277] room. Shall I ask you a riddle?â€
939987 [18278] 
939987 [18279] â€œAsk away.â€
939987 [18280] 
939987 [18281] Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded it and
939987 [18282] showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: â€œI punish myself for my
939987 [18283] whole life, my whole life I punish!â€
939987 [18284] 
939987 [18285] â€œI will certainly speak to some one, Iâ€™ll go at once,â€ said Pyotr Ilyitch,
939987 [18286] after reading the paper.
939987 [18287] 
939987 [18288] â€œYou wonâ€™t have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!â€
939987 [18289] 
939987 [18290] Plotnikovâ€™s shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one to
939987 [18291] Pyotr Ilyitchâ€™s. It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by no
939987 [18292] means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants. They kept everything
939987 [18293] that could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, wines
939987 [18294] â€œbottled by the brothers Eliseyev,â€ fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar,
939987 [18295] and so on. There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always
939987 [18296] employed. Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners
939987 [18297] had gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished
939987 [18298] as before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of
939987 [18299] purchasers for their goods.
939987 [18300] 
939987 [18301] They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had vivid
939987 [18302] recollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine and
939987 [18303] goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for in
939987 [18304] cash (they would never have let him have anything on credit, of course).
939987 [18305] They remembered that then, as now, he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble
939987 [18306] notes in his hand, and had scattered them at random, without bargaining,
939987 [18307] without reflecting, or caring to reflect what use so much wine and
939987 [18308] provisions would be to him. The story was told all over the town that,
939987 [18309] driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had â€œspent three thousand in
939987 [18310] one night and the following day, and had come back from the spree without
939987 [18311] a penny.â€ He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped in our
939987 [18312] neighborhood at the time), who for two days got money without stint out of
939987 [18313] him while he was drunk, and drank expensive wine without stint. People
939987 [18314] used to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he had given champagne to
939987 [18315] grimy-handed peasants, and feasted the village women and girls on sweets
939987 [18316] and Strasburg pies. Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a
939987 [18317] risky proceeding, there was much laughter behind his back, especially in
939987 [18318] the tavern, at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of
939987 [18319] Grushenka by this â€œescapadeâ€ was â€œpermission to kiss her foot, and that
939987 [18320] was the utmost she had allowed him.â€
939987 [18321] 
939987 [18322] By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cart
939987 [18323] with three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, the
939987 [18324] driver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the shop they had
939987 [18325] almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were only
939987 [18326] waiting for Mityaâ€™s arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart. Pyotr
939987 [18327] Ilyitch was astounded.
939987 [18328] 
939987 [18329] â€œWhere did this cart come from in such a hurry?â€ he asked Mitya.
939987 [18330] 
939987 [18331] â€œI met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here to the
939987 [18332] shop. Thereâ€™s no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but Timofey
939987 [18333] now has gone on before me with the witch. Shall we be very late, Andrey?â€
939987 [18334] 
939987 [18335] â€œTheyâ€™ll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe. I
939987 [18336] got Timofey ready to start. I know how heâ€™ll go. Their pace wonâ€™t be ours,
939987 [18337] Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They wonâ€™t get there an hour
939987 [18338] earlier!â€ Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driver, wearing a
939987 [18339] full-skirted coat, and with a kaftan on his arm, replied warmly.
939987 [18340] 
939987 [18341] â€œFifty roubles for vodka if weâ€™re only an hour behind them.â€
939987 [18342] 
939987 [18343] â€œI warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they wonâ€™t be half an hour
939987 [18344] before us, let alone an hour.â€
939987 [18345] 
939987 [18346] Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his orders
939987 [18347] strangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began a
939987 [18348] sentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to
939987 [18349] come to the rescue.
939987 [18350] 
939987 [18351] â€œFour hundred roublesâ€™ worth, not less than four hundred roublesâ€™ worth,
939987 [18352] just as it was then,â€ commanded Mitya. â€œFour dozen champagne, not a bottle
939987 [18353] less.â€
939987 [18354] 
939987 [18355] â€œWhat do you want with so much? Whatâ€™s it for? Stay!â€ cried Pyotr Ilyitch.
939987 [18356] â€œWhatâ€™s this box? Whatâ€™s in it? Surely there isnâ€™t four hundred roublesâ€™
939987 [18357] worth here?â€
939987 [18358] 
939987 [18359] The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first
939987 [18360] box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only â€œthe most
939987 [18361] indispensable articles,â€ such as savories, sweets, toffee, etc. But the
939987 [18362] main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off, as on the
939987 [18363] previous occasion, in a special cart also with three horses traveling at
939987 [18364] full speed, so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than
939987 [18365] Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.
939987 [18366] 
939987 [18367] â€œNot more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee and
939987 [18368] fondants. The girls there are so fond of it,â€ Mitya insisted hotly.
939987 [18369] 
939987 [18370] â€œThe fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen of
939987 [18371] champagne? One would be enough,â€ said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry. He
939987 [18372] began bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to be
939987 [18373] satisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles. In the end
939987 [18374] it was agreed that only three hundred roublesâ€™ worth should be sent.
939987 [18375] 
939987 [18376] â€œWell, you may go to the devil!â€ cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second thoughts.
939987 [18377] â€œWhatâ€™s it to do with me? Throw away your money, since itâ€™s cost you
939987 [18378] nothing.â€
939987 [18379] 
939987 [18380] â€œThis way, my economist, this way, donâ€™t be angry.â€ Mitya drew him into a
939987 [18381] room at the back of the shop. â€œTheyâ€™ll give us a bottle here directly.
939987 [18382] Weâ€™ll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for youâ€™re a nice
939987 [18383] fellow, the sort I like.â€
939987 [18384] 
939987 [18385] Mitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with a
939987 [18386] dirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagne
939987 [18387] soon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen. â€œFirst-class
939987 [18388] oysters, the last lot in.â€
939987 [18389] 
939987 [18390] â€œHang the oysters. I donâ€™t eat them. And we donâ€™t need anything,â€ cried
939987 [18391] Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.
939987 [18392] 
939987 [18393] â€œThereâ€™s no time for oysters,â€ said Mitya. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not hungry. Do you
939987 [18394] know, friend,â€ he said suddenly, with feeling, â€œI never have liked all
939987 [18395] this disorder.â€
939987 [18396] 
939987 [18397] â€œWho does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word,
939987 [18398] thatâ€™s enough to make any one angry!â€
939987 [18399] 
939987 [18400] â€œThatâ€™s not what I mean. Iâ€™m talking of a higher order. Thereâ€™s no order
939987 [18401] in me, no higher order. But ... thatâ€™s all over. Thereâ€™s no need to grieve
939987 [18402] about it. Itâ€™s too late, damn it! My whole life has been disorder, and one
939987 [18403] must set it in order. Is that a pun, eh?â€
939987 [18404] 
939987 [18405] â€œYouâ€™re raving, not making puns!â€
939987 [18406] 
939987 [18407] 
939987 [18408]     â€œGlory be to God in Heaven,
939987 [18409]     Glory be to God in me....
939987 [18410] 
939987 [18411] 
939987 [18412] â€œThat verse came from my heart once, itâ€™s not a verse, but a tear.... I
939987 [18413] made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captainâ€™s beard,
939987 [18414] though....â€
939987 [18415] 
939987 [18416] â€œWhy do you bring him in all of a sudden?â€
939987 [18417] 
939987 [18418] â€œWhy do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all things are
939987 [18419] made equal. Thatâ€™s the long and short of it.â€
939987 [18420] 
939987 [18421] â€œYou know, I keep thinking of your pistols.â€
939987 [18422] 
939987 [18423] â€œThatâ€™s all foolery, too! Drink, and donâ€™t be fanciful. I love life. Iâ€™ve
939987 [18424] loved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Letâ€™s drink to life, dear
939987 [18425] boy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with myself? Iâ€™m a scoundrel,
939987 [18426] but Iâ€™m satisfied with myself. And yet Iâ€™m tortured by the thought that
939987 [18427] Iâ€™m a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself. I bless the creation. Iâ€™m
939987 [18428] ready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I must kill one
939987 [18429] noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others.... Let
939987 [18430] us drink to life, dear brother. What can be more precious than life?
939987 [18431] Nothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!â€
939987 [18432] 
939987 [18433] â€œLetâ€™s drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.â€
939987 [18434] 
939987 [18435] They drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet he
939987 [18436] was melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy, overwhelming anxiety
939987 [18437] were weighing upon him.
939987 [18438] 
939987 [18439] â€œMisha ... hereâ€™s your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink this
939987 [18440] glass to PhÅ“bus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn....â€
939987 [18441] 
939987 [18442] â€œWhat are you giving it him for?â€ cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.
939987 [18443] 
939987 [18444] â€œYes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!â€
939987 [18445] 
939987 [18446] â€œEâ€”ech!â€
939987 [18447] 
939987 [18448] Misha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.
939987 [18449] 
939987 [18450] â€œHeâ€™ll remember it afterwards,â€ Mitya remarked. â€œWoman, I love woman! What
939987 [18451] is woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad, Pyotr
939987 [18452] Ilyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? â€˜I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas,
939987 [18453] poor Yorick!â€™ Perhaps thatâ€™s me, Yorick? Yes, Iâ€™m Yorick now, and a skull
939987 [18454] afterwards.â€
939987 [18455] 
939987 [18456] Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while.
939987 [18457] 
939987 [18458] â€œWhat dogâ€™s that youâ€™ve got here?â€ he asked the shopman, casually,
939987 [18459] noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.
939987 [18460] 
939987 [18461] â€œIt belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,â€ answered the clerk. â€œShe
939987 [18462] brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her.â€
939987 [18463] 
939987 [18464] â€œI saw one like it ... in the regiment ...â€ murmured Mitya dreamily, â€œonly
939987 [18465] that one had its hind leg broken.... By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted
939987 [18466] to ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?â€
939987 [18467] 
939987 [18468] â€œWhat a question!â€
939987 [18469] 
939987 [18470] â€œOh, I didnâ€™t mean anything. From somebodyâ€™s pocket, you know. I donâ€™t
939987 [18471] mean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do,
939987 [18472] too....â€
939987 [18473] 
939987 [18474] â€œYou go to the devil.â€
939987 [18475] 
939987 [18476] â€œIâ€™m talking of other peopleâ€™s money. Stealing straight out of a pocket?
939987 [18477] Out of a purse, eh?â€
939987 [18478] 
939987 [18479] â€œI stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I took
939987 [18480] it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.â€
939987 [18481] 
939987 [18482] â€œWell, and what happened?â€
939987 [18483] 
939987 [18484] â€œOh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, and
939987 [18485] gave it back.â€
939987 [18486] 
939987 [18487] â€œAnd what then?â€
939987 [18488] 
939987 [18489] â€œNaturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen something?â€
939987 [18490] 
939987 [18491] â€œI have,â€ said Mitya, winking slyly.
939987 [18492] 
939987 [18493] â€œWhat have you stolen?â€ inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.
939987 [18494] 
939987 [18495] â€œI stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and gave
939987 [18496] it back three days after.â€
939987 [18497] 
939987 [18498] As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.
939987 [18499] 
939987 [18500] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch, wonâ€™t you come now?â€ called Andrey from the door of
939987 [18501] the shop.
939987 [18502] 
939987 [18503] â€œAre you ready? Weâ€™ll come!â€ Mitya started. â€œA few more last words
939987 [18504] andâ€”Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some brandy as well!
939987 [18505] That boxâ€ (the one with the pistols) â€œput under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr
939987 [18506] Ilyitch, donâ€™t remember evil against me.â€
939987 [18507] 
939987 [18508] â€œBut youâ€™re coming back to-morrow?â€
939987 [18509] 
939987 [18510] â€œOf course.â€
939987 [18511] 
939987 [18512] â€œWill you settle the little bill now?â€ cried the clerk, springing forward.
939987 [18513] 
939987 [18514] â€œOh, yes, the bill. Of course.â€
939987 [18515] 
939987 [18516] He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out three
939987 [18517] hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of the
939987 [18518] shop. Every one followed him out, bowing and wishing him good luck.
939987 [18519] Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the
939987 [18520] box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise
939987 [18521] he saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him
939987 [18522] with a cry, and plumped down at his feet.
939987 [18523] 
939987 [18524] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, donâ€™t harm my
939987 [18525] mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And donâ€™t murder him, he
939987 [18526] came first, heâ€™s hers! Heâ€™ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. Thatâ€™s why
939987 [18527] heâ€™s come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, donâ€™t take a
939987 [18528] fellow creatureâ€™s life!â€
939987 [18529] 
939987 [18530] â€œTutâ€”tutâ€”tut! Thatâ€™s it, is it? So youâ€™re off there to make trouble!â€
939987 [18531] muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. â€œNow, itâ€™s all clear, as clear as daylight. Dmitri
939987 [18532] Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a
939987 [18533] man,â€ he shouted aloud to Mitya. â€œDo you hear, Dmitri?â€
939987 [18534] 
939987 [18535] â€œThe pistols? Wait a bit, brother, Iâ€™ll throw them into the pool on the
939987 [18536] road,â€ answered Mitya. â€œFenya, get up, donâ€™t kneel to me. Mitya wonâ€™t hurt
939987 [18537] any one, the silly fool wonâ€™t hurt any one again. But I say, Fenya,â€ he
939987 [18538] shouted, after having taken his seat. â€œI hurt you just now, so forgive me
939987 [18539] and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it doesnâ€™t matter if you
939987 [18540] donâ€™t. Itâ€™s all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full
939987 [18541] speed!â€
939987 [18542] 
939987 [18543] Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.
939987 [18544] 
939987 [18545] â€œGood-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...â€
939987 [18546] 
939987 [18547] â€œHeâ€™s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,â€ Pyotr Ilyitch
939987 [18548] thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the cart
939987 [18549] packed with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they would
939987 [18550] deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, he
939987 [18551] turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards.
939987 [18552] 
939987 [18553] â€œHeâ€™s a fool, though heâ€™s a good fellow,â€ he muttered as he went. â€œIâ€™ve
939987 [18554] heard of that officer, Grushenkaâ€™s former flame. Well, if he has turned
939987 [18555] up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! Iâ€™m not his nurse! Let them do
939987 [18556] what they like! Besides, itâ€™ll all come to nothing. Theyâ€™re a set of
939987 [18557] brawlers, thatâ€™s all. Theyâ€™ll drink and fight, fight and make friends
939987 [18558] again. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by â€˜Iâ€™m
939987 [18559] stepping aside, Iâ€™m punishing myself?â€™ Itâ€™ll come to nothing! Heâ€™s shouted
939987 [18560] such phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now heâ€™s not
939987 [18561] drunk. â€˜Drunk in spiritâ€™â€”theyâ€™re fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I
939987 [18562] his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood. With
939987 [18563] whom? I shall find out at the â€˜Metropolis.â€™ And his handkerchief was
939987 [18564] soaked in blood.... Itâ€™s still lying on my floor.... Hang it!â€
939987 [18565] 
939987 [18566] He reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game. The game
939987 [18567] cheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly began telling one of
939987 [18568] his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash
939987 [18569] againâ€”something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again
939987 [18570] to spend it with Grushenka.... This news roused singular interest in his
939987 [18571] listeners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity.
939987 [18572] They left off playing.
939987 [18573] 
939987 [18574] â€œThree thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?â€
939987 [18575] 
939987 [18576] Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakovâ€™s present was received
939987 [18577] with skepticism.
939987 [18578] 
939987 [18579] â€œHasnâ€™t he robbed his old father?â€”thatâ€™s the question.â€
939987 [18580] 
939987 [18581] â€œThree thousand! Thereâ€™s something odd about it.â€
939987 [18582] 
939987 [18583] â€œHe boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him, here.
939987 [18584] And it was three thousand he talked about ...â€
939987 [18585] 
939987 [18586] Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in his
939987 [18587] answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mityaâ€™s face and hands,
939987 [18588] though he had meant to speak of it at first.
939987 [18589] 
939987 [18590] They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away.
939987 [18591] But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for
939987 [18592] billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he had
939987 [18593] intended, he walked out of the tavern. When he reached the market-place he
939987 [18594] stood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that what he
939987 [18595] wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s and find out if anything had
939987 [18596] happened there. â€œOn account of some stupid nonsenseâ€”as itâ€™s sure to turn
939987 [18597] outâ€”am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it,
939987 [18598] is it my business to look after them?â€
939987 [18599] 
939987 [18600] In a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya.
939987 [18601] â€œDamn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,â€ he thought with
939987 [18602] vexation, â€œI should have heard everything.â€ And the desire to speak to
939987 [18603] her, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he was
939987 [18604] half-way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where
939987 [18605] Grushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock
939987 [18606] in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no
939987 [18607] one answered him; every one in the house was asleep.
939987 [18608] 
939987 [18609] â€œAnd I shall be making a fuss!â€ he thought, with a feeling of positive
939987 [18610] discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking
939987 [18611] again with all his might, filling the street with clamor.
939987 [18612] 
939987 [18613] â€œNot coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!â€ he muttered at each
939987 [18614] knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on
939987 [18615] the gate.
939987 [18616] 
939987 [18617] 
939987 [18618] 
939987 [18619] Chapter VI. â€œI Am Coming, Too!â€
939987 [18620] 
939987 [18621] 
939987 [18622] But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more
939987 [18623] than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andreyâ€™s three horses galloped at such a
939987 [18624] pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. The
939987 [18625] swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big
939987 [18626] stars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the very
939987 [18627] hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it
939987 [18628] for ever and ever.
939987 [18629] 
939987 [18630] All was confusion, confusion, in Mityaâ€™s soul, but although many things
939987 [18631] were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning for
939987 [18632] her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time.
939987 [18633] One thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one instant.
939987 [18634] I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt
939987 [18635] not the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprung
939987 [18636] out of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene, he would have
939987 [18637] been jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with
939987 [18638] blood again. But as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no
939987 [18639] hostility even, for the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he
939987 [18640] had not yet seen him.
939987 [18641] 
939987 [18642] â€œHere there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; this was
939987 [18643] her first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she had
939987 [18644] loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What right
939987 [18645] have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is
939987 [18646] over apart from the officerâ€”even if he had not appeared, everything would
939987 [18647] be over ...â€
939987 [18648] 
939987 [18649] These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been
939987 [18650] capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His present
939987 [18651] plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenyaâ€™s first words, it
939987 [18652] had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its
939987 [18653] consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion in
939987 [18654] his soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace.
939987 [18655] There was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him,
939987 [18656] at moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death with
939987 [18657] pen and paper: â€œI punish myself,â€ and the paper was lying there in his
939987 [18658] pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next
939987 [18659] morning, he would meet the first warm ray of â€œgolden-haired PhÅ“bus.â€
939987 [18660] 
939987 [18661] And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behind
939987 [18662] and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought of it sank
939987 [18663] into his heart with despair. There was one moment when he felt an impulse
939987 [18664] to stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his loaded pistol,
939987 [18665] and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn. But that
939987 [18666] moment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on, â€œdevouring space,â€
939987 [18667] and as he drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took
939987 [18668] more and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful
939987 [18669] images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon her, if
939987 [18670] only for a moment, if only from a distance!
939987 [18671] 
939987 [18672] â€œSheâ€™s now with _him_,â€ he thought, â€œnow I shall see what she looks like
939987 [18673] with him, her first love, and thatâ€™s all I want.â€ Never had this woman,
939987 [18674] who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love in his
939987 [18675] breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, a
939987 [18676] feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her! â€œI will
939987 [18677] efface myself!â€ he said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.
939987 [18678] 
939987 [18679] They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and though
939987 [18680] Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter a word,
939987 [18681] either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his three
939987 [18682] lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible
939987 [18683] anxiety:
939987 [18684] 
939987 [18685] â€œAndrey! What if theyâ€™re asleep?â€
939987 [18686] 
939987 [18687] This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him before.
939987 [18688] 
939987 [18689] â€œIt may well be that theyâ€™re gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [18690] 
939987 [18691] Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there ...
939987 [18692] with such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep, perhaps,
939987 [18693] there too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.
939987 [18694] 
939987 [18695] â€œDrive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!â€ he cried, beside himself.
939987 [18696] 
939987 [18697] â€œBut maybe theyâ€™re not in bed!â€ Andrey went on after a pause. â€œTimofey
939987 [18698] said they were a lot of them thereâ€”â€
939987 [18699] 
939987 [18700] â€œAt the station?â€
939987 [18701] 
939987 [18702] â€œNot at the posting-station, but at Plastunovâ€™s, at the inn, where they
939987 [18703] let out horses, too.â€
939987 [18704] 
939987 [18705] â€œI know. So you say there are a lot of them? Howâ€™s that? Who are they?â€
939987 [18706] cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.
939987 [18707] 
939987 [18708] â€œWell, Timofey was saying theyâ€™re all gentlefolk. Two from our townâ€”who
939987 [18709] they are I canâ€™t sayâ€”and there are two others, strangers, maybe more
939987 [18710] besides. I didnâ€™t ask particularly. Theyâ€™ve set to playing cards, so
939987 [18711] Timofey said.â€
939987 [18712] 
939987 [18713] â€œCards?â€
939987 [18714] 
939987 [18715] â€œSo, maybe theyâ€™re not in bed if theyâ€™re at cards. Itâ€™s most likely not
939987 [18716] more than eleven.â€
939987 [18717] 
939987 [18718] â€œQuicker, Andrey! Quicker!â€ Mitya cried again, nervously.
939987 [18719] 
939987 [18720] â€œMay I ask you something, sir?â€ said Andrey, after a pause. â€œOnly Iâ€™m
939987 [18721] afraid of angering you, sir.â€
939987 [18722] 
939987 [18723] â€œWhat is it?â€
939987 [18724] 
939987 [18725] â€œWhy, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to
939987 [18726] harm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sirâ€” Itâ€™s I am
939987 [18727] taking you there ... forgive me, sir, itâ€™s my conscience ... maybe itâ€™s
939987 [18728] stupid of me to speak of itâ€”â€
939987 [18729] 
939987 [18730] Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.
939987 [18731] 
939987 [18732] â€œAre you a driver?â€ he asked frantically.
939987 [18733] 
939987 [18734] â€œYes, sir.â€
939987 [18735] 
939987 [18736] â€œThen you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driver
939987 [18737] who wouldnâ€™t make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush
939987 [18738] people? No, a driver mustnâ€™t run over people. One canâ€™t run over a man.
939987 [18739] One canâ€™t spoil peopleâ€™s lives. And if you have spoilt a lifeâ€”punish
939987 [18740] yourself.... If only youâ€™ve spoilt, if only youâ€™ve ruined any oneâ€™s
939987 [18741] lifeâ€”punish yourself and go away.â€
939987 [18742] 
939987 [18743] These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey was
939987 [18744] surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.
939987 [18745] 
939987 [18746] â€œThatâ€™s right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, youâ€™re quite right, one mustnâ€™t crush
939987 [18747] or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is created
939987 [18748] by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers,
939987 [18749] drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.â€
939987 [18750] 
939987 [18751] â€œTo hell?â€ Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short laugh.
939987 [18752] â€œAndrey, simple soul,â€ he seized him by the shoulders again, â€œtell me,
939987 [18753] will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?â€
939987 [18754] 
939987 [18755] â€œI donâ€™t know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see, sir,
939987 [18756] when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went straight
939987 [18757] down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony.
939987 [18758] And the devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no more
939987 [18759] sinners in hell. And God said to him, then, â€˜Donâ€™t groan, for you shall
939987 [18760] have all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and the
939987 [18761] rich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I
939987 [18762] come again.â€™ Those were His very words ...â€
939987 [18763] 
939987 [18764] â€œA peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!â€
939987 [18765] 
939987 [18766] â€œSo you see, sir, who it is hellâ€™s for,â€ said Andrey, whipping up the left
939987 [18767] horse, â€œbut youâ€™re like a little child ... thatâ€™s how we look on you ...
939987 [18768] and though youâ€™re hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your
939987 [18769] kind heart.â€
939987 [18770] 
939987 [18771] â€œAnd you, do you forgive me, Andrey?â€
939987 [18772] 
939987 [18773] â€œWhat should I forgive you for, sir? Youâ€™ve never done me any harm.â€
939987 [18774] 
939987 [18775] â€œNo, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will you
939987 [18776] forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!â€
939987 [18777] 
939987 [18778] â€œOh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.â€
939987 [18779] 
939987 [18780] But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering to
939987 [18781] himself.
939987 [18782] 
939987 [18783] â€œLord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let me
939987 [18784] pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself,
939987 [18785] do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love
939987 [18786] Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there
939987 [18787] I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to
939987 [18788] the end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of
939987 [18789] Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot
939987 [18790] help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shall
939987 [18791] fall before her and say, â€˜You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell
939987 [18792] and forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!â€™ â€
939987 [18793] 
939987 [18794] â€œMokroe!â€ cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.
939987 [18795] 
939987 [18796] Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of
939987 [18797] buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village of
939987 [18798] Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were
939987 [18799] asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.
939987 [18800] 
939987 [18801] â€œDrive on, Andrey, I come!â€ Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.
939987 [18802] 
939987 [18803] â€œTheyâ€™re not asleep,â€ said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to the
939987 [18804] Plastunovsâ€™ inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The six
939987 [18805] windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.
939987 [18806] 
939987 [18807] â€œTheyâ€™re not asleep,â€ Mitya repeated joyously. â€œQuicker, Andrey! Gallop!
939987 [18808] Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I have
939987 [18809] come. Iâ€™m coming! Iâ€™m coming, too!â€
939987 [18810] 
939987 [18811] Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and
939987 [18812] pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.
939987 [18813] 
939987 [18814] Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed,
939987 [18815] peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.
939987 [18816] 
939987 [18817] â€œTrifon Borissovitch, is that you?â€
939987 [18818] 
939987 [18819] The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushed
939987 [18820] up to the guest with obsequious delight.
939987 [18821] 
939987 [18822] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?â€
939987 [18823] 
939987 [18824] Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height,
939987 [18825] with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising,
939987 [18826] especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of assuming
939987 [18827] the most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that it was to his
939987 [18828] interest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on one
939987 [18829] side, and a full-skirted coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was
939987 [18830] for ever dreaming of improving his position. More than half the peasants
939987 [18831] were in his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.
939987 [18832] From the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which were
939987 [18833] worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shake
939987 [18834] off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of them was
939987 [18835] already a widow and lived in the inn with her two children, his
939987 [18836] grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman. Another of his
939987 [18837] daughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of the
939987 [18838] inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniature
939987 [18839] photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes. The two
939987 [18840] younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting
939987 [18841] tight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when
939987 [18842] they went to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as
939987 [18843] usual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean
939987 [18844] up after lodgers.
939987 [18845] 
939987 [18846] In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch was
939987 [18847] very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering that
939987 [18848] not a month ago he had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not three
939987 [18849] hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his escapade with
939987 [18850] Grushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment
939987 [18851] Mitya drove up to the steps.
939987 [18852] 
939987 [18853] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!â€
939987 [18854] 
939987 [18855] â€œStay, Trifon Borissovitch,â€ began Mitya, â€œfirst and foremost, where is
939987 [18856] she?â€
939987 [18857] 
939987 [18858] â€œAgrafena Alexandrovna?â€ The inn-keeper understood at once, looking
939987 [18859] sharply into Mityaâ€™s face. â€œSheâ€™s here, too ...â€
939987 [18860] 
939987 [18861] â€œWith whom? With whom?â€
939987 [18862] 
939987 [18863] â€œSome strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from his
939987 [18864] speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and thereâ€™s another with
939987 [18865] him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, thereâ€™s no telling. Theyâ€™re
939987 [18866] dressed like civilians.â€
939987 [18867] 
939987 [18868] â€œWell, are they feasting? Have they money?â€
939987 [18869] 
939987 [18870] â€œPoor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [18871] 
939987 [18872] â€œNothing to boast of? And who are the others?â€
939987 [18873] 
939987 [18874] â€œTheyâ€™re two gentlemen from the town.... Theyâ€™ve come back from Tcherny,
939987 [18875] and are putting up here. Oneâ€™s quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.
939987 [18876] MiÃ¼sov, he must be, but Iâ€™ve forgotten his name ... and I expect you know
939987 [18877] the other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. Heâ€™s been on a pilgrimage, so
939987 [18878] he says, to the monastery in the town. Heâ€™s traveling with this young
939987 [18879] relation of Mr. MiÃ¼sov.â€
939987 [18880] 
939987 [18881] â€œIs that all?â€
939987 [18882] 
939987 [18883] â€œYes.â€
939987 [18884] 
939987 [18885] â€œStay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of her?
939987 [18886] How is she?â€
939987 [18887] 
939987 [18888] â€œOh, sheâ€™s only just come. Sheâ€™s sitting with them.â€
939987 [18889] 
939987 [18890] â€œIs she cheerful? Is she laughing?â€
939987 [18891] 
939987 [18892] â€œNo, I think sheâ€™s not laughing much. Sheâ€™s sitting quite dull. Sheâ€™s
939987 [18893] combing the young gentlemanâ€™s hair.â€
939987 [18894] 
939987 [18895] â€œThe Poleâ€”the officer?â€
939987 [18896] 
939987 [18897] â€œHeâ€™s not young, and heâ€™s not an officer, either. Not him, sir. Itâ€™s the
939987 [18898] young gentleman thatâ€™s Mr. MiÃ¼sovâ€™s relation ... Iâ€™ve forgotten his name.â€
939987 [18899] 
939987 [18900] â€œKalganov.â€
939987 [18901] 
939987 [18902] â€œThatâ€™s it, Kalganov!â€
939987 [18903] 
939987 [18904] â€œAll right. Iâ€™ll see for myself. Are they playing cards?â€
939987 [18905] 
939987 [18906] â€œThey have been playing, but theyâ€™ve left off. Theyâ€™ve been drinking tea,
939987 [18907] the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.â€
939987 [18908] 
939987 [18909] â€œStay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, Iâ€™ll see for myself. Now
939987 [18910] answer one more question: are the gypsies here?â€
939987 [18911] 
939987 [18912] â€œYou canâ€™t have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities have
939987 [18913] sent them away. But weâ€™ve Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the
939987 [18914] village, so one might send for them. Theyâ€™d come.â€
939987 [18915] 
939987 [18916] â€œSend for them. Certainly send for them!â€ cried Mitya. â€œAnd you can get
939987 [18917] the girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, and
939987 [18918] Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!â€
939987 [18919] 
939987 [18920] â€œOh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by now
939987 [18921] theyâ€™re asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri
939987 [18922] Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such
939987 [18923] coarseness and rudeness! Whatâ€™s the good of giving a peasant a cigar to
939987 [18924] smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, Iâ€™ll
939987 [18925] get my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. Theyâ€™ve only
939987 [18926] just gone to bed, Iâ€™ll give them a kick and set them singing for you. You
939987 [18927] gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, eâ€”ech!â€
939987 [18928] 
939987 [18929] For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hidden
939987 [18930] half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked up
939987 [18931] a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in his
939987 [18932] clutches.
939987 [18933] 
939987 [18934] â€œTrifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I was
939987 [18935] here. Do you remember?â€
939987 [18936] 
939987 [18937] â€œYou did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left three
939987 [18938] thousand behind you.â€
939987 [18939] 
939987 [18940] â€œWell, Iâ€™ve come to do the same again, do you see?â€
939987 [18941] 
939987 [18942] And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the
939987 [18943] innkeeperâ€™s nose.
939987 [18944] 
939987 [18945] â€œNow, listen and remember. In an hourâ€™s time the wine will arrive,
939987 [18946] savories, pies, and sweetsâ€”bring them all up at once. That box Andrey has
939987 [18947] got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagne
939987 [18948] immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.â€
939987 [18949] 
939987 [18950] He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.
939987 [18951] 
939987 [18952] â€œHere, Andrey, letâ€™s settle. Hereâ€™s fifteen roubles for the drive, and
939987 [18953] fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... Remember
939987 [18954] Karamazov!â€
939987 [18955] 
939987 [18956] â€œIâ€™m afraid, sir,â€ faltered Andrey. â€œGive me five roubles extra, but more
939987 [18957] I wonâ€™t take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish words
939987 [18958] ...â€
939987 [18959] 
939987 [18960] â€œWhat are you afraid of?â€ asked Mitya, scanning him. â€œWell, go to the
939987 [18961] devil, if thatâ€™s it!â€ he cried, flinging him five roubles. â€œNow, Trifon
939987 [18962] Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, so
939987 [18963] that they donâ€™t see me. Where are they? In the blue room?â€
939987 [18964] 
939987 [18965] Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once obediently
939987 [18966] did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went himself into the
939987 [18967] first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, and
939987 [18968] took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in, and put him in a
939987 [18969] corner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the company without being
939987 [18970] seen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he
939987 [18971] saw her, his heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.
939987 [18972] 
939987 [18973] She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her, on
939987 [18974] the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand and
939987 [18975] seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at her, was
939987 [18976] saying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of the
939987 [18977] table, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at something. On
939987 [18978] the sofa sat _he_, and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger.
939987 [18979] The one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had
939987 [18980] an impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was
939987 [18981] apparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger, struck
939987 [18982] Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. He
939987 [18983] caught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put the
939987 [18984] pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked, feeling cold
939987 [18985] all over, straight into the blue room to face the company.
939987 [18986] 
939987 [18987] â€œAie!â€ shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.
939987 [18988] 
939987 [18989] 
939987 [18990] 
939987 [18991] Chapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover
939987 [18992] 
939987 [18993] 
939987 [18994] With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.
939987 [18995] 
939987 [18996] â€œGentlemen,â€ he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering at
939987 [18997] every word, â€œI ... Iâ€™m all right! Donâ€™t be afraid!â€ he exclaimed,
939987 [18998] â€œIâ€”thereâ€™s nothing the matter,â€ he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who had
939987 [18999] shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand tightly.
939987 [19000] â€œI ... Iâ€™m coming, too. Iâ€™m here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with
939987 [19001] you till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this same
939987 [19002] room?â€
939987 [19003] 
939987 [19004] So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting on
939987 [19005] the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and
939987 [19006] observed severely:
939987 [19007] 
939987 [19008] â€œ_Panie_, weâ€™re here in private. There are other rooms.â€
939987 [19009] 
939987 [19010] â€œWhy, itâ€™s you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?â€ answered Kalganov
939987 [19011] suddenly. â€œSit down with us. How are you?â€
939987 [19012] 
939987 [19013] â€œDelighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a
939987 [19014] lot of you.â€ Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out
939987 [19015] his hand across the table.
939987 [19016] 
939987 [19017] â€œAie! How tight you squeeze! Youâ€™ve quite broken my fingers,â€ laughed
939987 [19018] Kalganov.
939987 [19019] 
939987 [19020] â€œHe always squeezes like that, always,â€ Grushenka put in gayly, with a
939987 [19021] timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mityaâ€™s face that he was not
939987 [19022] going to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity and
939987 [19023] still some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him, and
939987 [19024] indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and
939987 [19025] speak like this at such a moment.
939987 [19026] 
939987 [19027] â€œGood evening,â€ Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up to
939987 [19028] him, too.
939987 [19029] 
939987 [19030] â€œGood evening. Youâ€™re here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too!
939987 [19031] Gentlemen, gentlemen, Iâ€”â€ (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe
939987 [19032] again, evidently taking him for the most important person present.) â€œI
939987 [19033] flew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, in
939987 [19034] this very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,
939987 [19035] _panie_,â€ he cried wildly, â€œI flew here and vowedâ€” Oh, donâ€™t be afraid,
939987 [19036] itâ€™s my last night! Letâ€™s drink to our good understanding. Theyâ€™ll bring
939987 [19037] the wine at once.... I brought this with me.â€ (Something made him pull out
939987 [19038] his bundle of notes.) â€œAllow me, _panie_! I want to have music, singing, a
939987 [19039] revel, as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl
939987 [19040] away, and thereâ€™ll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy on
939987 [19041] my last night.â€
939987 [19042] 
939987 [19043] He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, but
939987 [19044] strange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazed
939987 [19045] fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at Grushenka,
939987 [19046] and was in evident perplexity.
939987 [19047] 
939987 [19048] â€œIf my suverin lady is permittingâ€”â€ he was beginning.
939987 [19049] 
939987 [19050] â€œWhat does â€˜suverinâ€™ mean? â€˜Sovereign,â€™ I suppose?â€ interrupted Grushenka.
939987 [19051] â€œI canâ€™t help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what are
939987 [19052] you talking about? Donâ€™t frighten us, please. You wonâ€™t frighten us, will
939987 [19053] you? If you wonâ€™t, I am glad to see you ...â€
939987 [19054] 
939987 [19055] â€œMe, me frighten you?â€ cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. â€œOh, pass me
939987 [19056] by, go your way, I wonâ€™t hinder you!...â€
939987 [19057] 
939987 [19058] And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by
939987 [19059] flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his head
939987 [19060] away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chair
939987 [19061] tight, as though embracing it.
939987 [19062] 
939987 [19063] â€œCome, come, what a fellow you are!â€ cried Grushenka reproachfully.
939987 [19064] â€œThatâ€™s just how he comes to see meâ€”he begins talking, and I canâ€™t make
939987 [19065] out what he means. He cried like that once before, and now heâ€™s crying
939987 [19066] again! Itâ€™s shameful! Why are you crying? _As though you had anything to
939987 [19067] cry for!_â€ she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some
939987 [19068] irritability.
939987 [19069] 
939987 [19070] â€œI ... Iâ€™m not crying.... Well, good evening!â€ He instantly turned round
939987 [19071] in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh, but a
939987 [19072] long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.
939987 [19073] 
939987 [19074] â€œWell, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!â€ Grushenka said
939987 [19075] to him persuasively. â€œIâ€™m very glad youâ€™ve come, very glad, Mitya, do you
939987 [19076] hear, Iâ€™m very glad! I want him to stay here with us,â€ she said
939987 [19077] peremptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words were
939987 [19078] obviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. â€œI wish it, I wish it!
939987 [19079] And if he goes away I shall go, too!â€ she added with flashing eyes.
939987 [19080] 
939987 [19081] â€œWhat my queen commands is law!â€ pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing
939987 [19082] Grushenkaâ€™s hand. â€œI beg you, _panie_, to join our company,â€ he added
939987 [19083] politely, addressing Mitya.
939987 [19084] 
939987 [19085] Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another
939987 [19086] tirade, but the words did not come.
939987 [19087] 
939987 [19088] â€œLetâ€™s drink, _panie_,â€ he blurted out instead of making a speech. Every
939987 [19089] one laughed.
939987 [19090] 
939987 [19091] â€œGood heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!â€ Grushenka exclaimed
939987 [19092] nervously. â€œDo you hear, Mitya,â€ she went on insistently, â€œdonâ€™t prance
939987 [19093] about, but itâ€™s nice youâ€™ve brought the champagne. I want some myself, and
939987 [19094] I canâ€™t bear liqueurs. And best of all, youâ€™ve come yourself. We were
939987 [19095] fearfully dull here.... Youâ€™ve come for a spree again, I suppose? But put
939987 [19096] your money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?â€
939987 [19097] 
939987 [19098] Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle of
939987 [19099] notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed. In
939987 [19100] confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At that
939987 [19101] moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, and
939987 [19102] glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so bewildered
939987 [19103] that he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him and
939987 [19104] poured out the champagne.
939987 [19105] 
939987 [19106] â€œAnother! Another bottle!â€ Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgetting
939987 [19107] to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink to
939987 [19108] their good understanding, he drank off his glass without waiting for any
939987 [19109] one else. His whole countenance suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic
939987 [19110] expression with which he had entered vanished completely, and a look of
939987 [19111] something childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly
939987 [19112] gentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a
939987 [19113] continual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who
939987 [19114] has done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten
939987 [19115] everything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of
939987 [19116] delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his
939987 [19117] chair close up to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two
939987 [19118] Poles, though he had formed no definite conception of them yet.
939987 [19119] 
939987 [19120] The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his Polish
939987 [19121] accent; and, above all, by his pipe. â€œWell, what of it? Itâ€™s a good thing
939987 [19122] heâ€™s smoking a pipe,â€ he reflected. The Poleâ€™s puffy, middle-aged face,
939987 [19123] with its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-looking
939987 [19124] mustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not
939987 [19125] even particularly struck by the Poleâ€™s absurd wig made in Siberia, with
939987 [19126] love-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples. â€œI suppose itâ€™s all
939987 [19127] right since he wears a wig,â€ he went on, musing blissfully. The other,
939987 [19128] younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and
939987 [19129] listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressed
939987 [19130] Mitya by his great height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole on
939987 [19131] the sofa. â€œIf he stood up heâ€™d be six foot three.â€ The thought flitted
939987 [19132] through Mityaâ€™s mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the
939987 [19133] friend of the other, as it were, a â€œbodyguard,â€ and no doubt the big Pole
939987 [19134] was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed
939987 [19135] to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike
939987 [19136] submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.
939987 [19137] 
939987 [19138] Grushenkaâ€™s mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely
939987 [19139] failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart, was that she was
939987 [19140] kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him sit by her. He was
939987 [19141] beside himself with delight, watching her sip her glass of champagne. The
939987 [19142] silence of the company seemed somehow to strike him, however, and he
939987 [19143] looked round at every one with expectant eyes.
939987 [19144] 
939987 [19145] â€œWhy are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why donâ€™t you begin doing
939987 [19146] something?â€ his smiling eyes seemed to ask.
939987 [19147] 
939987 [19148] â€œHe keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,â€ Kalganov began
939987 [19149] suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.
939987 [19150] 
939987 [19151] Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.
939987 [19152] 
939987 [19153] â€œHeâ€™s talking nonsense?â€ he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seeming
939987 [19154] suddenly delighted at somethingâ€”â€œha ha!â€
939987 [19155] 
939987 [19156] â€œYes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry officers
939987 [19157] in the twenties married Polish women. Thatâ€™s awful rot, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [19158] 
939987 [19159] â€œPolish women?â€ repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.
939987 [19160] 
939987 [19161] Kalganov was well aware of Mityaâ€™s attitude to Grushenka, and he guessed
939987 [19162] about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him, perhaps did
939987 [19163] not interest him at all; what he was interested in was Maximov. He had
939987 [19164] come here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn for
939987 [19165] the first time in his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once been
939987 [19166] with some one to see her; but she had not taken to him. But here she
939987 [19167] looked at him very affectionately: before Mityaâ€™s arrival, she had been
939987 [19168] making much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was a
939987 [19169] boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charming
939987 [19170] fair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair face
939987 [19171] looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimes
939987 [19172] even deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although the young man
939987 [19173] sometimes looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed
939987 [19174] of it, even when he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very
939987 [19175] willful, even capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there was
939987 [19176] something fixed and obstinate in his expression. He would look at you and
939987 [19177] listen, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over something
939987 [19178] else. Often he was listless and lazy, at other times he would grow
939987 [19179] excited, sometimes, apparently, over the most trivial matters.
939987 [19180] 
939987 [19181] â€œOnly imagine, Iâ€™ve been taking him about with me for the last four days,â€
939987 [19182] he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally though, without
939987 [19183] the slightest affectation. â€œEver since your brother, do you remember,
939987 [19184] shoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That made me take an
939987 [19185] interest in him at the time, and I took him into the country, but he keeps
939987 [19186] talking such rot Iâ€™m ashamed to be with him. Iâ€™m taking him back.â€
939987 [19187] 
939987 [19188] â€œThe gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,â€
939987 [19189] the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.
939987 [19190] 
939987 [19191] He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended. If
939987 [19192] he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.
939987 [19193] 
939987 [19194] â€œBut I was married to a Polish lady myself,â€ tittered Maximov.
939987 [19195] 
939987 [19196] â€œBut did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.
939987 [19197] Were you a cavalry officer?â€ put in Kalganov at once.
939987 [19198] 
939987 [19199] â€œWas he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!â€ cried Mitya, listening eagerly,
939987 [19200] and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though there were
939987 [19201] no knowing what he might hear from each.
939987 [19202] 
939987 [19203] â€œNo, you see,â€ Maximov turned to him. â€œWhat I mean is that those pretty
939987 [19204] Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when
939987 [19205] one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a
939987 [19206] kitten ... a little white one ... and the _pan_-father and _pan_-mother
939987 [19207] look on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes
939987 [19208] and offers her his hand.... Thatâ€™s how it is ... offers her his hand, he
939987 [19209] he!â€ Maximov ended, tittering.
939987 [19210] 
939987 [19211] â€œThe _pan_ is a _lajdak_!â€ the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and
939987 [19212] crossed one leg over the other. Mityaâ€™s eye was caught by his huge greased
939987 [19213] boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles looked
939987 [19214] rather greasy.
939987 [19215] 
939987 [19216] â€œWell, now itâ€™s _lajdak_! Whatâ€™s he scolding about?â€ said Grushenka,
939987 [19217] suddenly vexed.
939987 [19218] 
939987 [19219] â€œ_Pani_ Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls,
939987 [19220] and not ladies of good birth,â€ the Pole with the pipe observed to
939987 [19221] Grushenka.
939987 [19222] 
939987 [19223] â€œYou can reckon on that,â€ the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.
939987 [19224] 
939987 [19225] â€œWhat next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes it
939987 [19226] cheerful,â€ Grushenka said crossly.
939987 [19227] 
939987 [19228] â€œIâ€™m not hindering them, _pani_,â€ said the Pole in the wig, with a long
939987 [19229] look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe
939987 [19230] again.
939987 [19231] 
939987 [19232] â€œNo, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.â€ Kalganov got excited
939987 [19233] again, as though it were a question of vast import. â€œHeâ€™s never been in
939987 [19234] Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you werenâ€™t married in
939987 [19235] Poland, were you?â€
939987 [19236] 
939987 [19237] â€œNo, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to Russia
939987 [19238] before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and another
939987 [19239] female relation with a grown-up son. He brought her straight from Poland
939987 [19240] and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very nice
939987 [19241] young man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he didnâ€™t marry
939987 [19242] her, because she turned out to be lame.â€
939987 [19243] 
939987 [19244] â€œSo you married a lame woman?â€ cried Kalganov.
939987 [19245] 
939987 [19246] â€œYes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. I
939987 [19247] thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for fun.â€
939987 [19248] 
939987 [19249] â€œSo pleased she was going to marry you!â€ yelled Kalganov, in a ringing,
939987 [19250] childish voice.
939987 [19251] 
939987 [19252] â€œYes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.
939987 [19253] Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening,
939987 [19254] she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. â€˜I once jumped over
939987 [19255] a puddle when I was a child,â€™ she said, â€˜and injured my leg.â€™ He he!â€
939987 [19256] 
939987 [19257] Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on the
939987 [19258] sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.
939987 [19259] 
939987 [19260] â€œDo you know, thatâ€™s the truth, heâ€™s not lying now,â€ exclaimed Kalganov,
939987 [19261] turning to Mitya; â€œand do you know, heâ€™s been married twice; itâ€™s his
939987 [19262] first wife heâ€™s talking about. But his second wife, do you know, ran away,
939987 [19263] and is alive now.â€
939987 [19264] 
939987 [19265] â€œIs it possible?â€ said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an
939987 [19266] expression of the utmost astonishment.
939987 [19267] 
939987 [19268] â€œYes. She did run away. Iâ€™ve had that unpleasant experience,â€ Maximov
939987 [19269] modestly assented, â€œwith a _monsieur_. And what was worse, sheâ€™d had all
939987 [19270] my little property transferred to her beforehand. â€˜Youâ€™re an educated
939987 [19271] man,â€™ she said to me. â€˜You can always get your living.â€™ She settled my
939987 [19272] business with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: â€˜One of your wives
939987 [19273] was lame, but the other was too light-footed.â€™ He he!â€
939987 [19274] 
939987 [19275] â€œListen, listen!â€ cried Kalganov, bubbling over, â€œif heâ€™s telling liesâ€”and
939987 [19276] he often isâ€”heâ€™s only doing it to amuse us all. Thereâ€™s no harm in that,
939987 [19277] is there? You know, I sometimes like him. Heâ€™s awfully low, but itâ€™s
939987 [19278] natural to him, eh? Donâ€™t you think so? Some people are low from
939987 [19279] self-interest, but heâ€™s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he
939987 [19280] was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_
939987 [19281] about him. Do you remember, thereâ€™s a landowner called Maximov in it, whom
939987 [19282] Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, â€˜for inflicting bodily
939987 [19283] injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.â€™ Would
939987 [19284] you believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten!
939987 [19285] Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the
939987 [19286] beginning of the twenties, so that the dates donâ€™t fit. He couldnâ€™t have
939987 [19287] been thrashed then, he couldnâ€™t, could he?â€
939987 [19288] 
939987 [19289] It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his
939987 [19290] excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.
939987 [19291] 
939987 [19292] â€œWell, but if they did thrash him!â€ he cried, laughing.
939987 [19293] 
939987 [19294] â€œItâ€™s not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean isâ€”â€ put in
939987 [19295] Maximov.
939987 [19296] 
939987 [19297] â€œWhat do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didnâ€™t.â€
939987 [19298] 
939987 [19299] â€œWhat oâ€™clock is it, _panie_?â€ the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall
939987 [19300] friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders in
939987 [19301] reply. Neither of them had a watch.
939987 [19302] 
939987 [19303] â€œWhy not talk? Let other people talk. Mustnâ€™t other people talk because
939987 [19304] youâ€™re bored?â€ Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding
939987 [19305] fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mityaâ€™s mind.
939987 [19306] This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.
939987 [19307] 
939987 [19308] â€œ_Pani_, I didnâ€™t oppose it. I didnâ€™t say anything.â€
939987 [19309] 
939987 [19310] â€œAll right then. Come, tell us your story,â€ Grushenka cried to Maximov.
939987 [19311] â€œWhy are you all silent?â€
939987 [19312] 
939987 [19313] â€œThereâ€™s nothing to tell, itâ€™s all so foolish,â€ answered Maximov at once,
939987 [19314] with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. â€œBesides, all thatâ€™s by way
939987 [19315] of allegory in Gogol, for heâ€™s made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryov
939987 [19316] was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, he
939987 [19317] was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he wasnâ€™t an
939987 [19318] Italian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her
939987 [19319] pretty little legs in tights, and she had a little short skirt with
939987 [19320] spangles, and she kept turning round and round, only not for four hours
939987 [19321] but for four minutes only, and she bewitched every one...â€
939987 [19322] 
939987 [19323] â€œBut what were you beaten for?â€ cried Kalganov.
939987 [19324] 
939987 [19325] â€œFor Piron!â€ answered Maximov.
939987 [19326] 
939987 [19327] â€œWhat Piron?â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [19328] 
939987 [19329] â€œThe famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big party
939987 [19330] of us, in a tavern at that very fair. Theyâ€™d invited me, and first of all
939987 [19331] I began quoting epigrams. â€˜Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!â€™ and
939987 [19332] Boileau answers that heâ€™s going to a masquerade, that is to the baths, he
939987 [19333] he! And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another,
939987 [19334] very sarcastic, well known to all educated people:
939987 [19335] 
939987 [19336] 
939987 [19337]     Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!
939987 [19338]     But one grief is weighing on me.
939987 [19339]     You donâ€™t know your way to the sea!
939987 [19340] 
939987 [19341] 
939987 [19342] They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly
939987 [19343] way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I began
939987 [19344] telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not accepted
939987 [19345] into the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:
939987 [19346] 
939987 [19347] 
939987 [19348]     Ci-gÃ®t Piron qui ne fut rien,
939987 [19349]     Pas mÃªme acadÃ©micien.
939987 [19350] 
939987 [19351] 
939987 [19352] They seized me and thrashed me.â€
939987 [19353] 
939987 [19354] â€œBut what for? What for?â€
939987 [19355] 
939987 [19356] â€œFor my education. People can thrash a man for anything,â€ Maximov
939987 [19357] concluded, briefly and sententiously.
939987 [19358] 
939987 [19359] â€œEh, thatâ€™s enough! Thatâ€™s all stupid, I donâ€™t want to listen. I thought
939987 [19360] it would be amusing,â€ Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.
939987 [19361] 
939987 [19362] Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon his
939987 [19363] feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his element,
939987 [19364] began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands behind his back.
939987 [19365] 
939987 [19366] â€œAh, he canâ€™t sit still,â€ said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously.
939987 [19367] Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofa
939987 [19368] was looking at him with an irritable expression.
939987 [19369] 
939987 [19370] â€œ_Panie!_â€ cried Mitya, â€œletâ€™s drink! and the other _pan_, too! Let us
939987 [19371] drink.â€
939987 [19372] 
939987 [19373] In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them with
939987 [19374] champagne.
939987 [19375] 
939987 [19376] â€œTo Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland!â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [19377] 
939987 [19378] â€œI shall be delighted, _panie_,â€ said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity
939987 [19379] and affable condescension, and he took his glass.
939987 [19380] 
939987 [19381] â€œAnd the other _pan_, whatâ€™s his name? Drink, most illustrious, take your
939987 [19382] glass!â€ Mitya urged.
939987 [19383] 
939987 [19384] â€œPan Vrublevsky,â€ put in the Pole on the sofa.
939987 [19385] 
939987 [19386] Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.
939987 [19387] 
939987 [19388] â€œTo Poland, _panovie!_â€ cried Mitya, raising his glass. â€œHurrah!â€
939987 [19389] 
939987 [19390] All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three
939987 [19391] glasses.
939987 [19392] 
939987 [19393] â€œNow to Russia, _panovie_, and let us be brothers!â€
939987 [19394] 
939987 [19395] â€œPour out some for us,â€ said Grushenka; â€œIâ€™ll drink to Russia, too!â€
939987 [19396] 
939987 [19397] â€œSo will I,â€ said Kalganov.
939987 [19398] 
939987 [19399] â€œAnd I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!â€ tittered Maximov.
939987 [19400] 
939987 [19401] â€œAll! All!â€ cried Mitya. â€œTrifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!â€
939987 [19402] 
939987 [19403] The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table.
939987 [19404] Mitya filled the glasses.
939987 [19405] 
939987 [19406] â€œTo Russia! Hurrah!â€ he shouted again. All drank the toast except the
939987 [19407] Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did not
939987 [19408] touch theirs.
939987 [19409] 
939987 [19410] â€œHowâ€™s this, _panovie_?â€ cried Mitya, â€œwonâ€™t you drink it?â€
939987 [19411] 
939987 [19412] Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:
939987 [19413] 
939987 [19414] â€œTo Russia as she was before 1772.â€
939987 [19415] 
939987 [19416] â€œCome, thatâ€™s better!â€ cried the other Pole, and they both emptied their
939987 [19417] glasses at once.
939987 [19418] 
939987 [19419] â€œYouâ€™re fools, you _panovie_,â€ broke suddenly from Mitya.
939987 [19420] 
939987 [19421] â€œ_Panie!_â€ shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a
939987 [19422] couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.
939987 [19423] 
939987 [19424] â€œCan one help loving oneâ€™s own country?â€ he shouted.
939987 [19425] 
939987 [19426] â€œBe silent! Donâ€™t quarrel! I wonâ€™t have any quarreling!â€ cried Grushenka
939987 [19427] imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face glowed, her
939987 [19428] eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just drunk were
939987 [19429] apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.
939987 [19430] 
939987 [19431] â€œ_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, Iâ€™m sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_
939987 [19432] Vrublevsky, Iâ€™m sorry.â€
939987 [19433] 
939987 [19434] â€œHold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!â€ Grushenka scolded
939987 [19435] with angry annoyance.
939987 [19436] 
939987 [19437] Every one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.
939987 [19438] 
939987 [19439] â€œGentlemen, I was the cause of it all,â€ Mitya began again, unable to make
939987 [19440] anything of Grushenkaâ€™s words. â€œCome, why are we sitting here? What shall
939987 [19441] we do ... to amuse ourselves again?â€
939987 [19442] 
939987 [19443] â€œAch, itâ€™s certainly anything but amusing!â€ Kalganov mumbled lazily.
939987 [19444] 
939987 [19445] â€œLetâ€™s play faro again, as we did just now,â€ Maximov tittered suddenly.
939987 [19446] 
939987 [19447] â€œFaro? Splendid!â€ cried Mitya. â€œIf only the _panovie_â€”â€
939987 [19448] 
939987 [19449] â€œItâ€™s lite, _panovie_,â€ the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were
939987 [19450] unwillingly.
939987 [19451] 
939987 [19452] â€œThatâ€™s true,â€ assented Pan Vrublevsky.
939987 [19453] 
939987 [19454] â€œLite? What do you mean by â€˜liteâ€™?â€ asked Grushenka.
939987 [19455] 
939987 [19456] â€œLate, _pani_! â€˜a late hourâ€™ I mean,â€ the Pole on the sofa explained.
939987 [19457] 
939987 [19458] â€œItâ€™s always late with them. They can never do anything!â€ Grushenka almost
939987 [19459] shrieked in her anger. â€œTheyâ€™re dull themselves, so they want others to be
939987 [19460] dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning up
939987 [19461] their noses at me.â€
939987 [19462] 
939987 [19463] â€œMy goddess!â€ cried the Pole on the sofa, â€œI see youâ€™re not well-disposed
939987 [19464] to me, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m gloomy. Iâ€™m ready, _panie_,â€ added he, addressing
939987 [19465] Mitya.
939987 [19466] 
939987 [19467] â€œBegin, _panie_,â€ Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket, and
939987 [19468] laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. â€œI want to lose a lot to
939987 [19469] you. Take your cards. Make the bank.â€
939987 [19470] 
939987 [19471] â€œWeâ€™ll have cards from the landlord, _panie_,â€ said the little Pole,
939987 [19472] gravely and emphatically.
939987 [19473] 
939987 [19474] â€œThatâ€™s much the best way,â€ chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.
939987 [19475] 
939987 [19476] â€œFrom the landlord? Very good, I understand, letâ€™s get them from him.
939987 [19477] Cards!â€ Mitya shouted to the landlord.
939987 [19478] 
939987 [19479] The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that the
939987 [19480] girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would most
939987 [19481] likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived.
939987 [19482] Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders,
939987 [19483] but only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did
939987 [19484] not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told
939987 [19485] them to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the
939987 [19486] toffee and the fondants. â€œAnd vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!â€ he
939987 [19487] cried in haste. â€œI was rude to Andrey!â€
939987 [19488] 
939987 [19489] Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the shoulder.
939987 [19490] 
939987 [19491] â€œGive me five roubles,â€ he whispered to Mitya. â€œIâ€™ll stake something at
939987 [19492] faro, too, he he!â€
939987 [19493] 
939987 [19494] â€œCapital! Splendid! Take ten, here!â€
939987 [19495] 
939987 [19496] Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten
939987 [19497] roubles. â€œAnd if you lose that, come again, come again.â€
939987 [19498] 
939987 [19499] â€œVery good,â€ Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya,
939987 [19500] too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had
939987 [19501] already sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable,
939987 [19502] almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was
939987 [19503] preparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.
939987 [19504] 
939987 [19505] â€œTo your places, gentlemen,â€ cried Pan Vrublevsky.
939987 [19506] 
939987 [19507] â€œNo, Iâ€™m not going to play any more,â€ observed Kalganov, â€œIâ€™ve lost fifty
939987 [19508] roubles to them just now.â€
939987 [19509] 
939987 [19510] â€œThe _pan_ had no luck, perhaps heâ€™ll be lucky this time,â€ the Pole on the
939987 [19511] sofa observed in his direction.
939987 [19512] 
939987 [19513] â€œHow much in the bank? To correspond?â€ asked Mitya.
939987 [19514] 
939987 [19515] â€œThatâ€™s according, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much as
939987 [19516] you will stake.â€
939987 [19517] 
939987 [19518] â€œA million!â€ laughed Mitya.
939987 [19519] 
939987 [19520] â€œThe Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?â€
939987 [19521] 
939987 [19522] â€œWhat Podvysotsky?â€
939987 [19523] 
939987 [19524] â€œIn Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.
939987 [19525] Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank.
939987 [19526] The banker says, â€˜_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or
939987 [19527] must we trust to your honor?â€™ â€˜To my honor, _panie_,â€™ says Podvysotsky.
939987 [19528] â€˜So much the better.â€™ The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. â€˜Take
939987 [19529] it, _panie_,â€™ says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a
939987 [19530] million. â€˜Take it, _panie_, this is your gain.â€™ There was a million in the
939987 [19531] bank. â€˜I didnâ€™t know that,â€™ says Podvysotsky. â€˜_Panie_ Podvysotsky,â€™ said
939987 [19532] the banker, â€˜you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.â€™ Podvysotsky took
939987 [19533] the million.â€
939987 [19534] 
939987 [19535] â€œThatâ€™s not true,â€ said Kalganov.
939987 [19536] 
939987 [19537] â€œ_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesnâ€™t say such things.â€
939987 [19538] 
939987 [19539] â€œAs if a Polish gambler would give away a million!â€ cried Mitya, but
939987 [19540] checked himself at once. â€œForgive me, _panie_, itâ€™s my fault again, he
939987 [19541] would, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You see
939987 [19542] how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.â€
939987 [19543] 
939987 [19544] â€œAnd I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty little
939987 [19545] _panienotchka_, he he!â€ laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, as
939987 [19546] though trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up and crossed
939987 [19547] himself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too.
939987 [19548] 
939987 [19549] â€œA corner!â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [19550] 
939987 [19551] â€œIâ€™ll bet another rouble, a â€˜singleâ€™ stake,â€ Maximov muttered gleefully,
939987 [19552] hugely delighted at having won a rouble.
939987 [19553] 
939987 [19554] â€œLost!â€ shouted Mitya. â€œA â€˜doubleâ€™ on the seven!â€
939987 [19555] 
939987 [19556] The seven too was trumped.
939987 [19557] 
939987 [19558] â€œStop!â€ cried Kalganov suddenly.
939987 [19559] 
939987 [19560] â€œDouble! Double!â€ Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled the
939987 [19561] stake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakes
939987 [19562] kept winning.
939987 [19563] 
939987 [19564] â€œOn the double!â€ shouted Mitya furiously.
939987 [19565] 
939987 [19566] â€œYouâ€™ve lost two hundred, _panie_. Will you stake another hundred?â€ the
939987 [19567] Pole on the sofa inquired.
939987 [19568] 
939987 [19569] â€œWhat? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!â€
939987 [19570] 
939987 [19571] And pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling two
939987 [19572] hundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.
939987 [19573] 
939987 [19574] â€œThatâ€™s enough!â€ he shouted in his ringing voice.
939987 [19575] 
939987 [19576] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ Mitya stared at him.
939987 [19577] 
939987 [19578] â€œThatâ€™s enough! I donâ€™t want you to play any more. Donâ€™t!â€
939987 [19579] 
939987 [19580] â€œWhy?â€
939987 [19581] 
939987 [19582] â€œBecause I donâ€™t. Hang it, come away. Thatâ€™s why. I wonâ€™t let you go on
939987 [19583] playing.â€
939987 [19584] 
939987 [19585] Mitya gazed at him in astonishment.
939987 [19586] 
939987 [19587] â€œGive it up, Mitya. He may be right. Youâ€™ve lost a lot as it is,â€ said
939987 [19588] Grushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose from
939987 [19589] their seats with a deeply offended air.
939987 [19590] 
939987 [19591] â€œAre you joking, _panie_?â€ said the short man, looking severely at
939987 [19592] Kalganov.
939987 [19593] 
939987 [19594] â€œHow dare you!â€ Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.
939987 [19595] 
939987 [19596] â€œDonâ€™t dare to shout like that,â€ cried Grushenka. â€œAh, you turkey-cocks!â€
939987 [19597] 
939987 [19598] Mitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenkaâ€™s face
939987 [19599] suddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed into
939987 [19600] his mindâ€”a strange new thought!
939987 [19601] 
939987 [19602] â€œ_Pani_ Agrippina,â€ the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger,
939987 [19603] when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.
939987 [19604] 
939987 [19605] â€œMost illustrious, two words with you.â€
939987 [19606] 
939987 [19607] â€œWhat do you want?â€
939987 [19608] 
939987 [19609] â€œIn the next room, Iâ€™ve two words to say to you, something pleasant, very
939987 [19610] pleasant. Youâ€™ll be glad to hear it.â€
939987 [19611] 
939987 [19612] The little _pan_ was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He
939987 [19613] agreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.
939987 [19614] 
939987 [19615] â€œThe bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!â€ cried
939987 [19616] Mitya. â€œMarch, _panovie_!â€
939987 [19617] 
939987 [19618] â€œWhere are you going?â€ asked Grushenka, anxiously.
939987 [19619] 
939987 [19620] â€œWeâ€™ll be back in one moment,â€ answered Mitya.
939987 [19621] 
939987 [19622] There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes. His
939987 [19623] face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before.
939987 [19624] 
939987 [19625] He led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was
939987 [19626] assembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the
939987 [19627] right, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two large
939987 [19628] beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candle
939987 [19629] on a small deal table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down to
939987 [19630] this table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside
939987 [19631] them, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but were
939987 [19632] evidently inquisitive.
939987 [19633] 
939987 [19634] â€œWhat can I do for you, _panie_?â€ lisped the little Pole.
939987 [19635] 
939987 [19636] â€œWell, look here, _panie_, I wonâ€™t keep you long. Thereâ€™s money for you,â€
939987 [19637] he pulled out his notes. â€œWould you like three thousand? Take it and go
939987 [19638] your way.â€
939987 [19639] 
939987 [19640] The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.
939987 [19641] 
939987 [19642] â€œThree thousand, _panie_?â€ He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.
939987 [19643] 
939987 [19644] â€œThree, _panovie_, three! Listen, _panie_, I see youâ€™re a sensible man.
939987 [19645] Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with youâ€”dâ€™you
939987 [19646] hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that,
939987 [19647] _panie_, for ever. Hereâ€™s the door, you go out of it. What have you got
939987 [19648] there, a great-coat, a fur coat? Iâ€™ll bring it out to you. Theyâ€™ll get the
939987 [19649] horses out directly, and thenâ€”good-by, _panie_!â€
939987 [19650] 
939987 [19651] Mitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression of
939987 [19652] extraordinary resolution passed over the Poleâ€™s face.
939987 [19653] 
939987 [19654] â€œAnd the money, _panie_?â€
939987 [19655] 
939987 [19656] â€œThe money, _panie_? Five hundred roubles Iâ€™ll give you this moment for
939987 [19657] the journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred
939987 [19658] to-morrow, in the townâ€”I swear on my honor, Iâ€™ll get it, Iâ€™ll get it at
939987 [19659] any cost!â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [19660] 
939987 [19661] The Poles exchanged glances again. The short manâ€™s face looked more
939987 [19662] forbidding.
939987 [19663] 
939987 [19664] â€œSeven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute,
939987 [19665] cash down!â€ Mitya added, feeling something wrong. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter,
939987 [19666] _panie_? Donâ€™t you trust me? I canâ€™t give you the whole three thousand
939987 [19667] straight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to-morrow....
939987 [19668] Besides, I havenâ€™t the three thousand with me. Iâ€™ve got it at home in the
939987 [19669] town,â€ faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. â€œUpon
939987 [19670] my word, the moneyâ€™s there, hidden.â€
939987 [19671] 
939987 [19672] In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in
939987 [19673] the little manâ€™s face.
939987 [19674] 
939987 [19675] â€œWhat next?â€ he asked ironically. â€œFor shame!â€ and he spat on the floor.
939987 [19676] Pan Vrublevsky spat too.
939987 [19677] 
939987 [19678] â€œYou do that, _panie_,â€ said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was
939987 [19679] over, â€œbecause you hope to make more out of Grushenka? Youâ€™re a couple of
939987 [19680] capons, thatâ€™s what you are!â€
939987 [19681] 
939987 [19682] â€œThis is a mortal insult!â€ The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he
939987 [19683] went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word.
939987 [19684] Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and
939987 [19685] crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the _pan_ would at
939987 [19686] once raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the room
939987 [19687] and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.
939987 [19688] 
939987 [19689] â€œ_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!â€ he exclaimed. But
939987 [19690] Grushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her in
939987 [19691] the tenderest spot.
939987 [19692] 
939987 [19693] â€œSpeak Russian! Speak Russian!â€ she cried, â€œnot another word of Polish!
939987 [19694] You used to talk Russian. You canâ€™t have forgotten it in five years.â€
939987 [19695] 
939987 [19696] She was red with passion.
939987 [19697] 
939987 [19698] â€œ_Pani_ Agrippinaâ€”â€
939987 [19699] 
939987 [19700] â€œMy nameâ€™s Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I wonâ€™t listen!â€
939987 [19701] 
939987 [19702] The Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered
939987 [19703] himself in broken Russian:
939987 [19704] 
939987 [19705] â€œ_Pani_ Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forget
939987 [19706] all that has happened till to-dayâ€”â€
939987 [19707] 
939987 [19708] â€œForgive? Came here to forgive me?â€ Grushenka cut him short, jumping up
939987 [19709] from her seat.
939987 [19710] 
939987 [19711] â€œJust so, _pani_, Iâ€™m not pusillanimous, Iâ€™m magnanimous. But I was
939987 [19712] astounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in
939987 [19713] the other room to depart. I spat in the _panâ€™s_ face.â€
939987 [19714] 
939987 [19715] â€œWhat? He offered you money for me?â€ cried Grushenka, hysterically. â€œIs it
939987 [19716] true, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?â€
939987 [19717] 
939987 [19718] â€œ_Panie, panie!_â€ yelled Mitya, â€œsheâ€™s pure and shining, and I have never
939987 [19719] been her lover! Thatâ€™s a lie....â€
939987 [19720] 
939987 [19721] â€œHow dare you defend me to him?â€ shrieked Grushenka. â€œIt wasnâ€™t virtue
939987 [19722] kept me pure, and it wasnâ€™t that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might
939987 [19723] hold up my head when I met him, and tell him heâ€™s a scoundrel. And he did
939987 [19724] actually refuse the money?â€
939987 [19725] 
939987 [19726] â€œHe took it! He took it!â€ cried Mitya; â€œonly he wanted to get the whole
939987 [19727] three thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred straight
939987 [19728] off.â€
939987 [19729] 
939987 [19730] â€œI see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!â€
939987 [19731] 
939987 [19732] â€œ_Pani_ Agrippina!â€ cried the little Pole. â€œIâ€™mâ€”a knight, Iâ€™mâ€”a nobleman,
939987 [19733] and not a _lajdak_. I came here to make you my wife and I find you a
939987 [19734] different woman, perverse and shameless.â€
939987 [19735] 
939987 [19736] â€œOh, go back where you came from! Iâ€™ll tell them to turn you out and
939987 [19737] youâ€™ll be turned out,â€ cried Grushenka, furious. â€œIâ€™ve been a fool, a
939987 [19738] fool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasnâ€™t for his sake,
939987 [19739] it was my anger made me miserable. And this isnâ€™t he at all! Was he like
939987 [19740] this? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He was a
939987 [19741] falcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to me.... And Iâ€™ve
939987 [19742] been crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!â€
939987 [19743] 
939987 [19744] She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At that
939987 [19745] instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the leftâ€”a
939987 [19746] rollicking dance song.
939987 [19747] 
939987 [19748] â€œA regular Sodom!â€ Vrublevsky roared suddenly. â€œLandlord, send the
939987 [19749] shameless hussies away!â€
939987 [19750] 
939987 [19751] The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at
939987 [19752] the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling, at
939987 [19753] once entered the room.
939987 [19754] 
939987 [19755] â€œWhat are you shouting for? Dâ€™you want to split your throat?â€ he said,
939987 [19756] addressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.
939987 [19757] 
939987 [19758] â€œAnimal!â€ bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.
939987 [19759] 
939987 [19760] â€œAnimal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave you
939987 [19761] a pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send you to
939987 [19762] Siberia for playing with false cards, dâ€™you know that, for itâ€™s just the
939987 [19763] same as false banknotes....â€
939987 [19764] 
939987 [19765] And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and
939987 [19766] the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.
939987 [19767] 
939987 [19768] â€œHereâ€™s my pack unopened!â€
939987 [19769] 
939987 [19770] He held it up and showed it to all in the room. â€œFrom where I stood I saw
939987 [19771] him slip my pack away, and put his in place of itâ€”youâ€™re a cheat and not a
939987 [19772] gentleman!â€
939987 [19773] 
939987 [19774] â€œAnd I twice saw the _pan_ change a card!â€ cried Kalganov.
939987 [19775] 
939987 [19776] â€œHow shameful! How shameful!â€ exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, and
939987 [19777] blushing for genuine shame. â€œGood Lord, heâ€™s come to that!â€
939987 [19778] 
939987 [19779] â€œI thought so, too!â€ said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words,
939987 [19780] Vrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at
939987 [19781] Grushenka, shouting:
939987 [19782] 
939987 [19783] â€œYou low harlot!â€
939987 [19784] 
939987 [19785] Mitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in the
939987 [19786] air, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right, from
939987 [19787] which they had just come.
939987 [19788] 
939987 [19789] â€œIâ€™ve laid him on the floor, there,â€ he announced, returning at once,
939987 [19790] gasping with excitement. â€œHeâ€™s struggling, the scoundrel! But he wonâ€™t
939987 [19791] come back, no fear of that!...â€
939987 [19792] 
939987 [19793] He closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called
939987 [19794] out to the little Pole:
939987 [19795] 
939987 [19796] â€œMost illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?â€
939987 [19797] 
939987 [19798] â€œMy dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ said Trifon Borissovitch, â€œmake them give
939987 [19799] you back the money you lost. Itâ€™s as good as stolen from you.â€
939987 [19800] 
939987 [19801] â€œI donâ€™t want my fifty roubles back,â€ Kalganov declared suddenly.
939987 [19802] 
939987 [19803] â€œI donâ€™t want my two hundred, either,â€ cried Mitya, â€œI wouldnâ€™t take it
939987 [19804] for anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.â€
939987 [19805] 
939987 [19806] â€œBravo, Mitya! Youâ€™re a trump, Mitya!â€ cried Grushenka, and there was a
939987 [19807] note of fierce anger in the exclamation.
939987 [19808] 
939987 [19809] The little _pan_, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity, was
939987 [19810] making for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressing
939987 [19811] Grushenka:
939987 [19812] 
939987 [19813] â€œ_Pani_, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.â€
939987 [19814] 
939987 [19815] And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This was
939987 [19816] a man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after all
939987 [19817] that had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya slammed
939987 [19818] the door after him.
939987 [19819] 
939987 [19820] â€œLock it,â€ said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they had
939987 [19821] locked it from within.
939987 [19822] 
939987 [19823] â€œThatâ€™s capital!â€ exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. â€œServe them right!â€
939987 [19824] 
939987 [19825] 
939987 [19826] 
939987 [19827] Chapter VIII. Delirium
939987 [19828] 
939987 [19829] 
939987 [19830] What followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.
939987 [19831] Grushenka was the first to call for wine.
939987 [19832] 
939987 [19833] â€œI want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before. Do you
939987 [19834] remember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!â€
939987 [19835] 
939987 [19836] Mitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was at
939987 [19837] hand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.
939987 [19838] 
939987 [19839] â€œGo and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, â€˜let the stove
939987 [19840] and cottage danceâ€™; as we had it last time,â€ she kept exclaiming. She was
939987 [19841] tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her. The chorus were in
939987 [19842] the next room. The room in which they had been sitting till that moment
939987 [19843] was too small, and was divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which was
939987 [19844] a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows.
939987 [19845] In the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herself
939987 [19846] just at the door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had sat in the same
939987 [19847] place to watch the dancing and singing â€œthe time before,â€ when they had
939987 [19848] made merry there. All the girls who had come had been there then; the
939987 [19849] Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and at last the long
939987 [19850] expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions.
939987 [19851] 
939987 [19852] Mitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the room to
939987 [19853] look on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep and
939987 [19854] attracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they had
939987 [19855] enjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting and
939987 [19856] embracing every one he knew. He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for
939987 [19857] every one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for the
939987 [19858] champagne. The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mitya
939987 [19859] had chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars
939987 [19860] should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to
939987 [19861] help himself.
939987 [19862] 
939987 [19863] An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his natural
939987 [19864] element, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits rose. If the
939987 [19865] peasants had asked him for money at that moment, he would have pulled out
939987 [19866] his notes and given them away right and left. This was probably why the
939987 [19867] landlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him.
939987 [19868] He seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but he
939987 [19869] drank little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on
939987 [19870] Mityaâ€™s interests after his own fashion. He intervened in the nick of
939987 [19871] time, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away â€œcigars
939987 [19872] and Rhine wine,â€ and, above all, money to the peasants as he had done
939987 [19873] before. He was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur,
939987 [19874] and eating sweets.
939987 [19875] 
939987 [19876] â€œTheyâ€™re a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™d give them a
939987 [19877] kick, every one of them, and theyâ€™d take it as an honorâ€”thatâ€™s all theyâ€™re
939987 [19878] worth!â€
939987 [19879] 
939987 [19880] Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him. â€œI
939987 [19881] was rude to him just now,â€ he repeated with a sinking, softened voice.
939987 [19882] Kalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for the girlsâ€™
939987 [19883] singing; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became
939987 [19884] extraordinarily lively, strolling about the room, laughing and praising
939987 [19885] the music and the songs, admiring every one and everything. Maximov,
939987 [19886] blissfully drunk, never left his side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to
939987 [19887] get drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to Mitya:
939987 [19888] 
939987 [19889] â€œWhat a dear, charming boy he is!â€
939987 [19890] 
939987 [19891] And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were his
939987 [19892] hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to refrain
939987 [19893] from speaking. But she looked at him from time to time with caressing and
939987 [19894] passionate eyes. At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him
939987 [19895] vigorously to her. She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the
939987 [19896] door.
939987 [19897] 
939987 [19898] â€œHow was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!... I was
939987 [19899] frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you really
939987 [19900] want to?â€
939987 [19901] 
939987 [19902] â€œI didnâ€™t want to spoil your happiness!â€ Mitya faltered blissfully. But
939987 [19903] she did not need his answer.
939987 [19904] 
939987 [19905] â€œWell, go and enjoy yourself ...â€ she sent him away once more. â€œDonâ€™t cry,
939987 [19906] Iâ€™ll call you back again.â€
939987 [19907] 
939987 [19908] He would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked at the
939987 [19909] dancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in another
939987 [19910] quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run
939987 [19911] back to her.
939987 [19912] 
939987 [19913] â€œCome, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my coming
939987 [19914] here yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?â€
939987 [19915] 
939987 [19916] And Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,
939987 [19917] feverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.
939987 [19918] 
939987 [19919] â€œWhat are you frowning at?â€ she asked.
939987 [19920] 
939987 [19921] â€œNothing.... I left a man ill there. Iâ€™d give ten years of my life for him
939987 [19922] to get well, to know he was all right!â€
939987 [19923] 
939987 [19924] â€œWell, never mind him, if heâ€™s ill. So you meant to shoot yourself
939987 [19925] to-morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows as
939987 [19926] you,â€ she lisped, with a rather halting tongue. â€œSo you would go any
939987 [19927] length for me, eh? Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow, you
939987 [19928] stupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow I may have something to say to
939987 [19929] you.... I wonâ€™t say it to-day, but to-morrow. Youâ€™d like it to be to-day?
939987 [19930] No, I donâ€™t want to to-day. Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.â€
939987 [19931] 
939987 [19932] Once, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.
939987 [19933] 
939987 [19934] â€œWhy are you sad? I see youâ€™re sad.... Yes, I see it,â€ she added, looking
939987 [19935] intently into his eyes. â€œThough you keep kissing the peasants and
939987 [19936] shouting, I see something. No, be merry. Iâ€™m merry; you be merry, too....
939987 [19937] I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep,
939987 [19938] poor dear, heâ€™s drunk.â€
939987 [19939] 
939987 [19940] She meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for a
939987 [19941] moment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink; he
939987 [19942] felt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, â€œbored.â€ He was intensely
939987 [19943] depressed by the girlsâ€™ songs, which, as the drinking went on, gradually
939987 [19944] became coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad. Two girls
939987 [19945] dressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in
939987 [19946] her hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to â€œshow them.â€
939987 [19947] 
939987 [19948] â€œLook alive, Marya, or youâ€™ll get the stick!â€
939987 [19949] 
939987 [19950] The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amid
939987 [19951] roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women.
939987 [19952] 
939987 [19953] â€œWell, let them! Let them!â€ said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstatic
939987 [19954] expression on her face. â€œWhen they do get a day to enjoy themselves, why
939987 [19955] shouldnâ€™t folks be happy?â€
939987 [19956] 
939987 [19957] Kalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.
939987 [19958] 
939987 [19959] â€œItâ€™s swinish, all this peasant foolery,â€ he murmured, moving away; â€œitâ€™s
939987 [19960] the game they play when itâ€™s light all night in summer.â€
939987 [19961] 
939987 [19962] He particularly disliked one â€œnewâ€ song to a jaunty dance-tune. It
939987 [19963] described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to see
939987 [19964] whether they would love him:
939987 [19965] 
939987 [19966] 
939987 [19967]     The master came to try the girls:
939987 [19968]     Would they love him, would they not?
939987 [19969] 
939987 [19970] 
939987 [19971] But the girls could not love the master:
939987 [19972] 
939987 [19973] 
939987 [19974]     He would beat me cruelly
939987 [19975]     And such love wonâ€™t do for me.
939987 [19976] 
939987 [19977] 
939987 [19978] Then a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:
939987 [19979] 
939987 [19980] 
939987 [19981]     The gypsy came to try the girls:
939987 [19982]     Would they love him, would they not?
939987 [19983] 
939987 [19984] 
939987 [19985] But they couldnâ€™t love the gypsy either:
939987 [19986] 
939987 [19987] 
939987 [19988]     He would be a thief, I fear,
939987 [19989]     And would cause me many a tear.
939987 [19990] 
939987 [19991] 
939987 [19992] And many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier:
939987 [19993] 
939987 [19994] 
939987 [19995]     The soldier came to try the girls:
939987 [19996]     Would they love him, would they not?
939987 [19997] 
939987 [19998] 
939987 [19999] But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung
939987 [20000] with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The song
939987 [20001] ends with a merchant:
939987 [20002] 
939987 [20003] 
939987 [20004]     The merchant came to try the girls:
939987 [20005]     Would they love him, would they not?
939987 [20006] 
939987 [20007] 
939987 [20008] And it appears that he wins their love because:
939987 [20009] 
939987 [20010] 
939987 [20011]     The merchant will make gold for me
939987 [20012]     And his queen Iâ€™ll gladly be.
939987 [20013] 
939987 [20014] 
939987 [20015] Kalvanov was positively indignant.
939987 [20016] 
939987 [20017] â€œThatâ€™s just a song of yesterday,â€ he said aloud. â€œWho writes such things
939987 [20018] for them? They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to
939987 [20019] try his luck with the girls; theyâ€™d have carried all before them.â€
939987 [20020] 
939987 [20021] And, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on the
939987 [20022] spot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.
939987 [20023] His pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on the sofa
939987 [20024] cushion.
939987 [20025] 
939987 [20026] â€œLook how pretty he is,â€ said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him. â€œI was
939987 [20027] combing his hair just now; his hairâ€™s like flax, and so thick....â€
939987 [20028] 
939987 [20029] And, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganov
939987 [20030] instantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with the most
939987 [20031] anxious air inquired where was Maximov?
939987 [20032] 
939987 [20033] â€œSo thatâ€™s who it is you want.â€ Grushenka laughed. â€œStay with me a minute.
939987 [20034] Mitya, run and find his Maximov.â€
939987 [20035] 
939987 [20036] Maximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, only
939987 [20037] running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur. He
939987 [20038] had drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was red, and his nose was
939987 [20039] crimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet. He ran up and announced
939987 [20040] that he was going to dance the â€œsabotiÃ¨re.â€
939987 [20041] 
939987 [20042] â€œThey taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I was
939987 [20043] little....â€
939987 [20044] 
939987 [20045] â€œGo, go with him, Mitya, and Iâ€™ll watch from here how he dances,â€ said
939987 [20046] Grushenka.
939987 [20047] 
939987 [20048] â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m coming to look on, too,â€ exclaimed Kalganov, brushing aside
939987 [20049] in the most naÃ¯ve way Grushenkaâ€™s offer to sit with him. They all went to
939987 [20050] look on. Maximov danced his dance. But it roused no great admiration in
939987 [20051] any one but Mitya. It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping,
939987 [20052] kicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole
939987 [20053] of his foot. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.
939987 [20054] 
939987 [20055] â€œThanks. Youâ€™re tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would you
939987 [20056] like some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?â€
939987 [20057] 
939987 [20058] â€œA cigarette.â€
939987 [20059] 
939987 [20060] â€œDonâ€™t you want a drink?â€
939987 [20061] 
939987 [20062] â€œIâ€™ll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?â€
939987 [20063] 
939987 [20064] â€œYes, thereâ€™s a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my dear
939987 [20065] soul!â€
939987 [20066] 
939987 [20067] â€œI like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!â€
939987 [20068] 
939987 [20069] â€œNo, brother, weâ€™ve none of that special sort.â€
939987 [20070] 
939987 [20071] â€œI say,â€ the old man bent down to whisper in Mityaâ€™s ear. â€œThat girl
939987 [20072] there, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to help me make
939987 [20073] friends with her?â€
939987 [20074] 
939987 [20075] â€œSo thatâ€™s what youâ€™re after! No, brother, that wonâ€™t do!â€
939987 [20076] 
939987 [20077] â€œIâ€™d do no harm to any one,â€ Maximov muttered disconsolately.
939987 [20078] 
939987 [20079] â€œOh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, you
939987 [20080] know, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be merry,
939987 [20081] meanwhile. Donâ€™t you want money?â€
939987 [20082] 
939987 [20083] â€œLater on, perhaps,â€ smiled Maximov.
939987 [20084] 
939987 [20085] â€œAll right, all right....â€
939987 [20086] 
939987 [20087] Mityaâ€™s head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony which ran
939987 [20088] round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the courtyard. The
939987 [20089] fresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark corner, and suddenly
939987 [20090] clutched his head in both hands. His scattered thoughts came together; his
939987 [20091] sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind. A
939987 [20092] fearful and terrible light! â€œIf Iâ€™m to shoot myself, why not now?â€ passed
939987 [20093] through his mind. â€œWhy not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here,
939987 [20094] in this dark dirty corner, make an end?â€ Almost a minute he stood,
939987 [20095] undecided. A few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he was
939987 [20096] pursued by disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that blood, that
939987 [20097] blood!... But yet it was easier for him then. Then everything was over: he
939987 [20098] had lost her, given her up. She was gone, for himâ€”oh, then his death
939987 [20099] sentence had been easier for him; at least it had seemed necessary,
939987 [20100] inevitable, for what had he to stay on earth for?
939987 [20101] 
939987 [20102] But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at least was
939987 [20103] at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had vanished,
939987 [20104] leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had turned into something so small,
939987 [20105] so comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in. It would
939987 [20106] never return. She was ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom she
939987 [20107] loved. Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go on
939987 [20108] living, he could not; oh, damnation! â€œO God! restore to life the man I
939987 [20109] knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me! Lord, thou
939987 [20110] hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the old
939987 [20111] manâ€™s alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away. I
939987 [20112] would restore the stolen money. Iâ€™d give it back; Iâ€™d get it somehow....
939987 [20113] No trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever! But no,
939987 [20114] no; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!â€
939987 [20115] 
939987 [20116] Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped up and
939987 [20117] ran back to the roomâ€”to her, to her, his queen for ever! Was not one
939987 [20118] moment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies of
939987 [20119] disgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart. â€œTo her, to her alone,
939987 [20120] to see her, to hear her, to think of nothing, to forget everything, if
939987 [20121] only for that night, for an hour, for a moment!â€ Just as he turned from
939987 [20122] the balcony into the passage, he came upon the landlord, Trifon
939987 [20123] Borissovitch. He thought he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had
939987 [20124] come to find him.
939987 [20125] 
939987 [20126] â€œWhat is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?â€
939987 [20127] 
939987 [20128] â€œNo, sir.â€ The landlord seemed disconcerted. â€œWhy should I be looking for
939987 [20129] you? Where have you been?â€
939987 [20130] 
939987 [20131] â€œWhy do you look so glum? Youâ€™re not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you shall
939987 [20132] soon get to bed.... Whatâ€™s the time?â€
939987 [20133] 
939987 [20134] â€œItâ€™ll be three oâ€™clock. Past three, it must be.â€
939987 [20135] 
939987 [20136] â€œWeâ€™ll leave off soon. Weâ€™ll leave off.â€
939987 [20137] 
939987 [20138] â€œDonâ€™t mention it; it doesnâ€™t matter. Keep it up as long as you like....â€
939987 [20139] 
939987 [20140] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with him?â€ Mitya wondered for an instant, and he ran
939987 [20141] back to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was not there. She
939987 [20142] was not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov asleep on
939987 [20143] the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtainâ€”she was there. She was sitting
939987 [20144] in the corner, on a trunk. Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bed
939987 [20145] close by, she was crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs
939987 [20146] that she might not be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and
939987 [20147] when he ran to her, she grasped his hand tightly.
939987 [20148] 
939987 [20149] â€œMitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these five
939987 [20150] years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him, him!
939987 [20151] Itâ€™s a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was only
939987 [20152] seventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to me....
939987 [20153] Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, itâ€™s not the
939987 [20154] same man. Even his face is not the same; heâ€™s different altogether. I
939987 [20155] shouldnâ€™t have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was
939987 [20156] thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we should
939987 [20157] look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as
939987 [20158] though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to me like
939987 [20159] a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so solemnly that I was
939987 [20160] struck dumb. I couldnâ€™t get a word in. At first I thought he was ashamed
939987 [20161] to talk before his great big Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why
939987 [20162] I couldnâ€™t say a word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined
939987 [20163] him; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed him
939987 [20164] like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, Iâ€™m ashamed, Iâ€™m ashamed
939987 [20165] for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!â€
939987 [20166] 
939987 [20167] And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mityaâ€™s hand and did
939987 [20168] not let it go.
939987 [20169] 
939987 [20170] â€œMitya, darling, stay, donâ€™t go away. I want to say one word to you,â€ she
939987 [20171] whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. â€œListen, tell me who it is
939987 [20172] I love? I love one man here. Who is that man? Thatâ€™s what you must tell
939987 [20173] me.â€
939987 [20174] 
939987 [20175] A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and her eyes
939987 [20176] shone in the half darkness.
939987 [20177] 
939987 [20178] â€œA falcon flew in, and my heart sank. â€˜Fool! thatâ€™s the man you love!â€™
939987 [20179] That was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in and all grew
939987 [20180] bright. Whatâ€™s he afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened; you
939987 [20181] couldnâ€™t speak. Itâ€™s not them heâ€™s afraid ofâ€”could you be frightened of
939987 [20182] any one? Itâ€™s me heâ€™s afraid of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you,
939987 [20183] you little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the window that Iâ€™d
939987 [20184] loved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another.
939987 [20185] Mitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one
939987 [20186] after you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love
939987 [20187] me? Do you love me?â€ She jumped up and held him with both hands on his
939987 [20188] shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her eyes, at her face, at
939987 [20189] her smile, and suddenly clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed her
939987 [20190] passionately.
939987 [20191] 
939987 [20192] â€œYou will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite I
939987 [20193] tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of his
939987 [20194] mind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the
939987 [20195] wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank â€˜to my
939987 [20196] vile heart.â€™ Mitya, my falcon, why donâ€™t you kiss me? He kissed me once,
939987 [20197] and now he draws back and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me,
939987 [20198] kiss me hard, thatâ€™s right. If you love, well, then, love! Iâ€™ll be your
939987 [20199] slave now, your slave for the rest of my life. Itâ€™s sweet to be a slave.
939987 [20200] Kiss me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I do
939987 [20201] deserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I wonâ€™t have that....â€ she
939987 [20202] suddenly thrust him away. â€œGo along, Mitya, Iâ€™ll come and have some wine,
939987 [20203] I want to be drunk, Iâ€™m going to get drunk and dance; I must, I must!â€ She
939987 [20204] tore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain. Mitya
939987 [20205] followed like a drunken man.
939987 [20206] 
939987 [20207] â€œYes, come what mayâ€”whatever may happen now, for one minute Iâ€™d give the
939987 [20208] whole world,â€ he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole glass
939987 [20209] of champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She sat down in
939987 [20210] the same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her face. Her cheeks
939987 [20211] were glowing, her lips were burning, her flashing eyes were moist; there
939987 [20212] was passionate appeal in her eyes. Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart
939987 [20213] and went up to her.
939987 [20214] 
939987 [20215] â€œDid you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?â€ she said
939987 [20216] thickly. â€œIâ€™m drunk now, thatâ€™s what it is.... And arenâ€™t you drunk? And
939987 [20217] why isnâ€™t Mitya drinking? Why donâ€™t you drink, Mitya? Iâ€™m drunk, and you
939987 [20218] donâ€™t drink....â€
939987 [20219] 
939987 [20220] â€œI am drunk! Iâ€™m drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now Iâ€™ll be
939987 [20221] drunk with wine, too.â€
939987 [20222] 
939987 [20223] He drank off another glass, andâ€”he thought it strange himselfâ€”that glass
939987 [20224] made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although till that
939987 [20225] moment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that moment
939987 [20226] everything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He walked,
939987 [20227] laughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was doing. Only one
939987 [20228] persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, â€œlike a red-hot
939987 [20229] coal in his heart,â€ he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her,
939987 [20230] gazed at her, listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling
939987 [20231] every one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When
939987 [20232] the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross
939987 [20233] over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amused
939987 [20234] by the â€œlittle old man,â€ as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to
939987 [20235] kiss her hands, â€œeach little finger,â€ and finally he danced another dance
939987 [20236] to an old song, which he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to the
939987 [20237] refrain:
939987 [20238] 
939987 [20239] 
939987 [20240]     The little pig saysâ€”umph! umph! umph!
939987 [20241]     The little calf saysâ€”moo, moo, moo,
939987 [20242]     The little duck saysâ€”quack, quack, quack,
939987 [20243]     The little goose saysâ€”ga, ga, ga.
939987 [20244]     The hen goes strutting through the porch;
939987 [20245]     Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, sheâ€™ll say,
939987 [20246]     Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, sheâ€™ll say!
939987 [20247] 
939987 [20248] 
939987 [20249] â€œGive him something, Mitya,â€ said Grushenka. â€œGive him a present, heâ€™s
939987 [20250] poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I shall
939987 [20251] go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something to
939987 [20252] me to-day that I shall remember all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let us
939987 [20253] dance. To-morrow to the nunnery, but to-day weâ€™ll dance. I want to play
939987 [20254] to-day, good people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God,
939987 [20255] Iâ€™d forgive every one: â€˜My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive
939987 [20256] you.â€™ Iâ€™m going to beg forgiveness: â€˜Forgive me, good people, a silly
939987 [20257] wench.â€™ Iâ€™m a beast, thatâ€™s what I am. But I want to pray. I gave a little
939987 [20258] onion. Wicked as Iâ€™ve been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them dance, donâ€™t
939987 [20259] stop them. Every one in the world is good. Every oneâ€”even the worst of
939987 [20260] them. The worldâ€™s a nice place. Though weâ€™re bad the worldâ€™s all right.
939987 [20261] Weâ€™re good and bad, good and bad.... Come, tell me, Iâ€™ve something to ask
939987 [20262] you: come here every one, and Iâ€™ll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I
939987 [20263] am good. Iâ€™m very good.... Come, why am I so good?â€
939987 [20264] 
939987 [20265] So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last she
939987 [20266] announced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her chair,
939987 [20267] staggering. â€œMitya, donâ€™t give me any more wineâ€”if I ask you, donâ€™t give
939987 [20268] it to me. Wine doesnâ€™t give peace. Everythingâ€™s going round, the stove,
939987 [20269] and everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance ... let
939987 [20270] them see how beautifully I dance....â€
939987 [20271] 
939987 [20272] She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her
939987 [20273] pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave it in the
939987 [20274] dance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to break
939987 [20275] into a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov, hearing that Grushenka
939987 [20276] wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front of
939987 [20277] her, humming:
939987 [20278] 
939987 [20279] 
939987 [20280]     With legs so slim and sides so trim
939987 [20281]     And its little tail curled tight.
939987 [20282] 
939987 [20283] 
939987 [20284] But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.
939987 [20285] 
939987 [20286] â€œSh-h! Mitya, why donâ€™t they come? Let every one come ... to look on. Call
939987 [20287] them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in? Tell them
939987 [20288] Iâ€™m going to dance. Let them look on, too....â€
939987 [20289] 
939987 [20290] Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began knocking
939987 [20291] to the Poles with his fist.
939987 [20292] 
939987 [20293] â€œHi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, sheâ€™s going to dance. She calls you.â€
939987 [20294] 
939987 [20295] â€œ_Lajdak!_â€ one of the Poles shouted in reply.
939987 [20296] 
939987 [20297] â€œYouâ€™re a _lajdak_ yourself! Youâ€™re a little scoundrel, thatâ€™s what you
939987 [20298] are.â€
939987 [20299] 
939987 [20300] â€œLeave off laughing at Poland,â€ said Kalganov sententiously. He too was
939987 [20301] drunk.
939987 [20302] 
939987 [20303] â€œBe quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesnâ€™t mean that I called
939987 [20304] all Poland so. One _lajdak_ doesnâ€™t make a Poland. Be quiet, my pretty
939987 [20305] boy, eat a sweetmeat.â€
939987 [20306] 
939987 [20307] â€œAch, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why wonâ€™t they make
939987 [20308] friends?â€ said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke into
939987 [20309] â€œAh, my porch, my new porch!â€ Grushenka flung back her head, half opened
939987 [20310] her lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief, and suddenly, with a violent
939987 [20311] lurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking bewildered.
939987 [20312] 
939987 [20313] â€œIâ€™m weak....â€ she said in an exhausted voice. â€œForgive me.... Iâ€™m weak, I
939987 [20314] canâ€™t.... Iâ€™m sorry.â€
939987 [20315] 
939987 [20316] She bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.
939987 [20317] 
939987 [20318] â€œIâ€™m sorry.... Forgive me....â€
939987 [20319] 
939987 [20320] â€œThe ladyâ€™s been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,â€ voices were
939987 [20321] heard saying.
939987 [20322] 
939987 [20323] â€œThe ladyâ€™s drunk too much,â€ Maximov explained to the girls, giggling.
939987 [20324] 
939987 [20325] â€œMitya, lead me away ... take me,â€ said Grushenka helplessly. Mitya
939987 [20326] pounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the precious
939987 [20327] burden through the curtains.
939987 [20328] 
939987 [20329] â€œWell, now Iâ€™ll go,â€ thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue room,
939987 [20330] he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the orgy in the larger
939987 [20331] room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed
939987 [20332] and kissed her on the lips.
939987 [20333] 
939987 [20334] â€œDonâ€™t touch me....â€ she faltered, in an imploring voice. â€œDonâ€™t touch me,
939987 [20335] till Iâ€™m yours.... Iâ€™ve told you Iâ€™m yours, but donâ€™t touch me ... spare
939987 [20336] me.... With them here, with them close, you mustnâ€™t. Heâ€™s here. Itâ€™s nasty
939987 [20337] here....â€
939987 [20338] 
939987 [20339] â€œIâ€™ll obey you! I wonâ€™t think of it ... I worship you!â€ muttered Mitya.
939987 [20340] â€œYes, itâ€™s nasty here, itâ€™s abominable.â€
939987 [20341] 
939987 [20342] And still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.
939987 [20343] 
939987 [20344] â€œI know, though youâ€™re a brute, youâ€™re generous,â€ Grushenka articulated
939987 [20345] with difficulty. â€œIt must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for the
939987 [20346] future ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but good ...
939987 [20347] take me away, take me far away, do you hear? I donâ€™t want it to be here,
939987 [20348] but far, far away....â€
939987 [20349] 
939987 [20350] â€œOh, yes, yes, it must be!â€ said Mitya, pressing her in his arms. â€œIâ€™ll
939987 [20351] take you and weâ€™ll fly away.... Oh, Iâ€™d give my whole life for one year
939987 [20352] only to know about that blood!â€
939987 [20353] 
939987 [20354] â€œWhat blood?â€ asked Grushenka, bewildered.
939987 [20355] 
939987 [20356] â€œNothing,â€ muttered Mitya, through his teeth. â€œGrusha, you wanted to be
939987 [20357] honest, but Iâ€™m a thief. But Iâ€™ve stolen money from Katya.... Disgrace, a
939987 [20358] disgrace!â€
939987 [20359] 
939987 [20360] â€œFrom Katya, from that young lady? No, you didnâ€™t steal it. Give it her
939987 [20361] back, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is
939987 [20362] yours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like us
939987 [20363] are bound to waste money. But weâ€™d better go and work the land. I want to
939987 [20364] dig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said
939987 [20365] so. I wonâ€™t be your mistress, Iâ€™ll be faithful to you, Iâ€™ll be your slave,
939987 [20366] Iâ€™ll work for you. Weâ€™ll go to the young lady and bow down to her
939987 [20367] together, so that she may forgive us, and then weâ€™ll go away. And if she
939987 [20368] wonâ€™t forgive us, weâ€™ll go, anyway. Take her her money and love me....
939987 [20369] Donâ€™t love her.... Donâ€™t love her any more. If you love her, I shall
939987 [20370] strangle her.... Iâ€™ll put out both her eyes with a needle....â€
939987 [20371] 
939987 [20372] â€œI love you. I love only you. Iâ€™ll love you in Siberia....â€
939987 [20373] 
939987 [20374] â€œWhy Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I donâ€™t care ... weâ€™ll
939987 [20375] work ... thereâ€™s snow in Siberia.... I love driving in the snow ... and
939987 [20376] must have bells.... Do you hear, thereâ€™s a bell ringing? Where is that
939987 [20377] bell ringing? There are people coming.... Now itâ€™s stopped.â€
939987 [20378] 
939987 [20379] She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an instant.
939987 [20380] There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance, but the
939987 [20381] ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast. He did not
939987 [20382] notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice that the songs
939987 [20383] had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there was
939987 [20384] absolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened her eyes.
939987 [20385] 
939987 [20386] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... Iâ€™ve been asleep and
939987 [20387] dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was with
939987 [20388] some one I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was holding you and
939987 [20389] kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow glistened....
939987 [20390] You know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines. It was as
939987 [20391] though I was not on earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How
939987 [20392] sweet that is!...â€
939987 [20393] 
939987 [20394] â€œClose to you,â€ murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom, her hands.
939987 [20395] And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him that she was looking
939987 [20396] straight before her, not at him, not into his face, but over his head,
939987 [20397] with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An expression of wonder, almost of
939987 [20398] alarm, came suddenly into her face.
939987 [20399] 
939987 [20400] â€œMitya, who is that looking at us?â€ she whispered.
939987 [20401] 
939987 [20402] Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains and
939987 [20403] seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.
939987 [20404] 
939987 [20405] He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.
939987 [20406] 
939987 [20407] â€œHere, come to us, come here,â€ said a voice, speaking not loudly, but
939987 [20408] firmly and peremptorily.
939987 [20409] 
939987 [20410] Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still. The
939987 [20411] room was filled with people, but not those who had been there before. An
939987 [20412] instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered. He recognized
939987 [20413] all those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the overcoat and
939987 [20414] forage-cap with a cockadeâ€”was the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And
939987 [20415] that â€œconsumptive-lookingâ€ trim dandy, â€œwho always has such polished
939987 [20416] bootsâ€â€”that was the deputy prosecutor. â€œHe has a chronometer worth four
939987 [20417] hundred roubles; he showed it to me.â€ And that small young man in
939987 [20418] spectacles.... Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had seen him:
939987 [20419] he was the â€œinvestigating lawyer,â€ from the â€œschool of jurisprudence,â€ who
939987 [20420] had only lately come to the town. And this manâ€”the inspector of police,
939987 [20421] Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well. And those fellows with the
939987 [20422] brass plates on, why are they here? And those other two ... peasants....
939987 [20423] And there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....
939987 [20424] 
939987 [20425] â€œGentlemen! Whatâ€™s this for, gentlemen?â€ began Mitya, but suddenly, as
939987 [20426] though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing, he cried aloud, at
939987 [20427] the top of his voice:
939987 [20428] 
939987 [20429] â€œI unâ€”derâ€”stand!â€
939987 [20430] 
939987 [20431] The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up to
939987 [20432] Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:
939987 [20433] 
939987 [20434] â€œWe have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to the
939987 [20435] sofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.â€
939987 [20436] 
939987 [20437] â€œThe old man!â€ cried Mitya frantically. â€œThe old man and his blood!... I
939987 [20438] understand.â€
939987 [20439] 
939987 [20440] And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had been mown
939987 [20441] down by a scythe.
939987 [20442] 
939987 [20443] â€œYou understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your fatherâ€™s
939987 [20444] blood cries out against you!â€ the old captain of police roared suddenly,
939987 [20445] stepping up to Mitya.
939987 [20446] 
939987 [20447] He was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.
939987 [20448] 
939987 [20449] â€œThis is impossible!â€ cried the small young man. â€œMihail Makarovitch,
939987 [20450] Mihail Makarovitch, this wonâ€™t do!... I beg youâ€™ll allow me to speak. I
939987 [20451] should never have expected such behavior from you....â€
939987 [20452] 
939987 [20453] â€œThis is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,â€ cried the captain of
939987 [20454] police; â€œlook at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company of a
939987 [20455] disreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his hands.... Itâ€™s
939987 [20456] delirium!...â€
939987 [20457] 
939987 [20458] â€œI beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your
939987 [20459] feelings,â€ the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police
939987 [20460] captain, â€œor I shall be forced to resort toâ€”â€
939987 [20461] 
939987 [20462] But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to Mitya, and
939987 [20463] delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:
939987 [20464] 
939987 [20465] â€œEx-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are charged
939987 [20466] with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, perpetrated
939987 [20467] this night....â€
939987 [20468] 
939987 [20469] He said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, but
939987 [20470] though Mitya heard them he did not understand them. He stared at them all
939987 [20471] with wild eyes.

939987 [20478] 
939987 [20479] 
939987 [20480] Chapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotinâ€™s Official Career
939987 [20481] 
939987 [20482] 
939987 [20483] Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates
939987 [20484] of the widow Morozovâ€™s house, ended, of course, by making himself heard.
939987 [20485] Fenya, who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before,
939987 [20486] and too much â€œupsetâ€ to go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on
939987 [20487] hearing the furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him
939987 [20488] drive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking
939987 [20489] again, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the house-porter,
939987 [20490] who had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring him
939987 [20491] not to open it. But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he
939987 [20492] wanted to see Fenya on very â€œimportant business,â€ the man made up his mind
939987 [20493] at last to open. Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenyaâ€™s kitchen, but the
939987 [20494] girl begged him to allow the house-porter to be present, â€œbecause of her
939987 [20495] misgivings.â€ He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital
939987 [20496] fact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for
939987 [20497] Grushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he
939987 [20498] returned, the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with
939987 [20499] blood.
939987 [20500] 
939987 [20501] â€œAnd the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!â€ Fenya
939987 [20502] kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of her
939987 [20503] disordered imagination. But although not â€œdripping,â€ Pyotr Ilyitch had
939987 [20504] himself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash them.
939987 [20505] Moreover, the question he had to decide was not how soon the blood had
939987 [20506] dried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather,
939987 [20507] whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s, and how he could
939987 [20508] satisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this
939987 [20509] point, and though he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a
939987 [20510] conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his
939987 [20511] fatherâ€™s house, and that therefore something must have happened there.
939987 [20512] 
939987 [20513] â€œAnd when he came back,â€ Fenya added with excitement, â€œI told him the
939987 [20514] whole story, and then I began asking him, â€˜Why have you got blood on your
939987 [20515] hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?â€™ and he answered that that was human blood,
939987 [20516] and that he had just killed some one. He confessed it all to me, and
939987 [20517] suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking, whereâ€™s he
939987 [20518] run off to now like a madman? Heâ€™ll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my
939987 [20519] mistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running to his
939987 [20520] lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikovâ€™s shop, and saw him just setting off,
939987 [20521] and there was no blood on his hands then.â€ (Fenya had noticed this and
939987 [20522] remembered it.) Fenyaâ€™s old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far as
939987 [20523] she was capable. After asking some further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left
939987 [20524] the house, even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.
939987 [20525] 
939987 [20526] The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to go
939987 [20527] straight to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s, to find out whether anything had happened
939987 [20528] there, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain, as Pyotr
939987 [20529] Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had satisfied himself of the fact.
939987 [20530] But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s gates were strong, and he
939987 [20531] would have to knock again. His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of
939987 [20532] the slightest, and what if, after he had been knocking, they opened to
939987 [20533] him, and nothing had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way
939987 [20534] would go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called
939987 [20535] Perhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one had killed
939987 [20536] him. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded
939987 [20537] more than anything in the world.
939987 [20538] 
939987 [20539] Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he stamped
939987 [20540] his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not to Fyodor
939987 [20541] Pavlovitchâ€™s but to Madame Hohlakovâ€™s. He decided that if she denied
939987 [20542] having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he would go
939987 [20543] straight to the police captain, but if she admitted having given him the
939987 [20544] money, he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning.
939987 [20545] 
939987 [20546] It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of
939987 [20547] causing scandal by going at eleven oâ€™clock at night to a fashionable lady,
939987 [20548] a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her an
939987 [20549] amazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that is just how
939987 [20550] it is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one, with the
939987 [20551] decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by
939987 [20552] no means phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all his life how a
939987 [20553] haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him, growing more and
939987 [20554] more painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursing
939987 [20555] himself, of course, all the way for going to this lady, but â€œI will get to
939987 [20556] the bottom of it, I will!â€ he repeated for the tenth time, grinding his
939987 [20557] teeth, and he carried out his intention.
939987 [20558] 
939987 [20559] It was exactly eleven oâ€™clock when he entered Madame Hohlakovâ€™s house. He
939987 [20560] was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his inquiry
939987 [20561] whether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer, except
939987 [20562] that she was usually in bed by that time.
939987 [20563] 
939987 [20564] â€œAsk at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, sheâ€™ll
939987 [20565] receive you. If she wonâ€™t, she wonâ€™t.â€
939987 [20566] 
939987 [20567] Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The footman
939987 [20568] was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid. Pyotr
939987 [20569] Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that an
939987 [20570] official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on particular
939987 [20571] business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would not
939987 [20572] have ventured to come. â€œTell her in those words, in those words exactly,â€
939987 [20573] he asked the girl.
939987 [20574] 
939987 [20575] She went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov herself
939987 [20576] was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt upset ever
939987 [20577] since Mityaâ€™s visit, and had a presentiment that she would not get through
939987 [20578] the night without the sick headache which always, with her, followed such
939987 [20579] excitement. She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.
939987 [20580] She irritably declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at
939987 [20581] such an hour, of an â€œofficial living in the town,â€ who was a total
939987 [20582] stranger, roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr
939987 [20583] Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to
939987 [20584] take another message in these very words:
939987 [20585] 
939987 [20586] â€œThat he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that Madame
939987 [20587] Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to see him
939987 [20588] now.â€
939987 [20589] 
939987 [20590] â€œI plunged headlong,â€ he described it afterwards.
939987 [20591] 
939987 [20592] The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again.
939987 [20593] Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he looked
939987 [20594] like, and learned that he was â€œvery well dressed, young and so polite.â€ We
939987 [20595] may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking
939987 [20596] young man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to
939987 [20597] see him. She was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black
939987 [20598] shawl over her shoulders. â€œThe officialâ€ was asked to walk into the
939987 [20599] drawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly
939987 [20600] before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiring
939987 [20601] countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once with the
939987 [20602] question:
939987 [20603] 
939987 [20604] â€œWhat do you want?â€
939987 [20605] 
939987 [20606] â€œI have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our common
939987 [20607] acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,â€ Perhotin began.
939987 [20608] 
939987 [20609] But he had hardly uttered the name, when the ladyâ€™s face showed signs of
939987 [20610] acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a fury:
939987 [20611] 
939987 [20612] â€œHow much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?â€ she cried
939987 [20613] hysterically. â€œHow dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a lady
939987 [20614] who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And to
939987 [20615] force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this very
939987 [20616] drawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out of
939987 [20617] the room, as no one would go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir,
939987 [20618] that I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass.
939987 [20619] Kindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... Iâ€”â€
939987 [20620] 
939987 [20621] â€œMurder! then he tried to murder you, too?â€
939987 [20622] 
939987 [20623] â€œWhy, has he killed somebody else?â€ Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively.
939987 [20624] 
939987 [20625] â€œIf you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, Iâ€™ll explain it all
939987 [20626] in a couple of words,â€ answered Perhotin, firmly. â€œAt five oâ€™clock this
939987 [20627] afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I know for
939987 [20628] a fact he had no money. Yet at nine oâ€™clock, he came to see me with a
939987 [20629] bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, about two or three thousand
939987 [20630] roubles. His hands and face were all covered with blood, and he looked
939987 [20631] like a madman. When I asked him where he had got so much money, he
939987 [20632] answered that he had just received it from you, that you had given him a
939987 [20633] sum of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....â€
939987 [20634] 
939987 [20635] Madame Hohlakovâ€™s face assumed an expression of intense and painful
939987 [20636] excitement.
939987 [20637] 
939987 [20638] â€œGood God! He must have killed his old father!â€ she cried, clasping her
939987 [20639] hands. â€œI have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Donâ€™t say
939987 [20640] another word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!â€
939987 [20641] 
939987 [20642] â€œExcuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for a
939987 [20643] fact that you did not give him any money?â€
939987 [20644] 
939987 [20645] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t, I didnâ€™t! I refused to give it him, for he could not
939987 [20646] appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but I
939987 [20647] slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from you
939987 [20648] now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are we
939987 [20649] standing? Ah, sit down.â€
939987 [20650] 
939987 [20651] â€œExcuse me, I....â€
939987 [20652] 
939987 [20653] â€œOr better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an awful
939987 [20654] death!â€
939987 [20655] 
939987 [20656] â€œBut if he has killed him already?â€
939987 [20657] 
939987 [20658] â€œAh, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think we
939987 [20659] must do now?â€
939987 [20660] 
939987 [20661] Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself, facing
939987 [20662] him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her the history of
939987 [20663] the affair, that part of it at least which he had himself witnessed. He
939987 [20664] described, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her about the pestle. All
939987 [20665] these details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who
939987 [20666] kept uttering shrieks, and covering her face with her hands....
939987 [20667] 
939987 [20668] â€œWould you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty,
939987 [20669] whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often Iâ€™ve looked at that awful
939987 [20670] man and always thought, that man will end by murdering me. And now itâ€™s
939987 [20671] happened ... that is, if he hasnâ€™t murdered me, but only his own father,
939987 [20672] itâ€™s only because the finger of God preserved me, and whatâ€™s more, he was
939987 [20673] ashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from
939987 [20674] the relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to think
939987 [20675] how near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him and he
939987 [20676] stretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you
939987 [20677] said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I donâ€™t believe in miracles, but that
939987 [20678] ikon and this unmistakable miracle with me nowâ€”that shakes me, and Iâ€™m
939987 [20679] ready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about Father
939987 [20680] Zossima?... But I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m saying ... and only fancy, with the
939987 [20681] ikon on his neck he spat at me.... He only spat, itâ€™s true, he didnâ€™t
939987 [20682] murder me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we do
939987 [20683] now? What do you think?â€
939987 [20684] 
939987 [20685] Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight to the
939987 [20686] police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do what he
939987 [20687] thought fit.
939987 [20688] 
939987 [20689] â€œOh, heâ€™s an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I know him. Of
939987 [20690] course, heâ€™s the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr Ilyitch!
939987 [20691] How well youâ€™ve thought of everything! I should never have thought of it
939987 [20692] in your place!â€
939987 [20693] 
939987 [20694] â€œEspecially as I know the police captain very well, too,â€ observed Pyotr
939987 [20695] Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious to escape
939987 [20696] as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not let him say
939987 [20697] good-by and go away.
939987 [20698] 
939987 [20699] â€œAnd be sure, be sure,â€ she prattled on, â€œto come back and tell me what
939987 [20700] you see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... how
939987 [20701] theyâ€™ll try him ... and what heâ€™s condemned to.... Tell me, we have no
939987 [20702] capital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if itâ€™s at three
939987 [20703] oâ€™clock at night, at four, at half-past four.... Tell them to wake me, to
939987 [20704] wake me, to shake me, if I donâ€™t get up.... But, good heavens, I shanâ€™t
939987 [20705] sleep! But wait, hadnâ€™t I better come with you?â€
939987 [20706] 
939987 [20707] â€œNâ€”no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating that
939987 [20708] you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be of use
939987 [20709] ... in case itâ€™s needed....â€
939987 [20710] 
939987 [20711] â€œTo be sure!â€ Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau. â€œAnd you
939987 [20712] know Iâ€™m simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense in
939987 [20713] such affairs. Are you in the service here? Iâ€™m delighted to think that
939987 [20714] youâ€™re in the service here!â€
939987 [20715] 
939987 [20716] And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the
939987 [20717] following lines:
939987 [20718] 
939987 [20719] 
939987 [20720]     Iâ€™ve never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri
939987 [20721]     Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy),
939987 [20722]     three thousand roubles to-day. Iâ€™ve never given him money, never:
939987 [20723]     That I swear by all thatâ€™s holy!
939987 [20724] 
939987 [20725]     K. HOHLAKOV.
939987 [20726] 
939987 [20727] 
939987 [20728] â€œHereâ€™s the note!â€ she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. â€œGo, save him.
939987 [20729] Itâ€™s a noble deed on your part!â€
939987 [20730] 
939987 [20731] And she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran out to
939987 [20732] accompany him to the passage.
939987 [20733] 
939987 [20734] â€œHow grateful I am to you! You canâ€™t think how grateful I am to you for
939987 [20735] having come to me, first. How is it I havenâ€™t met you before? I shall feel
939987 [20736] flattered at seeing you at my house in the future. How delightful it is
939987 [20737] that you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical ability!...
939987 [20738] They must appreciate you, they must understand you. If thereâ€™s anything I
939987 [20739] can do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! Iâ€™m in love with young
939987 [20740] people! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country.
939987 [20741] Her one hope.... Oh, go, go!...â€
939987 [20742] 
939987 [20743] But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let him go so
939987 [20744] soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him,
939987 [20745] which had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such an
939987 [20746] unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all know. â€œSheâ€™s by no means so
939987 [20747] elderly,â€ he thought, feeling pleased, â€œon the contrary I should have
939987 [20748] taken her for her daughter.â€
939987 [20749] 
939987 [20750] As for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young man. â€œSuch
939987 [20751] sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all that with
939987 [20752] such manners and appearance! People say the young people of to-day are no
939987 [20753] good for anything, but hereâ€™s an example!â€ etc. So she simply forgot this
939987 [20754] â€œdreadful affair,â€ and it was only as she was getting into bed, that,
939987 [20755] suddenly recalling â€œhow near death she had been,â€ she exclaimed: â€œAh, it
939987 [20756] is awful, awful!â€
939987 [20757] 
939987 [20758] But she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.
939987 [20759] 
939987 [20760] I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details,
939987 [20761] if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no means
939987 [20762] elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of the
939987 [20763] whole career of that practical and precise young man. His story is
939987 [20764] remembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I shall perhaps
939987 [20765] have something to say about it, when I have finished my long history of
939987 [20766] the Brothers Karamazov.
939987 [20767] 
939987 [20768] 
939987 [20769] 
939987 [20770] Chapter II. The Alarm
939987 [20771] 
939987 [20772] 
939987 [20773] Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired
939987 [20774] lieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only come
939987 [20775] to us three years previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly because
939987 [20776] he â€œknew how to keep society together.â€ He was never without visitors, and
939987 [20777] could not have got on without them. Some one or other was always dining
939987 [20778] with him; he never sat down to table without guests. He gave regular
939987 [20779] dinners, too, on all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones.
939987 [20780] Though the fare was not _recherchÃ©_, it was abundant. The fish-pies were
939987 [20781] excellent, and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.
939987 [20782] 
939987 [20783] The first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room, with
939987 [20784] pictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls, an
939987 [20785] essential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelorâ€™s billiard-room.
939987 [20786] There was card-playing every evening at his house, if only at one table.
939987 [20787] But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the mammas
939987 [20788] and young ladies, assembled at his house to dance. Though Mihail
939987 [20789] Makarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone. His widowed daughter
939987 [20790] lived with him, with her two unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who had
939987 [20791] finished their education. They were of agreeable appearance and lively
939987 [20792] character, and though every one knew they would have no dowry, they
939987 [20793] attracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfatherâ€™s house.
939987 [20794] 
939987 [20795] Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work, though he
939987 [20796] performed his duties no worse than many others. To speak plainly, he was a
939987 [20797] man of rather narrow education. His understanding of the limits of his
939987 [20798] administrative power could not always be relied upon. It was not so much
939987 [20799] that he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign,
939987 [20800] as that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them. This
939987 [20801] was not from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for
939987 [20802] he was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.
939987 [20803] 
939987 [20804] â€œI have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,â€ he used to say
939987 [20805] of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamental
939987 [20806] principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs,
939987 [20807] and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year, involuntarily
939987 [20808] increasing his knowledge by practice. And yet he was himself a landowner.
939987 [20809] Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he would meet some of Mihail
939987 [20810] Makarovitchâ€™s visitors there that evening, but he didnâ€™t know which. As it
939987 [20811] happened, at that moment the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district
939987 [20812] doctor, a young man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after
939987 [20813] taking a brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist
939987 [20814] at the police captainâ€™s. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was
939987 [20815] really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),
939987 [20816] was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined to be
939987 [20817] consumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He was vain and
939987 [20818] irritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a kind heart. It
939987 [20819] seemed that all that was wrong with him was that he had a better opinion
939987 [20820] of himself than his ability warranted. And that made him seem constantly
939987 [20821] uneasy. He had, moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards
939987 [20822] psychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a special
939987 [20823] knowledge of the criminal and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this
939987 [20824] ground, considering that he had been passed over in the service, and being
939987 [20825] firmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properly
939987 [20826] appreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to give
939987 [20827] up his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected
939987 [20828] Karamazov case agitated him profoundly: â€œIt was a case that might well be
939987 [20829] talked about all over Russia.â€ But I am anticipating.
939987 [20830] 
939987 [20831] Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who had
939987 [20832] only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next room
939987 [20833] with the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards and wondered that
939987 [20834] all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the evening of â€œthe
939987 [20835] crimeâ€ have been gathered together at the house of the executive
939987 [20836] authority. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.
939987 [20837] 
939987 [20838] Ippolit Kirillovitchâ€™s wife had had toothache for the last two days, and
939987 [20839] he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor, from the
939987 [20840] very nature of his being, could not spend an evening except at cards.
939987 [20841] Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days past to
939987 [20842] drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitchâ€™s, so to speak casually, so as
939987 [20843] slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showing
939987 [20844] that he knew her secret, that he knew it was her birthday, and that she
939987 [20845] was trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give a
939987 [20846] dance. He anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests about
939987 [20847] her age, and her being afraid to reveal it, about his knowing her secret
939987 [20848] and telling everybody, and so on. The charming young man was a great adept
939987 [20849] at such teasing; the ladies had christened him â€œthe naughty man,â€ and he
939987 [20850] seemed to be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however,
939987 [20851] of good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of
939987 [20852] pleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He was
939987 [20853] short, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he
939987 [20854] always wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his
939987 [20855] official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though
939987 [20856] realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him.
939987 [20857] He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the
939987 [20858] peasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their respect,
939987 [20859] he certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.
939987 [20860] 
939987 [20861] Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police
939987 [20862] captainâ€™s. He saw instantly that every one knew. They had positively
939987 [20863] thrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even Nikolay
939987 [20864] Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous and
939987 [20865] ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news that old
939987 [20866] Fyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his own house,
939987 [20867] murdered and robbed. The news had only just reached them in the following
939987 [20868] manner.
939987 [20869] 
939987 [20870] Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senseless
939987 [20871] near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might well have slept
939987 [20872] till morning after the draught she had taken. But, all of a sudden she
939987 [20873] waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov,
939987 [20874] who was lying in the next room unconscious. That scream always preceded
939987 [20875] his fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never
939987 [20876] get accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakovâ€™s
939987 [20877] room. But it was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginning
939987 [20878] to gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out and was
939987 [20879] going to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when she had got up,
939987 [20880] he was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the bedstead and began
939987 [20881] groping with her hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he must have
939987 [20882] gone outâ€”where? She ran to the steps and timidly called him. She got no
939987 [20883] answer, of course, but she caught the sound of groans far away in the
939987 [20884] garden in the darkness. She listened. The groans were repeated, and it was
939987 [20885] evident they came from the garden.
939987 [20886] 
939987 [20887] â€œGood Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!â€ she thought
939987 [20888] distractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate into
939987 [20889] the garden was open.
939987 [20890] 
939987 [20891] â€œHe must be out there, poor dear,â€ she thought. She went up to the gate
939987 [20892] and all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her by name, â€œMarfa!
939987 [20893] Marfa!â€ in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.
939987 [20894] 
939987 [20895] â€œLord, preserve us from harm!â€ Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran towards
939987 [20896] the voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she found him not by
939987 [20897] the fence where he had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. It
939987 [20898] appeared later, that he had crawled away on coming to himself, and
939987 [20899] probably had been a long time getting so far, losing consciousness several
939987 [20900] times. She noticed at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at
939987 [20901] the top of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:
939987 [20902] 
939987 [20903] â€œHe has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream, silly ... run ...
939987 [20904] fetch some one....â€
939987 [20905] 
939987 [20906] But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her masterâ€™s window was
939987 [20907] open and that there was a candle alight in the window, she ran there and
939987 [20908] began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in at the window, she saw a
939987 [20909] fearful sight. Her master was lying on his back, motionless, on the floor.
939987 [20910] His light-colored dressing-gown and white shirt were soaked with blood.
939987 [20911] The candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless
939987 [20912] dead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from
939987 [20913] the window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran
939987 [20914] headlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both mother
939987 [20915] and daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfaâ€™s desperate and
939987 [20916] persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter. Marfa, shrieking and
939987 [20917] screaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg for
939987 [20918] assistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his wanderings and
939987 [20919] was staying the night with them. They got him up immediately and all three
939987 [20920] ran to the scene of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered
939987 [20921] that at about eight oâ€™clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,
939987 [20922] and this was no doubt Grigoryâ€™s scream, â€œParricide!â€ uttered when he
939987 [20923] caught hold of Mityaâ€™s leg.
939987 [20924] 
939987 [20925] â€œSome one person screamed out and then was silent,â€ Marya Kondratyevna
939987 [20926] explained as she ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the two
939987 [20927] women with the help of Foma carried him to the lodge. They lighted a
939987 [20928] candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he was writhing in
939987 [20929] convulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing from
939987 [20930] his lips. They moistened Grigoryâ€™s forehead with water mixed with vinegar,
939987 [20931] and the water revived him at once. He asked immediately:
939987 [20932] 
939987 [20933] â€œIs the master murdered?â€
939987 [20934] 
939987 [20935] Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that not
939987 [20936] only the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open, though
939987 [20937] Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every night and
939987 [20938] did not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext. Seeing that door
939987 [20939] open, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch â€œfor fear anything
939987 [20940] should happen afterwards.â€ And when they returned to Grigory, the old man
939987 [20941] told them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran
939987 [20942] there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captainâ€™s. She
939987 [20943] arrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story came,
939987 [20944] not as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation, by a
939987 [20945] witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the criminal (a
939987 [20946] theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe till that
939987 [20947] moment).
939987 [20948] 
939987 [20949] It was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector of the
939987 [20950] town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s
939987 [20951] house and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regular
939987 [20952] forms, which I will not go into here. The district doctor, a zealous man,
939987 [20953] new to his work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, the
939987 [20954] prosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.
939987 [20955] 
939987 [20956] I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead,
939987 [20957] with his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with the same
939987 [20958] weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that weapon
939987 [20959] was found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at once
939987 [20960] given, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knocked
939987 [20961] down. They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass
939987 [20962] pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were
939987 [20963] no signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. But
939987 [20964] by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and
939987 [20965] thick envelope with the inscription: â€œA present of three thousand roubles
939987 [20966] for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.â€ And below had been
939987 [20967] added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, â€œFor my little chicken.â€ There were three
939987 [20968] seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open and
939987 [20969] was empty: the money had been removed. They found also on the floor a
939987 [20970] piece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up.
939987 [20971] 
939987 [20972] One piece of Pyotr Ilyitchâ€™s evidence made a great impression on the
939987 [20973] prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that Dmitri
939987 [20974] Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved to
939987 [20975] do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded them
939987 [20976] before him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc. When Pyotr
939987 [20977] Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell some
939987 [20978] one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: â€œYouâ€™ll be
939987 [20979] too late.â€ So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before
939987 [20980] he really did shoot himself.
939987 [20981] 
939987 [20982] â€œThatâ€™s clear, thatâ€™s clear!â€ repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.
939987 [20983] â€œThatâ€™s just the way with mad fellows like that: â€˜I shall kill myself
939987 [20984] to-morrow, so Iâ€™ll make merry till I die!â€™ â€
939987 [20985] 
939987 [20986] The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the
939987 [20987] prosecutor more than ever.
939987 [20988] 
939987 [20989] â€œDo you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev,
939987 [20990] gentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair curled,
939987 [20991] and then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his hand in
939987 [20992] the same way, he went off to the girls.â€
939987 [20993] 
939987 [20994] All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the
939987 [20995] formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took time and
939987 [20996] so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer of
939987 [20997] the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in the
939987 [20998] town the morning before to get his pay. He was instructed to avoid raising
939987 [20999] the alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the
939987 [21000] â€œcriminalâ€ till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also
939987 [21001] witnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky
939987 [21002] Mavrikyevitch did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no
939987 [21003] one but his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of
939987 [21004] his secret business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the
939987 [21005] landlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once
939987 [21006] a change in Trifon Borissovitchâ€™s face and voice. So neither Mitya nor any
939987 [21007] one else knew that he was being watched. The box with the pistols had been
939987 [21008] carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. Only after
939987 [21009] four oâ€™clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain,
939987 [21010] the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each
939987 [21011] drawn by three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s to make
939987 [21012] a post-mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly interested in
939987 [21013] the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.
939987 [21014] 
939987 [21015] â€œSuch violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for
939987 [21016] twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to
939987 [21017] science,â€ he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they left
939987 [21018] they laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor and the
939987 [21019] investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctorâ€™s saying that
939987 [21020] Smerdyakov could not outlive the night.
939987 [21021] 
939987 [21022] After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to
939987 [21023] that moment of our tale at which we broke off.
939987 [21024] 
939987 [21025] 
939987 [21026] 
939987 [21027] Chapter III. The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First Ordeal
939987 [21028] 
939987 [21029] 
939987 [21030] And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not understanding
939987 [21031] what was said to him. Suddenly he got up, flung up his hands, and shouted
939987 [21032] aloud:
939987 [21033] 
939987 [21034] â€œIâ€™m not guilty! Iâ€™m not guilty of that blood! Iâ€™m not guilty of my
939987 [21035] fatherâ€™s blood.... I meant to kill him. But Iâ€™m not guilty. Not I.â€
939987 [21036] 
939987 [21037] But he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind the
939987 [21038] curtain and flung herself at the police captainâ€™s feet.
939987 [21039] 
939987 [21040] â€œIt was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!â€ she cried, in a heartrending
939987 [21041] voice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands towards them. â€œHe
939987 [21042] did it through me. I tortured him and drove him to it. I tortured that
939987 [21043] poor old man thatâ€™s dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him to this!
939987 [21044] Itâ€™s my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!â€
939987 [21045] 
939987 [21046] â€œYes, itâ€™s your fault! Youâ€™re the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!
939987 [21047] Youâ€™re the most to blame!â€ shouted the police captain, threatening her
939987 [21048] with his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed. The
939987 [21049] prosecutor positively seized hold of him.
939987 [21050] 
939987 [21051] â€œThis is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!â€ he cried. â€œYou are
939987 [21052] positively hindering the inquiry.... Youâ€™re ruining the case....â€ he
939987 [21053] almost gasped.
939987 [21054] 
939987 [21055] â€œFollow the regular course! Follow the regular course!â€ cried Nikolay
939987 [21056] Parfenovitch, fearfully excited too, â€œotherwise itâ€™s absolutely
939987 [21057] impossible!...â€
939987 [21058] 
939987 [21059] â€œJudge us together!â€ Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling. â€œPunish
939987 [21060] us together. I will go with him now, if itâ€™s to death!â€
939987 [21061] 
939987 [21062] â€œGrusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!â€ Mitya fell on his knees beside
939987 [21063] her and held her tight in his arms. â€œDonâ€™t believe her,â€ he cried, â€œsheâ€™s
939987 [21064] not guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!â€
939987 [21065] 
939987 [21066] He remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her by
939987 [21067] several men, and that she was led out, and that when he recovered himself
939987 [21068] he was sitting at the table. Beside him and behind him stood the men with
939987 [21069] metal plates. Facing him on the other side of the table sat Nikolay
939987 [21070] Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink a
939987 [21071] little water out of a glass that stood on the table.
939987 [21072] 
939987 [21073] â€œThat will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, donâ€™t be frightened,â€
939987 [21074] he added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it afterwards) became
939987 [21075] suddenly intensely interested in his big rings, one with an amethyst, and
939987 [21076] another with a transparent bright yellow stone, of great brilliance. And
939987 [21077] long afterwards he remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted his
939987 [21078] attention through all those terrible hours of interrogation, so that he
939987 [21079] was utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as
939987 [21080] things that had nothing to do with his position. On Mityaâ€™s left side, in
939987 [21081] the place where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening,
939987 [21082] the prosecutor was now seated, and on Mityaâ€™s right hand, where Grushenka
939987 [21083] had been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting-jacket,
939987 [21084] with ink and paper before him. This was the secretary of the investigating
939987 [21085] lawyer, who had brought him with him. The police captain was now standing
939987 [21086] by the window at the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was
939987 [21087] sitting there.
939987 [21088] 
939987 [21089] â€œDrink some water,â€ said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenth
939987 [21090] time.
939987 [21091] 
939987 [21092] â€œI have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush me,
939987 [21093] punish me, decide my fate!â€ cried Mitya, staring with terribly fixed
939987 [21094] wide-open eyes at the investigating lawyer.
939987 [21095] 
939987 [21096] â€œSo you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your
939987 [21097] father, Fyodor Pavlovitch?â€ asked the investigating lawyer, softly but
939987 [21098] insistently.
939987 [21099] 
939987 [21100] â€œI am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not of
939987 [21101] my fatherâ€™s. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the old man and knocked
939987 [21102] him down.... But itâ€™s hard to have to answer for that murder with another,
939987 [21103] a terrible murder of which I am not guilty.... Itâ€™s a terrible accusation,
939987 [21104] gentlemen, a knock-down blow. But who has killed my father, who has killed
939987 [21105] him? Who can have killed him if I didnâ€™t? Itâ€™s marvelous, extraordinary,
939987 [21106] impossible.â€
939987 [21107] 
939987 [21108] â€œYes, who can have killed him?â€ the investigating lawyer was beginning,
939987 [21109] but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him, addressed
939987 [21110] Mitya.
939987 [21111] 
939987 [21112] â€œYou need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory Vassilyevitch.
939987 [21113] He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible blows
939987 [21114] inflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by you, there seems no
939987 [21115] doubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at least.â€
939987 [21116] 
939987 [21117] â€œAlive? Heâ€™s alive?â€ cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His face beamed.
939987 [21118] â€œLord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a sinner and
939987 [21119] evildoer. Thatâ€™s an answer to my prayer. Iâ€™ve been praying all night.â€ And
939987 [21120] he crossed himself three times. He was almost breathless.
939987 [21121] 
939987 [21122] â€œSo from this Grigory we have received such important evidence concerning
939987 [21123] you, thatâ€”â€ The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya suddenly jumped
939987 [21124] up from his chair.
939987 [21125] 
939987 [21126] â€œOne minute, gentlemen, for Godâ€™s sake, one minute; I will run to herâ€”â€
939987 [21127] 
939987 [21128] â€œExcuse me, at this moment itâ€™s quite impossible,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch
939987 [21129] almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was seized by the men
939987 [21130] with the metal plates, but he sat down of his own accord....
939987 [21131] 
939987 [21132] â€œGentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute only; I wanted
939987 [21133] to tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone, that blood that was
939987 [21134] weighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a murderer now!
939987 [21135] Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!â€ he said ecstatically and reverently,
939987 [21136] looking round at them all. â€œOh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute
939987 [21137] you have given me new life, new heart!... That old man used to carry me in
939987 [21138] his arms, gentlemen. He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three
939987 [21139] years old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...â€
939987 [21140] 
939987 [21141] â€œAnd so youâ€”â€ the investigating lawyer began.
939987 [21142] 
939987 [21143] â€œAllow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,â€ interposed Mitya, putting
939987 [21144] his elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands. â€œLet me have
939987 [21145] a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is horribly
939987 [21146] upsetting, horribly. A man is not a drum, gentlemen!â€
939987 [21147] 
939987 [21148] â€œDrink a little more water,â€ murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [21149] 
939987 [21150] Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were confident.
939987 [21151] He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole bearing was
939987 [21152] changed; he was once more the equal of these men, with all of whom he was
939987 [21153] acquainted, as though they had all met the day before, when nothing had
939987 [21154] happened, at some social gathering. We may note in passing that, on his
939987 [21155] first arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captainâ€™s,
939987 [21156] but later, during the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at
939987 [21157] all, and when the police captain met him, in the street, for instance,
939987 [21158] Mitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His
939987 [21159] acquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes
939987 [21160] paid his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without
939987 [21161] quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had, for
939987 [21162] some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not had time
939987 [21163] to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had met him and talked
939987 [21164] to him twice, each time about the fair sex.
939987 [21165] 
939987 [21166] â€œYouâ€™re a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,â€ cried Mitya,
939987 [21167] laughing gayly, â€œbut I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen, I feel like a new
939987 [21168] man, and donâ€™t be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly.
939987 [21169] Iâ€™m rather drunk, too, Iâ€™ll tell you that frankly. I believe Iâ€™ve had the
939987 [21170] honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman
939987 [21171] MiÃ¼sovâ€™s. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I donâ€™t pretend to be on equal terms with
939987 [21172] you. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before you.
939987 [21173] Oh, of course, thereâ€™s a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if
939987 [21174] Grigory has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! Itâ€™s awful, awful, I
939987 [21175] understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will make
939987 [21176] an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen! Since I know
939987 [21177] Iâ€™m innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute. Canâ€™t we? Canâ€™t we?â€
939987 [21178] 
939987 [21179] Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though he
939987 [21180] positively took his listeners to be his best friends.
939987 [21181] 
939987 [21182] â€œSo, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the charge
939987 [21183] brought against you,â€ said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively, and bending
939987 [21184] down to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what to write.
939987 [21185] 
939987 [21186] â€œWrite it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I consent, I
939987 [21187] give my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay, stay, write
939987 [21188] this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of violence on a poor old man I
939987 [21189] am guilty. And there is something else at the bottom of my heart, of which
939987 [21190] I am guilty, tooâ€”but that you need not write downâ€ (he turned suddenly to
939987 [21191] the secretary); â€œthatâ€™s my personal life, gentlemen, that doesnâ€™t concern
939987 [21192] you, the bottom of my heart, thatâ€™s to say.... But of the murder of my old
939987 [21193] father Iâ€™m not guilty. Thatâ€™s a wild idea. Itâ€™s quite a wild idea!... I
939987 [21194] will prove you that and youâ€™ll be convinced directly.... You will laugh,
939987 [21195] gentlemen. Youâ€™ll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!...â€
939987 [21196] 
939987 [21197] â€œBe calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ said the investigating lawyer evidently
939987 [21198] trying to allay Mityaâ€™s excitement by his own composure. â€œBefore we go on
939987 [21199] with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to hear
939987 [21200] you confirm the statement that you disliked your father, Fyodor
939987 [21201] Pavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him. Here at
939987 [21202] least, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill
939987 [21203] him: â€˜I didnâ€™t kill him,â€™ you said, â€˜but I wanted to kill him.â€™ â€
939987 [21204] 
939987 [21205] â€œDid I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I did
939987 [21206] want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily, unhappily!â€
939987 [21207] 
939987 [21208] â€œYou wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives precisely led
939987 [21209] you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?â€
939987 [21210] 
939987 [21211] â€œWhat is there to explain, gentlemen?â€ Mitya shrugged his shoulders
939987 [21212] sullenly, looking down. â€œI have never concealed my feelings. All the town
939987 [21213] knows about itâ€”every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I declared them
939987 [21214] in Father Zossimaâ€™s cell.... And the very same day, in the evening I beat
939987 [21215] my father. I nearly killed him, and I swore Iâ€™d come again and kill him,
939987 [21216] before witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! Iâ€™ve been shouting it aloud
939987 [21217] for the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares you in
939987 [21218] the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,
939987 [21219] feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemenâ€â€”Mitya frownedâ€”â€œit seems
939987 [21220] to me that about feelings youâ€™ve no right to question me. I know that you
939987 [21221] are bound by your office, I quite understand that, but thatâ€™s my affair,
939987 [21222] my private, intimate affair, yet ... since I havenâ€™t concealed my feelings
939987 [21223] in the past ... in the tavern, for instance, Iâ€™ve talked to every one, so
939987 [21224] ... so I wonâ€™t make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,
939987 [21225] that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every
939987 [21226] one that Iâ€™d kill him, and now, all of a sudden, heâ€™s been killed. So it
939987 [21227] must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can
939987 [21228] quite make allowances. Iâ€™m struck all of a heap myself, for who can have
939987 [21229] murdered him, if not I? Thatâ€™s what it comes to, isnâ€™t it? If not I, who
939987 [21230] can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on knowing!â€ he
939987 [21231] exclaimed suddenly. â€œWhere was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and
939987 [21232] with what? Tell me,â€ he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.
939987 [21233] 
939987 [21234] â€œWe found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his head
939987 [21235] battered in,â€ said the prosecutor.
939987 [21236] 
939987 [21237] â€œThatâ€™s horrible!â€ Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the table,
939987 [21238] hid his face in his right hand.
939987 [21239] 
939987 [21240] â€œWe will continue,â€ interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. â€œSo what was it that
939987 [21241] impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in public, I
939987 [21242] believe, that it was based upon jealousy?â€
939987 [21243] 
939987 [21244] â€œWell, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.â€
939987 [21245] 
939987 [21246] â€œDisputes about money?â€
939987 [21247] 
939987 [21248] â€œYes, about money, too.â€
939987 [21249] 
939987 [21250] â€œThere was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which you
939987 [21251] claimed as part of your inheritance?â€
939987 [21252] 
939987 [21253] â€œThree thousand! More, more,â€ cried Mitya hotly; â€œmore than six thousand,
939987 [21254] more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at them. But I
939987 [21255] made up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was desperately in need
939987 [21256] of that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes for three thousand that
939987 [21257] I knew he kept under his pillow, ready for Grushenka, I considered as
939987 [21258] simply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own
939987 [21259] property....â€
939987 [21260] 
939987 [21261] The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and had
939987 [21262] time to wink at him on the sly.
939987 [21263] 
939987 [21264] â€œWe will return to that subject later,â€ said the lawyer promptly. â€œYou
939987 [21265] will allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked upon
939987 [21266] that money as your own property?â€
939987 [21267] 
939987 [21268] â€œWrite it down, by all means. I know thatâ€™s another fact that tells
939987 [21269] against me, but Iâ€™m not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself. Do
939987 [21270] you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort of man
939987 [21271] from what I am,â€ he added, suddenly gloomy and dejected. â€œYou have to deal
939987 [21272] with a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above allâ€”donâ€™t lose
939987 [21273] sight of itâ€”a man whoâ€™s done a lot of nasty things, but has always been,
939987 [21274] and still is, honorable at bottom, in his inner being. I donâ€™t know how to
939987 [21275] express it. Thatâ€™s just whatâ€™s made me wretched all my life, that I
939987 [21276] yearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of
939987 [21277] honor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and
939987 [21278] yet all my life Iâ€™ve been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemen
939987 [21279] ... that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!...
939987 [21280] Gentlemen, my head aches ...â€ His brows contracted with pain. â€œYou see,
939987 [21281] gentlemen, I couldnâ€™t bear the look of him, there was something in him
939987 [21282] ignoble, impudent, trampling on everything sacred, something sneering and
939987 [21283] irreverent, loathsome, loathsome. But now that heâ€™s dead, I feel
939987 [21284] differently.â€
939987 [21285] 
939987 [21286] â€œHow do you mean?â€
939987 [21287] 
939987 [21288] â€œI donâ€™t feel differently, but I wish I hadnâ€™t hated him so.â€
939987 [21289] 
939987 [21290] â€œYou feel penitent?â€
939987 [21291] 
939987 [21292] â€œNo, not penitent, donâ€™t write that. Iâ€™m not much good myself, Iâ€™m not
939987 [21293] very beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive. Thatâ€™s what I
939987 [21294] mean. Write that down, if you like.â€
939987 [21295] 
939987 [21296] Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more gloomy
939987 [21297] as the inquiry continued.
939987 [21298] 
939987 [21299] At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka had
939987 [21300] been removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next but
939987 [21301] one from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It was a
939987 [21302] little room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they had
939987 [21303] danced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her
939987 [21304] but Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her
939987 [21305] side, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants with
939987 [21306] a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her grief
939987 [21307] was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her arms and, with a loud
939987 [21308] wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him, to her Mitya, and so
939987 [21309] unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry,
939987 [21310] trembled, jumped up, and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, not
939987 [21311] knowing what he was doing. But they were not allowed to come together,
939987 [21312] though they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled, and
939987 [21313] tried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold him. She was
939987 [21314] seized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms to him, crying aloud as
939987 [21315] they carried her away. When the scene was over, he came to himself again,
939987 [21316] sitting in the same place as before, opposite the investigating lawyer,
939987 [21317] and crying out to them:
939987 [21318] 
939987 [21319] â€œWhat do you want with her? Why do you torment her? Sheâ€™s done nothing,
939987 [21320] nothing!...â€
939987 [21321] 
939987 [21322] The lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like this. At
939987 [21323] last Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into the
939987 [21324] room, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor:
939987 [21325] 
939987 [21326] â€œSheâ€™s been removed, sheâ€™s downstairs. Will you allow me to say one word
939987 [21327] to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in your
939987 [21328] presence.â€
939987 [21329] 
939987 [21330] â€œBy all means, Mihail Makarovitch,â€ answered the investigating lawyer. â€œIn
939987 [21331] the present case we have nothing against it.â€
939987 [21332] 
939987 [21333] â€œListen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,â€ began the police captain,
939987 [21334] and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the luckless
939987 [21335] prisoner on his excited face. â€œI took your Agrafena Alexandrovna
939987 [21336] downstairs myself, and confided her to the care of the landlordâ€™s
939987 [21337] daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her all the time. And I
939987 [21338] soothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed her. I impressed on her
939987 [21339] that you have to clear yourself, so she mustnâ€™t hinder you, must not
939987 [21340] depress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your
939987 [21341] evidence. In fact, I talked to her and she understood. Sheâ€™s a sensible
939987 [21342] girl, my boy, a good-hearted girl, she would have kissed my old hands,
939987 [21343] begging help for you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about
939987 [21344] her. And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you are
939987 [21345] calm and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?
939987 [21346] I was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you,
939987 [21347] sheâ€™s a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So what am I to tell
939987 [21348] her, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet or not?â€
939987 [21349] 
939987 [21350] The good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular, but
939987 [21351] Grushenkaâ€™s suffering, a fellow creatureâ€™s suffering, touched his
939987 [21352] good-natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped up and
939987 [21353] rushed towards him.
939987 [21354] 
939987 [21355] â€œForgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!â€ he cried. â€œYouâ€™ve the
939987 [21356] heart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her. I
939987 [21357] will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in the kindness of your
939987 [21358] heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be laughing in a
939987 [21359] minute, knowing that she has a guardian angel like you. I shall have done
939987 [21360] with all this directly, and as soon as Iâ€™m free, Iâ€™ll be with her, sheâ€™ll
939987 [21361] see, let her wait. Gentlemen,â€ he said, turning to the two lawyers, â€œnow
939987 [21362] Iâ€™ll open my whole soul to you; Iâ€™ll pour out everything. Weâ€™ll finish
939987 [21363] this off directly, finish it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end,
939987 [21364] shanâ€™t we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me
939987 [21365] tell you that. That one thing Iâ€™ll tell you now.... I see Iâ€™m with
939987 [21366] honorable men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you knew!
939987 [21367] Did you hear her cry, â€˜Iâ€™ll go to death with youâ€™? And what have I, a
939987 [21368] penniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for me? How can a clumsy,
939987 [21369] ugly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she is
939987 [21370] ready to go to exile with me? And how she fell down at your feet for my
939987 [21371] sake, just now!... and yet sheâ€™s proud and has done nothing! How can I
939987 [21372] help adoring her, how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did
939987 [21373] just now? Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.â€
939987 [21374] 
939987 [21375] And he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands, burst
939987 [21376] into tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered himself instantly. The
939987 [21377] old police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers also. They felt
939987 [21378] that the examination was passing into a new phase. When the police captain
939987 [21379] went out, Mitya was positively gay.
939987 [21380] 
939987 [21381] â€œNow, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal. And if
939987 [21382] it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand one
939987 [21383] another in a minute. Iâ€™m at those details again. Iâ€™m at your disposal,
939987 [21384] gentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in me
939987 [21385] and I in you, or thereâ€™ll be no end to it. I speak in your interests. To
939987 [21386] business, gentlemen, to business, and donâ€™t rummage in my soul; donâ€™t
939987 [21387] tease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what matters, and I
939987 [21388] will satisfy you at once. And damn the details!â€
939987 [21389] 
939987 [21390] So spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.
939987 [21391] 
939987 [21392] 
939987 [21393] 
939987 [21394] Chapter IV. The Second Ordeal
939987 [21395] 
939987 [21396] 
939987 [21397] â€œYou donâ€™t know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by your
939987 [21398] readiness to answer,â€ said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air, and
939987 [21399] obvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent, short-sighted, light
939987 [21400] gray eyes, from which he had removed his spectacles a moment before. â€œAnd
939987 [21401] you have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence, without
939987 [21402] which it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such
939987 [21403] importance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend
939987 [21404] himself and is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everything
939987 [21405] in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case.
939987 [21406] You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?â€ He turned to the prosecutor.
939987 [21407] 
939987 [21408] â€œOh, undoubtedly,â€ replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat cold,
939987 [21409] compared with Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s impulsiveness.
939987 [21410] 
939987 [21411] I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but lately
939987 [21412] arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit
939987 [21413] Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his bosom friend. He
939987 [21414] was almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit
939987 [21415] Kirillovitchâ€™s extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in
939987 [21416] the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him in Petersburg. On the
939987 [21417] other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the whole
939987 [21418] world whom our â€œunappreciatedâ€ prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to
939987 [21419] Mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case.
939987 [21420] And now as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and
939987 [21421] interpreted every indication on his senior colleagueâ€™s faceâ€”half a word, a
939987 [21422] glance, or a wink.
939987 [21423] 
939987 [21424] â€œGentlemen, only let me tell my own story and donâ€™t interrupt me with
939987 [21425] trivial questions and Iâ€™ll tell you everything in a moment,â€ said Mitya
939987 [21426] excitedly.
939987 [21427] 
939987 [21428] â€œExcellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your
939987 [21429] communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of
939987 [21430] great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at
939987 [21431] about five oâ€™clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend,
939987 [21432] Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.â€
939987 [21433] 
939987 [21434] â€œI pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more?
939987 [21435] Thatâ€™s all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.â€
939987 [21436] 
939987 [21437] â€œYou got back to town? Then you had been out of town?â€
939987 [21438] 
939987 [21439] â€œYes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didnâ€™t you know?â€
939987 [21440] 
939987 [21441] The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.
939987 [21442] 
939987 [21443] â€œWell, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic
939987 [21444] description of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards? Allow us,
939987 [21445] for instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and just when
939987 [21446] you left and when you came backâ€”all those facts.â€
939987 [21447] 
939987 [21448] â€œYou should have asked me like that from the beginning,â€ cried Mitya,
939987 [21449] laughing aloud, â€œand, if you like, we wonâ€™t begin from yesterday, but from
939987 [21450] the morning of the day before; then youâ€™ll understand how, why, and where
939987 [21451] I went. I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the
939987 [21452] town, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe
939987 [21453] security. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.â€
939987 [21454] 
939987 [21455] â€œAllow me to interrupt you,â€ the prosecutor put in politely. â€œWhy were you
939987 [21456] in such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?â€
939987 [21457] 
939987 [21458] â€œOh, gentlemen, you neednâ€™t go into details, how, when and why, and why
939987 [21459] just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole. Why, itâ€™ll
939987 [21460] run to three volumes, and then youâ€™ll want an epilogue!â€
939987 [21461] 
939987 [21462] Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of a
939987 [21463] man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best
939987 [21464] intentions.
939987 [21465] 
939987 [21466] â€œGentlemen!â€â€”he corrected himself hurriedlyâ€”â€œdonâ€™t be vexed with me for my
939987 [21467] restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more, I feel the greatest
939987 [21468] respect for you and understand the true position of affairs. Donâ€™t think
939987 [21469] Iâ€™m drunk. Iâ€™m quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk would be no
939987 [21470] hindrance. Itâ€™s with me, you know, like the saying: â€˜When he is sober, he
939987 [21471] is a fool; when he is drunk, he is a wise man.â€™ Ha ha! But I see,
939987 [21472] gentlemen, itâ€™s not the proper thing to make jokes to you, till weâ€™ve had
939987 [21473] our explanation, I mean. And Iâ€™ve my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite
939987 [21474] understand the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position
939987 [21475] of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And itâ€™s
939987 [21476] your business to watch me. I canâ€™t expect you to pat me on the head for
939987 [21477] what I did to Grigory, for one canâ€™t break old menâ€™s heads with impunity.
939987 [21478] I suppose youâ€™ll put me away for him for six months, or a year perhaps, in
939987 [21479] a house of correction. I donâ€™t know what the punishment isâ€”but it will be
939987 [21480] without loss of the rights of my rank, without loss of my rank, wonâ€™t it?
939987 [21481] So you see, gentlemen, I understand the distinction between us.... But you
939987 [21482] must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions. â€˜How did
939987 [21483] you step? Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did you
939987 [21484] step?â€™ I shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it
939987 [21485] all down against me. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even if
939987 [21486] itâ€™s nonsense Iâ€™m talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being
939987 [21487] men of honor and refinement, will forgive me! Iâ€™ll finish by asking you,
939987 [21488] gentlemen, to drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean,
939987 [21489] beginning from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for
939987 [21490] breakfast, how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention
939987 [21491] of the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, â€˜Whom
939987 [21492] did you murder? Whom did you rob?â€™ Ha ha! Thatâ€™s your regulation method,
939987 [21493] thatâ€™s where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off their
939987 [21494] guard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. Iâ€™ve been in the service,
939987 [21495] too. Ha ha ha! Youâ€™re not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?â€
939987 [21496] he cried, looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising.
939987 [21497] â€œItâ€™s only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would be
939987 [21498] inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!â€
939987 [21499] 
939987 [21500] Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the prosecutor did
939987 [21501] not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though anxious not
939987 [21502] to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the smallest twitch of
939987 [21503] any feature of his face.
939987 [21504] 
939987 [21505] â€œThatâ€™s how we have treated you from the beginning,â€ said Nikolay
939987 [21506] Parfenovitch, still laughing. â€œWe havenâ€™t tried to put you out by asking
939987 [21507] how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast. We began,
939987 [21508] indeed, with questions of the greatest importance.â€
939987 [21509] 
939987 [21510] â€œI understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still more
939987 [21511] your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of your
939987 [21512] noble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on the
939987 [21513] footing of mutual confidence between educated, well-bred people, who have
939987 [21514] the common bond of noble birth and honor. In any case, allow me to look
939987 [21515] upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when
939987 [21516] my honor is assailed. Thatâ€™s no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?â€
939987 [21517] 
939987 [21518] â€œOn the contrary. Youâ€™ve expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€
939987 [21519] Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.
939987 [21520] 
939987 [21521] â€œAnd enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those tricky
939987 [21522] questions!â€ cried Mitya enthusiastically. â€œOr thereâ€™s simply no knowing
939987 [21523] where we shall get to! Is there?â€
939987 [21524] 
939987 [21525] â€œI will follow your sensible advice entirely,â€ the prosecutor interposed,
939987 [21526] addressing Mitya. â€œI donâ€™t withdraw my question, however. It is now
939987 [21527] vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I mean
939987 [21528] precisely three thousand.â€
939987 [21529] 
939987 [21530] â€œWhy I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to pay
939987 [21531] a debt.â€
939987 [21532] 
939987 [21533] â€œA debt to whom?â€
939987 [21534] 
939987 [21535] â€œThat I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldnâ€™t, or
939987 [21536] because I shouldnâ€™t dare, or because it would be damaging, for itâ€™s all a
939987 [21537] paltry matter and absolutely trifling, butâ€”I wonâ€™t, because itâ€™s a matter
939987 [21538] of principle: thatâ€™s my private life, and I wonâ€™t allow any intrusion into
939987 [21539] my private life. Thatâ€™s my principle. Your question has no bearing on the
939987 [21540] case, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. I
939987 [21541] wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I wonâ€™t
939987 [21542] say.â€
939987 [21543] 
939987 [21544] â€œAllow me to make a note of that,â€ said the prosecutor.
939987 [21545] 
939987 [21546] â€œBy all means. Write down that I wonâ€™t say, that I wonâ€™t. Write that I
939987 [21547] should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; youâ€™ve nothing
939987 [21548] else to do with your time.â€
939987 [21549] 
939987 [21550] â€œAllow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are
939987 [21551] unaware of it,â€ the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern
939987 [21552] impressiveness, â€œthat you have a perfect right not to answer the questions
939987 [21553] put to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from
939987 [21554] you, if you decline to give it for one reason or another. That is entirely
939987 [21555] a matter for your personal decision. But it is our duty, on the other
939987 [21556] hand, in such cases as the present, to explain and set before you the
939987 [21557] degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or
939987 [21558] that piece of evidence. After which I will beg you to continue.â€
939987 [21559] 
939987 [21560] â€œGentlemen, Iâ€™m not angry ... I ...â€ Mitya muttered in a rather
939987 [21561] disconcerted tone. â€œWell, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I went
939987 [21562] then ...â€
939987 [21563] 
939987 [21564] We will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known to the
939987 [21565] reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest
939987 [21566] detail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over. But as he gave
939987 [21567] his evidence it was written down, and therefore they had continually to
939987 [21568] pull him up. Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though still
939987 [21569] good-humoredly. He did, it is true, exclaim, from time to time,
939987 [21570] â€œGentlemen, thatâ€™s enough to make an angel out of patience!â€ Or,
939987 [21571] â€œGentlemen, itâ€™s no good your irritating me.â€
939987 [21572] 
939987 [21573] But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially
939987 [21574] expansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two
939987 [21575] days before. (He had completely realized by now that he had been fooled.)
939987 [21576] The sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was
939987 [21577] something new to the lawyers. They were at once greatly interested, and
939987 [21578] even, to Mityaâ€™s intense indignation, thought it necessary to write the
939987 [21579] fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had
939987 [21580] hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began
939987 [21581] to grow surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the
939987 [21582] night spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to the
939987 [21583] town. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a minute
939987 [21584] account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenkaâ€™s account.
939987 [21585] 
939987 [21586] He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly into the
939987 [21587] circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevnaâ€™s house
939987 [21588] at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s garden to keep watch on Grushenka, and
939987 [21589] of Smerdyakovâ€™s bringing him information. They laid particular stress on
939987 [21590] this, and noted it down. Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length,
939987 [21591] and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to
939987 [21592] â€œpublic ignominy,â€ so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order
939987 [21593] to tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigating
939987 [21594] lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he told
939987 [21595] his story, disconcerted him at last considerably.
939987 [21596] 
939987 [21597] â€œThat boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense about
939987 [21598] women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my
939987 [21599] telling this to,â€ he reflected mournfully. â€œItâ€™s ignominious. â€˜Be patient,
939987 [21600] humble, hold thy peace.â€™ â€ He wound up his reflections with that line. But
939987 [21601] he pulled himself together to go on again. When he came to telling of his
939987 [21602] visit to Madame Hohlakov, he regained his spirits and even wished to tell
939987 [21603] a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case. But
939987 [21604] the investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he should
939987 [21605] pass on to â€œmore essential matters.â€ At last, when he described his
939987 [21606] despair and told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakovâ€™s, he thought that
939987 [21607] heâ€™d â€œget three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,â€ they
939987 [21608] stopped him again and noted down that he had â€œmeant to murder some one.â€
939987 [21609] Mitya let them write it without protest. At last he reached the point in
939987 [21610] his story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned
939987 [21611] from Samsonovâ€™s as soon as he left her there, though she had said that she
939987 [21612] would stay there till midnight.
939987 [21613] 
939987 [21614] â€œIf I didnâ€™t kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadnâ€™t
939987 [21615] time,â€ broke from him suddenly at that point in his story. That, too, was
939987 [21616] carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to tell
939987 [21617] how he ran into his fatherâ€™s garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly
939987 [21618] stopped him, and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him
939987 [21619] he brought out the brass pestle.
939987 [21620] 
939987 [21621] â€œDo you recognize this object?â€ he asked, showing it to Mitya.
939987 [21622] 
939987 [21623] â€œOh, yes,â€ he laughed gloomily. â€œOf course I recognize it. Let me have a
939987 [21624] look at it.... Damn it, never mind!â€
939987 [21625] 
939987 [21626] â€œYou have forgotten to mention it,â€ observed the investigating lawyer.
939987 [21627] 
939987 [21628] â€œHang it all, I shouldnâ€™t have concealed it from you. Do you suppose I
939987 [21629] could have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.â€
939987 [21630] 
939987 [21631] â€œBe so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it.â€
939987 [21632] 
939987 [21633] â€œCertainly I will be so good, gentlemen.â€
939987 [21634] 
939987 [21635] And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.
939987 [21636] 
939987 [21637] â€œBut what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon?â€
939987 [21638] 
939987 [21639] â€œWhat object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.â€
939987 [21640] 
939987 [21641] â€œWhat for, if you had no object?â€
939987 [21642] 
939987 [21643] Mityaâ€™s wrath flared up. He looked intently at â€œthe boyâ€ and smiled
939987 [21644] gloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more ashamed at having
939987 [21645] told â€œsuch peopleâ€ the story of his jealousy so sincerely and
939987 [21646] spontaneously.
939987 [21647] 
939987 [21648] â€œBother the pestle!â€ broke from him suddenly.
939987 [21649] 
939987 [21650] â€œBut stillâ€”â€
939987 [21651] 
939987 [21652] â€œOh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything
939987 [21653] turned up.â€
939987 [21654] 
939987 [21655] â€œBut have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you
939987 [21656] went out, since youâ€™re afraid of the dark?â€
939987 [21657] 
939987 [21658] â€œUgh! damn it all, gentlemen! Thereâ€™s positively no talking to you!â€ cried
939987 [21659] Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimson
939987 [21660] with anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in his voice:
939987 [21661] 
939987 [21662] â€œWrite down at once ... at once ... â€˜that I snatched up the pestle to go
939987 [21663] and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head
939987 [21664] with it!â€™ Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your minds
939987 [21665] relieved?â€ he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers.
939987 [21666] 
939987 [21667] â€œWe quite understand that you made that statement just now through
939987 [21668] exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consider
939987 [21669] trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,â€ the prosecutor remarked
939987 [21670] dryly in reply.
939987 [21671] 
939987 [21672] â€œWell, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does one
939987 [21673] pick things up for at such moments? I donâ€™t know what for. I snatched it
939987 [21674] up and ranâ€”thatâ€™s all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or I declare I
939987 [21675] wonâ€™t tell you any more.â€
939987 [21676] 
939987 [21677] He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He sat
939987 [21678] sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of
939987 [21679] nausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare that
939987 [21680] he wouldnâ€™t say another word, â€œnot if you hang me for it.â€
939987 [21681] 
939987 [21682] â€œYou see, gentlemen,â€ he said at last, with difficulty controlling
939987 [21683] himself, â€œyou see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... Itâ€™s a
939987 [21684] dream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream itâ€”itâ€™s always the same
939987 [21685] ... that some one is hunting me, some one Iâ€™m awfully afraid of ... that
939987 [21686] heâ€™s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hide
939987 [21687] somewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way,
939987 [21688] and the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but he pretends not to
939987 [21689] know where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror....
939987 [21690] Thatâ€™s just what youâ€™re doing now. Itâ€™s just like that!â€
939987 [21691] 
939987 [21692] â€œIs that the sort of thing you dream about?â€ inquired the prosecutor.
939987 [21693] 
939987 [21694] â€œYes, it is. Donâ€™t you want to write it down?â€ said Mitya, with a
939987 [21695] distorted smile.
939987 [21696] 
939987 [21697] â€œNo; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.â€
939987 [21698] 
939987 [21699] â€œItâ€™s not a question of dreams now, gentlemenâ€”this is realism, this is
939987 [21700] real life! Iâ€™m a wolf and youâ€™re the hunters. Well, hunt him down!â€
939987 [21701] 
939987 [21702] â€œYou are wrong to make such comparisons ...â€ began Nikolay Parfenovitch,
939987 [21703] with extraordinary softness.
939987 [21704] 
939987 [21705] â€œNo, Iâ€™m not wrong, not at all!â€ Mitya flared up again, though his
939987 [21706] outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more
939987 [21707] good-humored at every word. â€œYou may not trust a criminal or a man on
939987 [21708] trial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable
939987 [21709] impulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)â€”no! That you must believe you
939987 [21710] have no right indeed ... butâ€”
939987 [21711] 
939987 [21712] 
939987 [21713]     Be silent, heart,
939987 [21714]     Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.
939987 [21715] 
939987 [21716] 
939987 [21717] Well, shall I go on?â€ he broke off gloomily.
939987 [21718] 
939987 [21719] â€œIf youâ€™ll be so kind,â€ answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [21720] 
939987 [21721] 
939987 [21722] 
939987 [21723] Chapter V. The Third Ordeal
939987 [21724] 
939987 [21725] 
939987 [21726] Though Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying more than
939987 [21727] ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story. He told them how
939987 [21728] he had leapt over the fence into his fatherâ€™s garden; how he had gone up
939987 [21729] to the window; told them all that had passed under the window. Clearly,
939987 [21730] precisely, distinctly, he described the feelings that troubled him during
939987 [21731] those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether
939987 [21732] Grushenka was with his father or not. But, strange to say, both the
939987 [21733] lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him,
939987 [21734] asked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their faces.
939987 [21735] 
939987 [21736] â€œTheyâ€™re angry and offended,â€ he thought. â€œWell, bother them!â€
939987 [21737] 
939987 [21738] When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the â€œsignalâ€ to
939987 [21739] his father that Grushenka had come, so that he should open the window, the
939987 [21740] lawyers paid no attention to the word â€œsignal,â€ as though they entirely
939987 [21741] failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection: so much so,
939987 [21742] that Mitya noticed it. Coming at last to the moment when, seeing his
939987 [21743] father peering out of the window, his hatred flared up and he pulled the
939987 [21744] pestle out of his pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short.
939987 [21745] He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon
939987 [21746] him.
939987 [21747] 
939987 [21748] â€œWell?â€ said the investigating lawyer. â€œYou pulled out the weapon and ...
939987 [21749] and what happened then?â€
939987 [21750] 
939987 [21751] â€œThen? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his
939987 [21752] skull.... I suppose thatâ€™s your story. Thatâ€™s it!â€
939987 [21753] 
939987 [21754] His eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with
939987 [21755] extraordinary violence in his soul.
939987 [21756] 
939987 [21757] â€œOur story?â€ repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. â€œWellâ€”and yours?â€
939987 [21758] 
939987 [21759] Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.
939987 [21760] 
939987 [21761] â€œMy story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,â€ he began softly. â€œWhether
939987 [21762] it was some oneâ€™s tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angel
939987 [21763] kissed me at that instant, I donâ€™t know. But the devil was conquered. I
939987 [21764] rushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was alarmed and,
939987 [21765] for the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang back from the
939987 [21766] window. I remember that very well. I ran across the garden to the fence
939987 [21767] ... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.â€
939987 [21768] 
939987 [21769] At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners. They
939987 [21770] seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention. A sort of
939987 [21771] paroxysm of indignation seized on Mityaâ€™s soul.
939987 [21772] 
939987 [21773] â€œWhy, youâ€™re laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!â€ he broke off
939987 [21774] suddenly.
939987 [21775] 
939987 [21776] â€œWhat makes you think that?â€ observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [21777] 
939987 [21778] â€œYou donâ€™t believe one wordâ€”thatâ€™s why! I understand, of course, that I
939987 [21779] have come to the vital point. The old manâ€™s lying there now with his skull
939987 [21780] broken, while Iâ€”after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him,
939987 [21781] and how I snatched up the pestleâ€”I suddenly run away from the window. A
939987 [21782] romance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha!
939987 [21783] You are scoffers, gentlemen!â€
939987 [21784] 
939987 [21785] And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.
939987 [21786] 
939987 [21787] â€œAnd did you notice,â€ asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not
939987 [21788] observing Mityaâ€™s excitement, â€œdid you notice when you ran away from the
939987 [21789] window, whether the door into the garden was open?â€
939987 [21790] 
939987 [21791] â€œNo, it was not open.â€
939987 [21792] 
939987 [21793] â€œIt was not?â€
939987 [21794] 
939987 [21795] â€œIt was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!â€ he seemed
939987 [21796] suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:
939987 [21797] 
939987 [21798] â€œWhy, did you find the door open?â€
939987 [21799] 
939987 [21800] â€œYes, it was open.â€
939987 [21801] 
939987 [21802] â€œWhy, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?â€ cried
939987 [21803] Mitya, greatly astonished.
939987 [21804] 
939987 [21805] â€œThe door stood open, and your fatherâ€™s murderer undoubtedly went in at
939987 [21806] that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same
939987 [21807] door,â€ the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out
939987 [21808] each word separately. â€œThat is perfectly clear. The murder was committed
939987 [21809] in the room and _not through the __ window_; that is absolutely certain
939987 [21810] from the examination that has been made, from the position of the body and
939987 [21811] everything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.â€
939987 [21812] 
939987 [21813] Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded.
939987 [21814] 
939987 [21815] â€œBut thatâ€™s utterly impossible!â€ he cried, completely at a loss. â€œI ... I
939987 [21816] didnâ€™t go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut the
939987 [21817] whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden. I only
939987 [21818] stood at the window and saw him through the window. Thatâ€™s all, thatâ€™s
939987 [21819] all.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didnâ€™t remember, it would
939987 [21820] be just the same. I know it, for no one knew the signals except
939987 [21821] Smerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he wouldnâ€™t have opened the door
939987 [21822] to any one in the world without the signals.â€
939987 [21823] 
939987 [21824] â€œSignals? What signals?â€ asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almost
939987 [21825] hysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and
939987 [21826] dignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. He
939987 [21827] scented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and was already
939987 [21828] filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.
939987 [21829] 
939987 [21830] â€œSo you didnâ€™t know!â€ Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking
939987 [21831] smile. â€œWhat if I wonâ€™t tell you? From whom could you find out? No one
939987 [21832] knew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was all.
939987 [21833] Heaven knew, too, but it wonâ€™t tell you. But itâ€™s an interesting fact.
939987 [21834] Thereâ€™s no knowing what you might build on it. Ha ha! Take comfort,
939987 [21835] gentlemen, Iâ€™ll reveal it. Youâ€™ve some foolish idea in your hearts. You
939987 [21836] donâ€™t know the man you have to deal with! You have to do with a prisoner
939987 [21837] who gives evidence against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for Iâ€™m a man
939987 [21838] of honor and youâ€”are not.â€
939987 [21839] 
939987 [21840] The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling with
939987 [21841] impatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them
939987 [21842] everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov.
939987 [21843] He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant, tapped the
939987 [21844] signals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed
939987 [21845] he, Mitya, had tapped the signal â€œGrushenka has come,â€ when he tapped to
939987 [21846] his father, he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal, that
939987 [21847] â€œGrushenka had come.â€
939987 [21848] 
939987 [21849] â€œSo now you can build up your tower,â€ Mitya broke off, and again turned
939987 [21850] away from them contemptuously.
939987 [21851] 
939987 [21852] â€œSo no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valet
939987 [21853] Smerdyakov? And no one else?â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more.
939987 [21854] 
939987 [21855] â€œYes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven. That may
939987 [21856] be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.â€
939987 [21857] 
939987 [21858] And they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But while they
939987 [21859] wrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea:
939987 [21860] 
939987 [21861] â€œBut if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all
939987 [21862] responsibility for the death of your father, was it not he, perhaps, who
939987 [21863] knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to open to him, and
939987 [21864] then ... committed the crime?â€
939987 [21865] 
939987 [21866] Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred. His
939987 [21867] silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink.
939987 [21868] 
939987 [21869] â€œYouâ€™ve caught the fox again,â€ commented Mitya at last; â€œyouâ€™ve got the
939987 [21870] beast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought,
939987 [21871] of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout
939987 [21872] with all my might, â€˜Aie! itâ€™s Smerdyakov; heâ€™s the murderer.â€™ Confess
939987 [21873] thatâ€™s what you thought. Confess, and Iâ€™ll go on.â€
939987 [21874] 
939987 [21875] But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited.
939987 [21876] 
939987 [21877] â€œYouâ€™re mistaken. Iâ€™m not going to shout â€˜Itâ€™s Smerdyakov,â€™ â€ said Mitya.
939987 [21878] 
939987 [21879] â€œAnd you donâ€™t even suspect him?â€
939987 [21880] 
939987 [21881] â€œWhy, do you suspect him?â€
939987 [21882] 
939987 [21883] â€œHe is suspected, too.â€
939987 [21884] 
939987 [21885] Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor.
939987 [21886] 
939987 [21887] â€œJoking apart,â€ he brought out gloomily. â€œListen. From the very beginning,
939987 [21888] almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, Iâ€™ve
939987 [21889] had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. Iâ€™ve been sitting here, shouting
939987 [21890] that Iâ€™m innocent and thinking all the time â€˜Smerdyakov!â€™ I canâ€™t get
939987 [21891] Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just
939987 [21892] now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, â€˜No, itâ€™s not
939987 [21893] Smerdyakov.â€™ Itâ€™s not his doing, gentlemen.â€
939987 [21894] 
939987 [21895] â€œIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch
939987 [21896] inquired cautiously.
939987 [21897] 
939987 [21898] â€œI donâ€™t know any one it could be, whether itâ€™s the hand of Heaven or
939987 [21899] Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,â€ Mitya jerked out with decision.
939987 [21900] 
939987 [21901] â€œBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that itâ€™s not
939987 [21902] he?â€
939987 [21903] 
939987 [21904] â€œFrom my convictionâ€”my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most
939987 [21905] abject character and a coward. Heâ€™s not a coward, heâ€™s the epitome of all
939987 [21906] the cowardice in the world walking on two legs. He has the heart of a
939987 [21907] chicken. When he talked to me, he was always trembling for fear I should
939987 [21908] kill him, though I never raised my hand against him. He fell at my feet
939987 [21909] and blubbered; he has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching me
939987 [21910] â€˜not to frighten him.â€™ Do you hear? â€˜Not to frighten him.â€™ What a thing to
939987 [21911] say! Why, I offered him money. Heâ€™s a puling chickenâ€”sickly, epileptic,
939987 [21912] weak-mindedâ€”a child of eight could thrash him. He has no character worth
939987 [21913] talking about. Itâ€™s not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He doesnâ€™t care for money;
939987 [21914] he wouldnâ€™t take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for murdering
939987 [21915] the old man? Why, heâ€™s very likely his son, you knowâ€”his natural son. Do
939987 [21916] you know that?â€
939987 [21917] 
939987 [21918] â€œWe have heard that legend. But you are your fatherâ€™s son, too, you know;
939987 [21919] yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him.â€
939987 [21920] 
939987 [21921] â€œThatâ€™s a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! Iâ€™m not afraid! Oh,
939987 [21922] gentlemen, isnâ€™t it too base of you to say that to my face? Itâ€™s base,
939987 [21923] because I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him, but I
939987 [21924] might have done it. And, whatâ€™s more, I went out of my way to tell you of
939987 [21925] my own accord that I nearly murdered him. But, you see, I didnâ€™t murder
939987 [21926] him; you see, my guardian angel saved meâ€”thatâ€™s what youâ€™ve not taken into
939987 [21927] account. And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so base of you. For I didnâ€™t kill him, I
939987 [21928] didnâ€™t kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.â€
939987 [21929] 
939987 [21930] He was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during the whole
939987 [21931] interrogation.
939987 [21932] 
939987 [21933] â€œAnd what has he told you, gentlemenâ€”Smerdyakov, I mean?â€ he added
939987 [21934] suddenly, after a pause. â€œMay I ask that question?â€
939987 [21935] 
939987 [21936] â€œYou may ask any question,â€ the prosecutor replied with frigid severity,
939987 [21937] â€œany question relating to the facts of the case, and we are, I repeat,
939987 [21938] bound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the servant Smerdyakov,
939987 [21939] concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his bed, in an epileptic
939987 [21940] fit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly, ten times. The
939987 [21941] doctor who was with us told us, after seeing him, that he may possibly not
939987 [21942] outlive the night.â€
939987 [21943] 
939987 [21944] â€œWell, if thatâ€™s so, the devil must have killed him,â€ broke suddenly from
939987 [21945] Mitya, as though until that moment he had been asking himself: â€œWas it
939987 [21946] Smerdyakov or not?â€
939987 [21947] 
939987 [21948] â€œWe will come back to this later,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch decided. â€œNow,
939987 [21949] wouldnâ€™t you like to continue your statement?â€
939987 [21950] 
939987 [21951] Mitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted. After
939987 [21952] resting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed. He was
939987 [21953] exhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse the
939987 [21954] prosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally, by vexatious
939987 [21955] interruptions about â€œtrifling points.â€ Scarcely had Mitya described how,
939987 [21956] sitting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle,
939987 [21957] while the old man had hold of his left leg, and how he had then jumped
939987 [21958] down to look at him, when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to
939987 [21959] describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was surprised.
939987 [21960] 
939987 [21961] â€œOh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall and
939987 [21962] one on the other.â€
939987 [21963] 
939987 [21964] â€œAnd the pestle?â€
939987 [21965] 
939987 [21966] â€œThe pestle was in my hand.â€
939987 [21967] 
939987 [21968] â€œNot in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent blow
939987 [21969] you gave him?â€
939987 [21970] 
939987 [21971] â€œIt must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?â€
939987 [21972] 
939987 [21973] â€œWould you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and
939987 [21974] showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?â€
939987 [21975] 
939987 [21976] â€œYouâ€™re making fun of me, arenâ€™t you?â€ asked Mitya, looking haughtily at
939987 [21977] the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.
939987 [21978] 
939987 [21979] Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm.
939987 [21980] 
939987 [21981] â€œThis was how I struck him! Thatâ€™s how I knocked him down! What more do
939987 [21982] you want?â€
939987 [21983] 
939987 [21984] â€œThank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with
939987 [21985] what object, and what you had in view?â€
939987 [21986] 
939987 [21987] â€œOh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man Iâ€™d hurt ... I donâ€™t
939987 [21988] know what for!â€
939987 [21989] 
939987 [21990] â€œThough you were so excited and were running away?â€
939987 [21991] 
939987 [21992] â€œYes, though I was excited and running away.â€
939987 [21993] 
939987 [21994] â€œYou wanted to help him?â€
939987 [21995] 
939987 [21996] â€œHelp!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I donâ€™t remember.â€
939987 [21997] 
939987 [21998] â€œYou donâ€™t remember? Then you didnâ€™t quite know what you were doing?â€
939987 [21999] 
939987 [22000] â€œNot at all. I remember everythingâ€”every detail. I jumped down to look at
939987 [22001] him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.â€
939987 [22002] 
939987 [22003] â€œWe have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to
939987 [22004] consciousness?â€
939987 [22005] 
939987 [22006] â€œI donâ€™t know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure whether he
939987 [22007] was alive or not.â€
939987 [22008] 
939987 [22009] â€œAh! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?â€
939987 [22010] 
939987 [22011] â€œIâ€™m not a doctor. I couldnâ€™t decide. I ran away thinking Iâ€™d killed him.
939987 [22012] And now heâ€™s recovered.â€
939987 [22013] 
939987 [22014] â€œExcellent,â€ commented the prosecutor. â€œThank you. Thatâ€™s all I wanted.
939987 [22015] Kindly proceed.â€
939987 [22016] 
939987 [22017] Alas! it never entered Mityaâ€™s head to tell them, though he remembered it,
939987 [22018] that he had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate figure
939987 [22019] had even uttered some words of regret: â€œYouâ€™ve come to grief, old
939987 [22020] manâ€”thereâ€™s no help for it. Well, there you must lie.â€
939987 [22021] 
939987 [22022] The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumped
939987 [22023] back â€œat such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of
939987 [22024] ascertaining whether the _only_ witness of his crime were dead; that he
939987 [22025] must therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision and
939987 [22026] foresight even at such a moment,â€ ... and so on. The prosecutor was
939987 [22027] satisfied: â€œIâ€™ve provoked the nervous fellow by â€˜triflesâ€™ and he has said
939987 [22028] more than he meant to.â€
939987 [22029] 
939987 [22030] With painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled up
939987 [22031] immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22032] 
939987 [22033] â€œHow came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands so
939987 [22034] covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?â€
939987 [22035] 
939987 [22036] â€œWhy, I didnâ€™t notice the blood at all at the time,â€ answered Mitya.
939987 [22037] 
939987 [22038] â€œThatâ€™s quite likely. It does happen sometimes.â€ The prosecutor exchanged
939987 [22039] glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22040] 
939987 [22041] â€œI simply didnâ€™t notice. Youâ€™re quite right there, prosecutor,â€ Mitya
939987 [22042] assented suddenly.
939987 [22043] 
939987 [22044] Next came the account of Mityaâ€™s sudden determination to â€œstep asideâ€ and
939987 [22045] make way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to open
939987 [22046] his heart to them as before, and tell them about â€œthe queen of his soul.â€
939987 [22047] He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons â€œwho were
939987 [22048] fastening on him like bugs.â€ And so in response to their reiterated
939987 [22049] questions he answered briefly and abruptly:
939987 [22050] 
939987 [22051] â€œWell, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for? That
939987 [22052] question stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come back,
939987 [22053] the man who wronged her but whoâ€™d hurried back to offer his love, after
939987 [22054] five years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew it was all
939987 [22055] over for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that bloodâ€”Grigoryâ€™s.... What
939987 [22056] had I to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load
939987 [22057] them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.â€
939987 [22058] 
939987 [22059] â€œAnd a grand feast the night before?â€
939987 [22060] 
939987 [22061] â€œYes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make
939987 [22062] haste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the
939987 [22063] village, and Iâ€™d planned to do it at five oâ€™clock in the morning. And I
939987 [22064] had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotinâ€™s when I loaded my
939987 [22065] pistols. Hereâ€™s the letter. Read it! Itâ€™s not for you I tell it,â€ he added
939987 [22066] contemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the
939987 [22067] table. The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to
939987 [22068] the papers connected with the case.
939987 [22069] 
939987 [22070] â€œAnd you didnâ€™t even think of washing your hands at Perhotinâ€™s? You were
939987 [22071] not afraid then of arousing suspicion?â€
939987 [22072] 
939987 [22073] â€œWhat suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just the
939987 [22074] same, and shot myself at five oâ€™clock, and you wouldnâ€™t have been in time
939987 [22075] to do anything. If it hadnâ€™t been for whatâ€™s happened to my father, you
939987 [22076] would have known nothing about it, and wouldnâ€™t have come here. Oh, itâ€™s
939987 [22077] the devilâ€™s doing. It was the devil murdered father, it was through the
939987 [22078] devil that you found it out so soon. How did you manage to get here so
939987 [22079] quick? Itâ€™s marvelous, a dream!â€
939987 [22080] 
939987 [22081] â€œMr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in your
939987 [22082] hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a
939987 [22083] bundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his servant-boy saw it too.â€
939987 [22084] 
939987 [22085] â€œThatâ€™s true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.â€
939987 [22086] 
939987 [22087] â€œNow, thereâ€™s one little point presents itself. Can you inform us,â€
939987 [22088] Nikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, â€œwhere did you get so
939987 [22089] much money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from the
939987 [22090] reckoning of time, that you had not been home?â€
939987 [22091] 
939987 [22092] The prosecutorâ€™s brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly,
939987 [22093] but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22094] 
939987 [22095] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t go home,â€ answered Mitya, apparently perfectly composed, but
939987 [22096] looking at the floor.
939987 [22097] 
939987 [22098] â€œAllow me then to repeat my question,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as
939987 [22099] though creeping up to the subject. â€œWhere were you able to procure such a
939987 [22100] sum all at once, when by your own confession, at five oâ€™clock the same day
939987 [22101] youâ€”â€
939987 [22102] 
939987 [22103] â€œI was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin, and
939987 [22104] then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she wouldnâ€™t
939987 [22105] give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,â€ Mitya interrupted sharply.
939987 [22106] â€œYes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands turned up,
939987 [22107] eh? Do you know, gentlemen, youâ€™re both afraid now â€˜what if he wonâ€™t tell
939987 [22108] us where he got it?â€™ Thatâ€™s just how it is. Iâ€™m not going to tell you,
939987 [22109] gentlemen. Youâ€™ve guessed right. Youâ€™ll never know,â€ said Mitya, chipping
939987 [22110] out each word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent
939987 [22111] for a moment.
939987 [22112] 
939987 [22113] â€œYou must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for us
939987 [22114] to know,â€ said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.
939987 [22115] 
939987 [22116] â€œI understand; but still I wonâ€™t tell you.â€
939987 [22117] 
939987 [22118] The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that he
939987 [22119] was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it to his
939987 [22120] interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do himself by his
939987 [22121] silence, especially in a case of such importance asâ€”
939987 [22122] 
939987 [22123] â€œAnd so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! Iâ€™ve heard that rigmarole
939987 [22124] before,â€ Mitya interrupted again. â€œI can see for myself how important it
939987 [22125] is, and that this is the vital point, and still I wonâ€™t say.â€
939987 [22126] 
939987 [22127] â€œWhat is it to us? Itâ€™s not our business, but yours. You are doing
939987 [22128] yourself harm,â€ observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.
939987 [22129] 
939987 [22130] â€œYou see, gentlemen, joking apartâ€â€”Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly
939987 [22131] at them bothâ€”â€œI had an inkling from the first that we should come to
939987 [22132] loggerheads at this point. But at first when I began to give my evidence,
939987 [22133] it was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and I was so
939987 [22134] simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing
939987 [22135] between us. Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the
939987 [22136] question, for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed
939987 [22137] stumbling-block. And now weâ€™ve come to it! Itâ€™s impossible and thereâ€™s an
939987 [22138] end of it! But I donâ€™t blame you. You canâ€™t believe it all simply on my
939987 [22139] word. I understand that, of course.â€
939987 [22140] 
939987 [22141] He relapsed into gloomy silence.
939987 [22142] 
939987 [22143] â€œCouldnâ€™t you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the
939987 [22144] chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight hint as
939987 [22145] to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to
939987 [22146] refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?â€
939987 [22147] 
939987 [22148] Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.
939987 [22149] 
939987 [22150] â€œIâ€™m much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. Iâ€™ll tell you the
939987 [22151] reason why and give you that hint, though you donâ€™t deserve it. I wonâ€™t
939987 [22152] speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my honor. The
939987 [22153] answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far
939987 [22154] greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I had
939987 [22155] murdered and robbed him. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t tell you. I canâ€™t for fear of
939987 [22156] disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?â€
939987 [22157] 
939987 [22158] â€œYes, weâ€™ll write it down,â€ lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22159] 
939987 [22160] â€œYou ought not to write that down about â€˜disgrace.â€™ I only told you that
939987 [22161] in the goodness of my heart. I neednâ€™t have told you. I made you a present
939987 [22162] of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once. Oh, well, writeâ€”write
939987 [22163] what you like,â€ he concluded, with scornful disgust. â€œIâ€™m not afraid of
939987 [22164] you and I can still hold up my head before you.â€
939987 [22165] 
939987 [22166] â€œAnd canâ€™t you tell us the nature of that disgrace?â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch
939987 [22167] hazarded.
939987 [22168] 
939987 [22169] The prosecutor frowned darkly.
939987 [22170] 
939987 [22171] â€œNo, no, _câ€™est fini_, donâ€™t trouble yourselves. Itâ€™s not worth while
939987 [22172] soiling oneâ€™s hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.
939987 [22173] Youâ€™re not worth itâ€”no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. Iâ€™m not going on.â€
939987 [22174] 
939987 [22175] This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist
939987 [22176] further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitchâ€™s eyes he saw that he had not given
939987 [22177] up hope.
939987 [22178] 
939987 [22179] â€œCan you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when you
939987 [22180] went into Mr. Perhotinâ€™sâ€”how many roubles exactly?â€
939987 [22181] 
939987 [22182] â€œI canâ€™t tell you that.â€
939987 [22183] 
939987 [22184] â€œYou spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three thousand
939987 [22185] from Madame Hohlakov.â€
939987 [22186] 
939987 [22187] â€œPerhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I wonâ€™t say how much I had.â€
939987 [22188] 
939987 [22189] â€œWill you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you
939987 [22190] have done since you arrived?â€
939987 [22191] 
939987 [22192] â€œOh! you might ask the people here about that. But Iâ€™ll tell you if you
939987 [22193] like.â€
939987 [22194] 
939987 [22195] He proceeded to do so, but we wonâ€™t repeat his story. He told it dryly and
939987 [22196] curtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but told them that he
939987 [22197] abandoned his determination to shoot himself, owing to â€œnew factors in the
939987 [22198] case.â€ He told the story without going into motives or details. And this
939987 [22199] time the lawyers did not worry him much. It was obvious that there was no
939987 [22200] essential point of interest to them here.
939987 [22201] 
939987 [22202] â€œWe shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the examination
939987 [22203] of the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your presence,â€
939987 [22204] said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. â€œAnd now allow me to request you
939987 [22205] to lay on the table everything in your possession, especially all the
939987 [22206] money you still have about you.â€
939987 [22207] 
939987 [22208] â€œMy money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary. Iâ€™m
939987 [22209] surprised, indeed, that you havenâ€™t inquired about it before. Itâ€™s true I
939987 [22210] couldnâ€™t get away anywhere. Iâ€™m sitting here where I can be seen. But
939987 [22211] hereâ€™s my moneyâ€”count itâ€”take it. Thatâ€™s all, I think.â€
939987 [22212] 
939987 [22213] He turned it all out of his pockets; even the small changeâ€”two pieces of
939987 [22214] twenty copecksâ€”he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket. They counted the
939987 [22215] money, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles, and forty
939987 [22216] copecks.
939987 [22217] 
939987 [22218] â€œAnd is that all?â€ asked the investigating lawyer.
939987 [22219] 
939987 [22220] â€œYes.â€
939987 [22221] 
939987 [22222] â€œYou stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles
939987 [22223] at Plotnikovsâ€™. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver twenty, here you lost
939987 [22224] two hundred, then....â€
939987 [22225] 
939987 [22226] Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily. They
939987 [22227] recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. Nikolay
939987 [22228] Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.
939987 [22229] 
939987 [22230] â€œWith this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at
939987 [22231] first?â€
939987 [22232] 
939987 [22233] â€œI suppose so,â€ snapped Mitya.
939987 [22234] 
939987 [22235] â€œHow is it they all assert there was much more?â€
939987 [22236] 
939987 [22237] â€œLet them assert it.â€
939987 [22238] 
939987 [22239] â€œBut you asserted it yourself.â€
939987 [22240] 
939987 [22241] â€œYes, I did, too.â€
939987 [22242] 
939987 [22243] â€œWe will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet
939987 [22244] examined. Donâ€™t be anxious about your money. It will be properly taken
939987 [22245] care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning
939987 [22246] ... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved that you have undisputed
939987 [22247] right to it. Well, and now....â€
939987 [22248] 
939987 [22249] Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly that it
939987 [22250] was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search â€œof
939987 [22251] your clothes and everything else....â€
939987 [22252] 
939987 [22253] â€œBy all means, gentlemen. Iâ€™ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.â€
939987 [22254] 
939987 [22255] And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.
939987 [22256] 
939987 [22257] â€œIt will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.â€
939987 [22258] 
939987 [22259] â€œWhat! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Wonâ€™t you search me as I am! Canâ€™t you?â€
939987 [22260] 
939987 [22261] â€œItâ€™s utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take off your
939987 [22262] clothes.â€
939987 [22263] 
939987 [22264] â€œAs you like,â€ Mitya submitted gloomily; â€œonly, please, not here, but
939987 [22265] behind the curtains. Who will search them?â€
939987 [22266] 
939987 [22267] â€œBehind the curtains, of course.â€
939987 [22268] 
939987 [22269] Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore an
939987 [22270] expression of peculiar solemnity.
939987 [22271] 
939987 [22272] 
939987 [22273] 
939987 [22274] Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya
939987 [22275] 
939987 [22276] 
939987 [22277] Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could
939987 [22278] never, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like
939987 [22279] that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was something
939987 [22280] humiliating in it, and on their side something â€œsupercilious and
939987 [22281] scornful.â€ It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to
939987 [22282] undress further, or rather not asked but â€œcommanded,â€ he quite understood
939987 [22283] that. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Several
939987 [22284] peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the
939987 [22285] curtain. â€œTo be ready if force is required,â€ thought Mitya, â€œand perhaps
939987 [22286] for some other reason, too.â€
939987 [22287] 
939987 [22288] â€œWell, must I take off my shirt, too?â€ he asked sharply, but Nikolay
939987 [22289] Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in
939987 [22290] examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was
939987 [22291] evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. â€œThey make no
939987 [22292] bones about it,â€ thought Mitya, â€œthey donâ€™t keep up the most elementary
939987 [22293] politeness.â€
939987 [22294] 
939987 [22295] â€œI ask you for the second timeâ€”need I take off my shirt or not?â€ he said,
939987 [22296] still more sharply and irritably.
939987 [22297] 
939987 [22298] â€œDonâ€™t trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,â€ Nikolay
939987 [22299] Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it
939987 [22300] seemed to Mitya.
939987 [22301] 
939987 [22302] Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.
939987 [22303] There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the
939987 [22304] back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were bloodstains
939987 [22305] on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence of
939987 [22306] the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and
939987 [22307] all the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking for
939987 [22308] somethingâ€”money, of course. He didnâ€™t even hide from Mitya his suspicion
939987 [22309] that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes.
939987 [22310] 
939987 [22311] â€œHe treats me not as an officer but as a thief,â€ Mitya muttered to
939987 [22312] himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing
939987 [22313] frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain,
939987 [22314] fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s attention to
939987 [22315] the cap, which they were also fingering.
939987 [22316] 
939987 [22317] â€œYou remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,â€ observed the secretary. â€œLast
939987 [22318] summer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to have
939987 [22319] lost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why, in just
939987 [22320] such pipings in his cap. The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in
939987 [22321] little rolls and sewed in the piping.â€
939987 [22322] 
939987 [22323] Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenkoâ€™s case perfectly, and so laid aside
939987 [22324] Mityaâ€™s cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly
939987 [22325] examined later.
939987 [22326] 
939987 [22327] â€œExcuse me,â€ cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the right
939987 [22328] cuff of Mityaâ€™s shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, â€œexcuse me,
939987 [22329] whatâ€™s that, blood?â€
939987 [22330] 
939987 [22331] â€œYes,â€ Mitya jerked out.
939987 [22332] 
939987 [22333] â€œThat is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?â€
939987 [22334] 
939987 [22335] Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after
939987 [22336] Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at
939987 [22337] Perhotinâ€™s.
939987 [22338] 
939987 [22339] â€œYou must take off your shirt, too. Thatâ€™s very important as material
939987 [22340] evidence.â€
939987 [22341] 
939987 [22342] Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.
939987 [22343] 
939987 [22344] â€œWhat, am I to stay naked?â€ he shouted.
939987 [22345] 
939987 [22346] â€œDonâ€™t disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take off
939987 [22347] your socks.â€
939987 [22348] 
939987 [22349] â€œYouâ€™re not joking? Is that really necessary?â€ Mityaâ€™s eyes flashed.
939987 [22350] 
939987 [22351] â€œWe are in no mood for joking,â€ answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.
939987 [22352] 
939987 [22353] â€œWell, if I mustâ€”â€ muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he took
939987 [22354] off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he was
939987 [22355] naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in
939987 [22356] their presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he was
939987 [22357] inferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him.
939987 [22358] 
939987 [22359] â€œWhen all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when oneâ€™s the
939987 [22360] only one undressed and everybody is looking, itâ€™s degrading,â€ he kept
939987 [22361] repeating to himself, again and again. â€œItâ€™s like a dream, Iâ€™ve sometimes
939987 [22362] dreamed of being in such degrading positions.â€ It was a misery to him to
939987 [22363] take off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were his underclothes,
939987 [22364] and now every one could see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet.
939987 [22365] All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularly
939987 [22366] loathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they
939987 [22367] would all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and
939987 [22368] intentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.
939987 [22369] 
939987 [22370] â€œWould you like to look anywhere else if youâ€™re not ashamed to?â€
939987 [22371] 
939987 [22372] â€œNo, thereâ€™s no need to, at present.â€
939987 [22373] 
939987 [22374] â€œWell, am I to stay naked like this?â€ he added savagely.
939987 [22375] 
939987 [22376] â€œYes, that canâ€™t be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a
939987 [22377] while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... Iâ€™ll see
939987 [22378] to all this.â€
939987 [22379] 
939987 [22380] All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search was
939987 [22381] drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were
939987 [22382] carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left
939987 [22383] alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off
939987 [22384] him. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet
939987 [22385] stuck out, and he couldnâ€™t pull the quilt over so as to cover them.
939987 [22386] Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, â€œan insufferable
939987 [22387] time.â€ â€œHe thinks of me as a puppy,â€ thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth.
939987 [22388] â€œThat rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts
939987 [22389] him to see me naked!â€
939987 [22390] 
939987 [22391] Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned
939987 [22392] to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back
939987 [22393] with quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a peasant.
939987 [22394] 
939987 [22395] â€œHere are clothes for you,â€ he observed airily, seeming well satisfied
939987 [22396] with the success of his mission. â€œMr. Kalganov has kindly provided these
939987 [22397] for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he had them
939987 [22398] all in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.â€
939987 [22399] 
939987 [22400] Mitya flew into a passion.
939987 [22401] 
939987 [22402] â€œI wonâ€™t have other peopleâ€™s clothes!â€ he shouted menacingly, â€œgive me my
939987 [22403] own!â€
939987 [22404] 
939987 [22405] â€œItâ€™s impossible!â€
939987 [22406] 
939987 [22407] â€œGive me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!â€
939987 [22408] 
939987 [22409] It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded
939987 [22410] somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes,
939987 [22411] being stained with blood, must be â€œincluded with the other material
939987 [22412] evidence,â€ and that they â€œhad not even the right to let him have them now
939987 [22413] ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.â€ Mitya at
939987 [22414] last understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly
939987 [22415] dressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes
939987 [22416] were much better than his old ones, and that he disliked â€œgaining by the
939987 [22417] change.â€ The coat was, besides, â€œridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up
939987 [22418] like a fool ... for your amusement?â€
939987 [22419] 
939987 [22420] They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only
939987 [22421] a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. But
939987 [22422] the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.
939987 [22423] 
939987 [22424] â€œDamn it all! I can hardly button it,â€ Mitya grumbled. â€œBe so good as to
939987 [22425] tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didnâ€™t ask for his clothes, and itâ€™s not
939987 [22426] my doing that theyâ€™ve dressed me up like a clown.â€
939987 [22427] 
939987 [22428] â€œHe understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you his
939987 [22429] clothes, but sorry about all this business,â€ mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22430] 
939987 [22431] â€œConfound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?â€
939987 [22432] 
939987 [22433] He was asked to go back to the â€œother room.â€ Mitya went in, scowling with
939987 [22434] anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. Dressed in another manâ€™s
939987 [22435] clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, and
939987 [22436] of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in the
939987 [22437] doorway, and vanished immediately. â€œHeâ€™s come to look at me dressed up,â€
939987 [22438] thought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd
939987 [22439] nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.
939987 [22440] 
939987 [22441] â€œWell, what now? Are you going to flog me? Thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s left for
939987 [22442] you,â€ he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He would
939987 [22443] not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak to him.
939987 [22444] 
939987 [22445] â€œHe looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purpose
939987 [22446] to show every one how dirty they wereâ€”the scoundrel!â€
939987 [22447] 
939987 [22448] â€œWell, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,â€ observed
939987 [22449] Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mityaâ€™s question.
939987 [22450] 
939987 [22451] â€œYes,â€ said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on
939987 [22452] something.
939987 [22453] 
939987 [22454] â€œWeâ€™ve done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ Nikolay
939987 [22455] Parfenovitch went on, â€œbut having received from you such an uncompromising
939987 [22456] refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money
939987 [22457] found upon you, we are, at the present momentâ€”â€
939987 [22458] 
939987 [22459] â€œWhat is the stone in your ring?â€ Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though
939987 [22460] awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large rings
939987 [22461] adorning Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s right hand.
939987 [22462] 
939987 [22463] â€œRing?â€ repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.
939987 [22464] 
939987 [22465] â€œYes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it,
939987 [22466] what stone is that?â€ Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.
939987 [22467] 
939987 [22468] â€œThatâ€™s a smoky topaz,â€ said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. â€œWould you
939987 [22469] like to look at it? Iâ€™ll take it off ...â€
939987 [22470] 
939987 [22471] â€œNo, donâ€™t take it off,â€ cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and
939987 [22472] angry with himself. â€œDonâ€™t take it off ... thereâ€™s no need.... Damn it!...
939987 [22473] Gentlemen, youâ€™ve sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would conceal
939987 [22474] it from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie,
939987 [22475] and hide myself? No, thatâ€™s not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldnâ€™t
939987 [22476] do, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldnâ€™t have waited for your coming,
939987 [22477] or for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself
939987 [22478] before this, without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I
939987 [22479] couldnâ€™t have learnt so much in twenty years as Iâ€™ve found out in this
939987 [22480] accursed night!... And should I have been like this on this night, and at
939987 [22481] this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I have
939987 [22482] moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, if
939987 [22483] I had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought of
939987 [22484] having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all nightâ€”not from
939987 [22485] fearâ€”oh, not simply from fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And
939987 [22486] you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and
939987 [22487] believe in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another
939987 [22488] nasty thing Iâ€™ve done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from
939987 [22489] your accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my
939987 [22490] father and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he?
939987 [22491] Iâ€™m racking my brains and canâ€™t think who. But I can tell you it was not
939987 [22492] Dmitri Karamazov, and thatâ€™s all I can tell you, and thatâ€™s enough,
939987 [22493] enough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but donâ€™t bother me any
939987 [22494] more. Iâ€™ll say no more. Call your witnesses!â€
939987 [22495] 
939987 [22496] Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be
939987 [22497] absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the whole
939987 [22498] time and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were the
939987 [22499] most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:
939987 [22500] 
939987 [22501] â€œOh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well
939987 [22502] inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of
939987 [22503] the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us by
939987 [22504] Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly and
939987 [22505] emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming out
939987 [22506] to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his mind to go
939987 [22507] into it through the little gate which stood open, before he noticed you
939987 [22508] running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open window
939987 [22509] where you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while
939987 [22510] noticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him,
939987 [22511] the door, standing wide openâ€”that door which you have stated to have been
939987 [22512] shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from you
939987 [22513] that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must
939987 [22514] have run from that door, though, of course, he did not see you do so with
939987 [22515] his own eyes, since he only noticed you first some distance away in the
939987 [22516] garden, running towards the fence.â€
939987 [22517] 
939987 [22518] Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.
939987 [22519] 
939987 [22520] â€œNonsense!â€ he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, â€œitâ€™s a barefaced lie. He
939987 [22521] couldnâ€™t have seen the door open because it was shut. Heâ€™s lying!â€
939987 [22522] 
939987 [22523] â€œI consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He does
939987 [22524] not waver. He adheres to it. Weâ€™ve cross-examined him several times.â€
939987 [22525] 
939987 [22526] â€œPrecisely. I have cross-examined him several times,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch
939987 [22527] confirmed warmly.
939987 [22528] 
939987 [22529] â€œItâ€™s false, false! Itâ€™s either an attempt to slander me, or the
939987 [22530] hallucination of a madman,â€ Mitya still shouted. â€œHeâ€™s simply raving, from
939987 [22531] loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he came to....
939987 [22532] Heâ€™s raving.â€
939987 [22533] 
939987 [22534] â€œYes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after his
939987 [22535] injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from the
939987 [22536] lodge.â€
939987 [22537] 
939987 [22538] â€œBut itâ€™s false, itâ€™s false! It canâ€™t be so! Heâ€™s slandering me from
939987 [22539] spite.... He couldnâ€™t have seen it ... I didnâ€™t come from the door,â€
939987 [22540] gasped Mitya.
939987 [22541] 
939987 [22542] The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him
939987 [22543] impressively:
939987 [22544] 
939987 [22545] â€œConfront him with it.â€
939987 [22546] 
939987 [22547] â€œDo you recognize this object?â€
939987 [22548] 
939987 [22549] Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official
939987 [22550] envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope was
939987 [22551] empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.
939987 [22552] 
939987 [22553] â€œIt ... it must be that envelope of my fatherâ€™s, the envelope that
939987 [22554] contained the three thousand roubles ... and if thereâ€™s inscribed on it,
939987 [22555] allow me, â€˜For my little chickenâ€™ ... yesâ€”three thousand!â€ he shouted, â€œdo
939987 [22556] you see, three thousand, do you see?â€
939987 [22557] 
939987 [22558] â€œOf course, we see. But we didnâ€™t find the money in it. It was empty, and
939987 [22559] lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.â€
939987 [22560] 
939987 [22561] For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.
939987 [22562] 
939987 [22563] â€œGentlemen, itâ€™s Smerdyakov!â€ he shouted suddenly, at the top of his
939987 [22564] voice. â€œItâ€™s he whoâ€™s murdered him! Heâ€™s robbed him! No one else knew
939987 [22565] where the old man hid the envelope. Itâ€™s Smerdyakov, thatâ€™s clear, now!â€
939987 [22566] 
939987 [22567] â€œBut you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.â€
939987 [22568] 
939987 [22569] â€œI never knew it. Iâ€™ve never seen it. This is the first time Iâ€™ve looked
939987 [22570] at it. Iâ€™d only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only one who
939987 [22571] knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didnâ€™t know ...â€ Mitya was
939987 [22572] completely breathless.
939987 [22573] 
939987 [22574] â€œBut you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased
939987 [22575] fatherâ€™s pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so
939987 [22576] you must have known it.â€
939987 [22577] 
939987 [22578] â€œWeâ€™ve got it written down,â€ confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22579] 
939987 [22580] â€œNonsense! Itâ€™s absurd! Iâ€™d no idea it was under the pillow. And perhaps
939987 [22581] it wasnâ€™t under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance guess that it
939987 [22582] was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you asked him where
939987 [22583] it was? What does Smerdyakov say? thatâ€™s the chief point.... And I went
939987 [22584] out of my way to tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking
939987 [22585] that it was under the pillow, and now youâ€” Oh, you know how one says the
939987 [22586] wrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, only
939987 [22587] Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didnâ€™t even tell me where it was! But
939987 [22588] itâ€™s his doing, his doing; thereâ€™s no doubt about it, he murdered him,
939987 [22589] thatâ€™s as clear as daylight now,â€ Mitya exclaimed more and more
939987 [22590] frantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more
939987 [22591] exasperated and excited. â€œYou must understand that, and arrest him at
939987 [22592] once.... He must have killed him while I was running away and while
939987 [22593] Grigory was unconscious, thatâ€™s clear now.... He gave the signal and
939987 [22594] father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without
939987 [22595] the signal father would never have opened the door....â€
939987 [22596] 
939987 [22597] â€œBut youâ€™re again forgetting the circumstance,â€ the prosecutor observed,
939987 [22598] still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph,
939987 [22599] â€œthat there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open
939987 [22600] when you were there, while you were in the garden....â€
939987 [22601] 
939987 [22602] â€œThe door, the door,â€ muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the
939987 [22603] prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.
939987 [22604] 
939987 [22605] â€œYes, the door!... Itâ€™s a nightmare! God is against me!â€ he exclaimed,
939987 [22606] staring before him in complete stupefaction.
939987 [22607] 
939987 [22608] â€œCome, you see,â€ the prosecutor went on with dignity, â€œand you can judge
939987 [22609] for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence of
939987 [22610] the open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us.
939987 [22611] On the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak,
939987 [22612] obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the
939987 [22613] money which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours
939987 [22614] earlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten
939987 [22615] roubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we to
939987 [22616] believe, and what can we depend upon? And donâ€™t accuse us of being
939987 [22617] â€˜frigid, cynical, scoffing people,â€™ who are incapable of believing in the
939987 [22618] generous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter into our position ...â€
939987 [22619] 
939987 [22620] Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.
939987 [22621] 
939987 [22622] â€œVery well!â€ he exclaimed suddenly. â€œI will tell you my secret. Iâ€™ll tell
939987 [22623] you where I got the money!... Iâ€™ll reveal my shame, that I may not have to
939987 [22624] blame myself or you hereafter.â€
939987 [22625] 
939987 [22626] â€œAnd believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in a
939987 [22627] voice of almost pathetic delight, â€œthat every sincere and complete
939987 [22628] confession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immense
939987 [22629] influence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreoverâ€”â€
939987 [22630] 
939987 [22631] But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he checked
939987 [22632] himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.
939987 [22633] 
939987 [22634] 
939987 [22635] 
939987 [22636] Chapter VII. Mityaâ€™s Great Secret. Received With Hisses
939987 [22637] 
939987 [22638] 
939987 [22639] â€œGentlemen,â€ he began, still in the same agitation, â€œI want to make a full
939987 [22640] confession: that money was _my own_.â€ The lawyersâ€™ faces lengthened. That
939987 [22641] was not at all what they expected.
939987 [22642] 
939987 [22643] â€œHow do you mean?â€ faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, â€œwhen at five oâ€™clock on
939987 [22644] the same day, from your own confessionâ€”â€
939987 [22645] 
939987 [22646] â€œDamn five oâ€™clock on the same day and my own confession! Thatâ€™s nothing
939987 [22647] to do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is, stolen by me
939987 [22648] ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen hundred
939987 [22649] roubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...â€
939987 [22650] 
939987 [22651] â€œBut where did you get it?â€
939987 [22652] 
939987 [22653] â€œI took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here,
939987 [22654] round my neck, sewn up in a rag, and Iâ€™d had it round my neck a long time,
939987 [22655] itâ€™s a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace!â€
939987 [22656] 
939987 [22657] â€œAnd from whom did you ... appropriate it?â€
939987 [22658] 
939987 [22659] â€œYou mean, â€˜steal itâ€™? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I
939987 [22660] practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I â€˜appropriated it.â€™ I consider
939987 [22661] I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.â€
939987 [22662] 
939987 [22663] â€œLast night? But you said that itâ€™s a month since you ... obtained it?...â€
939987 [22664] 
939987 [22665] â€œYes. But not from my father. Not from my father, donâ€™t be uneasy. I
939987 [22666] didnâ€™t steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you without
939987 [22667] interrupting. Itâ€™s hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sent
939987 [22668] for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?â€
939987 [22669] 
939987 [22670] â€œYes, of course.â€
939987 [22671] 
939987 [22672] â€œI know you know her. Sheâ€™s a noble creature, noblest of the noble. But
939987 [22673] she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with good
939987 [22674] reason, good reason!â€
939987 [22675] 
939987 [22676] â€œKaterina Ivanovna!â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The
939987 [22677] prosecutor, too, stared.
939987 [22678] 
939987 [22679] â€œOh, donâ€™t take her name in vain! Iâ€™m a scoundrel to bring her into it.
939987 [22680] Yes, Iâ€™ve seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very first,
939987 [22681] even that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. Youâ€™re unworthy
939987 [22682] even to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only tell you that
939987 [22683] she sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to
939987 [22684] her sister and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldnâ€™t have
939987 [22685] sent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my
939987 [22686] life when I ... well, in fact, when Iâ€™d just come to love another, her,
939987 [22687] sheâ€™s sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroe
939987 [22688] then, and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand, but the
939987 [22689] other half I kept on me. Well, Iâ€™ve kept that other half, that fifteen
939987 [22690] hundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent
939987 [22691] it. Whatâ€™s left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now,
939987 [22692] Nikolay Parfenovitch. Thatâ€™s the change out of the fifteen hundred I had
939987 [22693] yesterday.â€
939987 [22694] 
939987 [22695] â€œExcuse me. Howâ€™s that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent
939987 [22696] three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.â€
939987 [22697] 
939987 [22698] â€œWho knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?â€
939987 [22699] 
939987 [22700] â€œWhy, you told every one yourself that youâ€™d spent exactly three
939987 [22701] thousand.â€
939987 [22702] 
939987 [22703] â€œItâ€™s true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so.
939987 [22704] And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. Yet I
939987 [22705] didnâ€™t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteen
939987 [22706] hundred I sewed into a little bag. Thatâ€™s how it was, gentlemen. Thatâ€™s
939987 [22707] where I got that money yesterday....â€
939987 [22708] 
939987 [22709] â€œThis is almost miraculous,â€ murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
939987 [22710] 
939987 [22711] â€œAllow me to inquire,â€ observed the prosecutor at last, â€œhave you informed
939987 [22712] any one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteen
939987 [22713] hundred left about you a month ago?â€
939987 [22714] 
939987 [22715] â€œI told no one.â€
939987 [22716] 
939987 [22717] â€œThatâ€™s strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?â€
939987 [22718] 
939987 [22719] â€œAbsolutely no one. No one and nobody.â€
939987 [22720] 
939987 [22721] â€œWhat was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for making
939987 [22722] such a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at last your
939987 [22723] secret, in your words, so â€˜disgraceful,â€™ though in realityâ€”that is, of
939987 [22724] course, comparatively speakingâ€”this action, that is, the appropriation of
939987 [22725] three thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only
939987 [22726] for a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest
939987 [22727] recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration
939987 [22728] your character.... Even admitting that it was an action in the highest
939987 [22729] degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not â€˜disgraceful.â€™... Many
939987 [22730] people have already guessed, during this last month, about the three
939987 [22731] thousand of Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s, that you have spent, and I heard the
939987 [22732] legend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for
939987 [22733] instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but
939987 [22734] the gossip of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not
939987 [22735] mistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the
939987 [22736] money was Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s, and so, itâ€™s extremely surprising to me
939987 [22737] that hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an
939987 [22738] extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently
939987 [22739] connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... Itâ€™s not easy
939987 [22740] to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a
939987 [22741] secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than
939987 [22742] confessing it ...â€
939987 [22743] 
939987 [22744] The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal his
939987 [22745] vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated
939987 [22746] spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.
939987 [22747] 
939987 [22748] â€œItâ€™s not the fifteen hundred thatâ€™s the disgrace, but that I put it apart
939987 [22749] from the rest of the three thousand,â€ said Mitya firmly.
939987 [22750] 
939987 [22751] â€œWhy?â€ smiled the prosecutor irritably. â€œWhat is there disgraceful, to
939987 [22752] your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had
939987 [22753] discreditably, if you prefer, â€˜disgracefully,â€™ appropriated? Your taking
939987 [22754] the three thousand is more important than what you did with it. And by the
939987 [22755] way, why did you do thatâ€”why did you set apart that half, for what
939987 [22756] purpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?â€
939987 [22757] 
939987 [22758] â€œOh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!â€ cried Mitya. â€œI put it
939987 [22759] aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be
939987 [22760] calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on
939987 [22761] a whole month.â€
939987 [22762] 
939987 [22763] â€œItâ€™s incomprehensible.â€
939987 [22764] 
939987 [22765] â€œI wonder at you. But Iâ€™ll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is
939987 [22766] incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate three
939987 [22767] thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all,
939987 [22768] and next morning I go to her and say, â€˜Katya, Iâ€™ve done wrong, Iâ€™ve
939987 [22769] squandered your three thousand,â€™ well, is that right? No, itâ€™s not
939987 [22770] rightâ€”itâ€™s dishonest and cowardly, Iâ€™m a beast, with no more self-control
939987 [22771] than a beast, thatâ€™s so, isnâ€™t it? But still Iâ€™m not a thief? Not a
939987 [22772] downright thief, youâ€™ll admit! I squandered it, but I didnâ€™t steal it. Now
939987 [22773] a second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may
939987 [22774] get confused againâ€”my headâ€™s going roundâ€”and so, for the second
939987 [22775] alternative: I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand,
939987 [22776] that is, only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: â€˜Katya, take
939987 [22777] this fifteen hundred from me, Iâ€™m a low beast, and an untrustworthy
939987 [22778] scoundrel, for Iâ€™ve wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so
939987 [22779] keep me from temptation!â€™ Well, what of that alternative? I should be a
939987 [22780] beast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not
939987 [22781] altogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but
939987 [22782] have kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back half,
939987 [22783] I should pay back what Iâ€™d spent, that I should never give up trying to,
939987 [22784] that I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should be
939987 [22785] a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!â€
939987 [22786] 
939987 [22787] â€œI admit that there is a certain distinction,â€ said the prosecutor, with a
939987 [22788] cold smile. â€œBut itâ€™s strange that you see such a vital difference.â€
939987 [22789] 
939987 [22790] â€œYes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps
939987 [22791] every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an
939987 [22792] arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I donâ€™t know how to make these
939987 [22793] fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, thatâ€™s my
939987 [22794] conviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make
939987 [22795] up my mind to give it back to-morrow, and Iâ€™m a scoundrel no longer, but I
939987 [22796] cannot make up my mind, you see, though Iâ€™m making up my mind every day,
939987 [22797] and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I
939987 [22798] canâ€™t bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is that
939987 [22799] right?â€
939987 [22800] 
939987 [22801] â€œCertainly, thatâ€™s not right, that I can quite understand, and that I
939987 [22802] donâ€™t dispute,â€ answered the prosecutor with reserve. â€œAnd let us give up
939987 [22803] all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will be
939987 [22804] so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have still not
939987 [22805] told us, altogether weâ€™ve asked you, why, in the first place, you halved
939987 [22806] the money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For what purpose
939987 [22807] exactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that fifteen
939987 [22808] hundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [22809] 
939987 [22810] â€œYes, of course!â€ cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; â€œforgive
939987 [22811] me, Iâ€™m worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or youâ€™d
939987 [22812] understand in a minute, for itâ€™s just the motive of it thatâ€™s the
939987 [22813] disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. He
939987 [22814] was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous; I thought
939987 [22815] then that she was hesitating between me and him. So I kept thinking every
939987 [22816] day, suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she
939987 [22817] were to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, â€˜I love
939987 [22818] you, not him; take me to the other end of the world.â€™ And Iâ€™d only forty
939987 [22819] copecks; how could I take her away, what could I do? Why, Iâ€™d be lost. You
939987 [22820] see, I didnâ€™t know her then, I didnâ€™t understand her, I thought she wanted
939987 [22821] money, and that she wouldnâ€™t forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly
939987 [22822] counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on
939987 [22823] it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off
939987 [22824] to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?â€
939987 [22825] 
939987 [22826] Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
939987 [22827] 
939987 [22828] â€œI should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have
939987 [22829] squandered it all,â€ chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, â€œfor after all what
939987 [22830] does it amount to?â€
939987 [22831] 
939987 [22832] â€œWhy, that I stole it, thatâ€™s what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify me
939987 [22833] by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up
939987 [22834] round my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, â€˜Youâ€™re a thief!
939987 [22835] youâ€™re a thief!â€™ Yes, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been so savage all this month,
939987 [22836] thatâ€™s why I fought in the tavern, thatâ€™s why I attacked my father, it was
939987 [22837] because I felt I was a thief. I couldnâ€™t make up my mind, I didnâ€™t dare
939987 [22838] even to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was
939987 [22839] such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried
939987 [22840] it I said to myself at the same time every hour: â€˜No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
939987 [22841] you may yet not be a thief.â€™ Why? Because I might go next day and pay back
939987 [22842] that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made up my mind to
939987 [22843] tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenyaâ€™s to Perhotin. I hadnâ€™t
939987 [22844] been able till that moment to bring myself to it. And it was only when I
939987 [22845] tore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man
939987 [22846] for the rest of my life. Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my
939987 [22847] dream of going to Katya and saying, â€˜Iâ€™m a scoundrel, but not a thief!â€™ Do
939987 [22848] you understand now? Do you understand?â€
939987 [22849] 
939987 [22850] â€œWhat was it made you decide to do it yesterday?â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch
939987 [22851] interrupted.
939987 [22852] 
939987 [22853] â€œWhy? Itâ€™s absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five
939987 [22854] oâ€™clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no difference
939987 [22855] whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see itâ€™s not so, it turns
939987 [22856] out that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what has
939987 [22857] tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that Iâ€™d
939987 [22858] killed the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my
939987 [22859] love was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh, that did
939987 [22860] torture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned
939987 [22861] consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and
939987 [22862] spent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you
939987 [22863] again, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I
939987 [22864] have learnt that itâ€™s not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but
939987 [22865] impossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....â€
939987 [22866] 
939987 [22867] Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his
939987 [22868] being intensely excited.
939987 [22869] 
939987 [22870] â€œI am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ the prosecutor
939987 [22871] said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. â€œBut all this, if
939987 [22872] youâ€™ll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... your
939987 [22873] overwrought nerves, thatâ€™s what it is. And why, for instance, should you
939987 [22874] not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going and
939987 [22875] returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you?
939987 [22876] And why could you not have explained things to her, and in view of your
939987 [22877] position, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had
939987 [22878] recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to oneâ€™s mind,
939987 [22879] that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her, why could you not
939987 [22880] have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, with
939987 [22881] her generous heart, she would certainly not have refused you in your
939987 [22882] distress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on the
939987 [22883] security you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I
939987 [22884] suppose you still regard that security as of value?â€
939987 [22885] 
939987 [22886] Mitya suddenly crimsoned.
939987 [22887] 
939987 [22888] â€œSurely you donâ€™t think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You
939987 [22889] canâ€™t be speaking in earnest?â€ he said, with indignation, looking the
939987 [22890] prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears.
939987 [22891] 
939987 [22892] â€œI assure you Iâ€™m in earnest.... Why do you imagine Iâ€™m not serious?â€ It
939987 [22893] was the prosecutorâ€™s turn to be surprised.
939987 [22894] 
939987 [22895] â€œOh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are
939987 [22896] torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. Iâ€™ll confess all my
939987 [22897] infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and youâ€™ll be surprised
939987 [22898] yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions
939987 [22899] can sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan you
939987 [22900] spoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that
939987 [22901] thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of
939987 [22902] deciding to go to Katyaâ€”I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to
939987 [22903] tell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out,
939987 [22904] for the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to
939987 [22905] beg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the
939987 [22906] other, the rival, who hated and insulted herâ€”to think of it! You must be
939987 [22907] mad, prosecutor!â€
939987 [22908] 
939987 [22909] â€œMad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that
939987 [22910] feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you
939987 [22911] assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,â€ said the
939987 [22912] prosecutor, smiling.
939987 [22913] 
939987 [22914] â€œBut that would have been so infamous!â€ Mitya brought his fist down on the
939987 [22915] table fiercely. â€œThat would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, do
939987 [22916] you know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she would have
939987 [22917] given it, too; sheâ€™d have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me,
939987 [22918] sheâ€™d have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me,
939987 [22919] for hers is an infernal nature, too, and sheâ€™s a woman of great wrath. Iâ€™d
939987 [22920] have taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have taken
939987 [22921] it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen,
939987 [22922] Iâ€™m making such an outcry because Iâ€™ve had that thought in my mind so
939987 [22923] lately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having all
939987 [22924] that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I
939987 [22925] remember, till that happened ...â€
939987 [22926] 
939987 [22927] â€œTill what happened?â€ put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mitya
939987 [22928] did not hear it.
939987 [22929] 
939987 [22930] â€œI have made you an awful confession,â€ Mitya said gloomily in conclusion.
939987 [22931] â€œYou must appreciate it, and whatâ€™s more, you must respect it, for if not,
939987 [22932] if that leaves your souls untouched, then youâ€™ve simply no respect for me,
939987 [22933] gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessed
939987 [22934] it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already
939987 [22935] that you donâ€™t believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?â€ he
939987 [22936] cried in dismay.
939987 [22937] 
939987 [22938] â€œYes, what you said just now,â€ said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at him
939987 [22939] in surprise, â€œthat is, that up to the last hour you were still
939987 [22940] contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... I
939987 [22941] assure you, thatâ€™s a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri
939987 [22942] Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you,
939987 [22943] particularly important for you.â€
939987 [22944] 
939987 [22945] â€œHave mercy, gentlemen!â€ Mitya flung up his hands. â€œDonâ€™t write that,
939987 [22946] anyway; have some shame. Here Iâ€™ve torn my heart asunder before you, and
939987 [22947] you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves....
939987 [22948] Oh, my God!â€
939987 [22949] 
939987 [22950] In despair he hid his face in his hands.
939987 [22951] 
939987 [22952] â€œDonâ€™t worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ observed the prosecutor,
939987 [22953] â€œeverything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and
939987 [22954] what you donâ€™t agree to weâ€™ll alter as you like. But now Iâ€™ll ask you one
939987 [22955] little question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heard
939987 [22956] from you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost
939987 [22957] impossible to believe.â€
939987 [22958] 
939987 [22959] â€œNo one, no one, I told you so before, or youâ€™ve not understood anything!
939987 [22960] Let me alone!â€
939987 [22961] 
939987 [22962] â€œVery well, this matter is bound to be explained, and thereâ€™s plenty of
939987 [22963] time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses
939987 [22964] that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere
939987 [22965] about the three thousand youâ€™d spent here; three thousand, not fifteen
939987 [22966] hundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday,
939987 [22967] you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand
939987 [22968] with you.â€
939987 [22969] 
939987 [22970] â€œYouâ€™ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses,
939987 [22971] two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!â€ cried Mitya.
939987 [22972] 
939987 [22973] â€œWell, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ means
939987 [22974] something.â€
939987 [22975] 
939987 [22976] â€œIt means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.â€
939987 [22977] 
939987 [22978] â€œBut what need had you to â€˜talk rot,â€™ as you call it?â€
939987 [22979] 
939987 [22980] â€œThe devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much
939987 [22981] money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes,
939987 [22982] that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?
939987 [22983] Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once Iâ€™d said it, I didnâ€™t
939987 [22984] care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?â€
939987 [22985] 
939987 [22986] â€œThatâ€™s very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man
939987 [22987] tell lies,â€ observed the prosecutor impressively. â€œTell me, though, was
939987 [22988] that â€˜amulet,â€™ as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?â€
939987 [22989] 
939987 [22990] â€œNo, not big.â€
939987 [22991] 
939987 [22992] â€œHow big, for instance?â€
939987 [22993] 
939987 [22994] â€œIf you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the size.â€
939987 [22995] 
939987 [22996] â€œYouâ€™d better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.â€
939987 [22997] 
939987 [22998] â€œDamnation, what nonsense! I donâ€™t know where they are.â€
939987 [22999] 
939987 [23000] â€œBut excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According to
939987 [23001] your own evidence you didnâ€™t go home.â€
939987 [23002] 
939987 [23003] â€œWhen I was going from Fenyaâ€™s to Perhotinâ€™s, on the way I tore it off my
939987 [23004] neck and took out the money.â€
939987 [23005] 
939987 [23006] â€œIn the dark?â€
939987 [23007] 
939987 [23008] â€œWhat should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one minute.â€
939987 [23009] 
939987 [23010] â€œWithout scissors, in the street?â€
939987 [23011] 
939987 [23012] â€œIn the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag. It
939987 [23013] was torn in a minute.â€
939987 [23014] 
939987 [23015] â€œWhere did you put it afterwards?â€
939987 [23016] 
939987 [23017] â€œI dropped it there.â€
939987 [23018] 
939987 [23019] â€œWhere was it, exactly?â€
939987 [23020] 
939987 [23021] â€œIn the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows whereabouts.
939987 [23022] What do you want to know for?â€
939987 [23023] 
939987 [23024] â€œThatâ€™s extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be material
939987 [23025] evidence in your favor. How is it you donâ€™t understand that? Who helped
939987 [23026] you to sew it up a month ago?â€
939987 [23027] 
939987 [23028] â€œNo one helped me. I did it myself.â€
939987 [23029] 
939987 [23030] â€œCan you sew?â€
939987 [23031] 
939987 [23032] â€œA soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.â€
939987 [23033] 
939987 [23034] â€œWhere did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed the
939987 [23035] money?â€
939987 [23036] 
939987 [23037] â€œAre you laughing at me?â€
939987 [23038] 
939987 [23039] â€œNot at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [23040] 
939987 [23041] â€œI donâ€™t know where I got the rag fromâ€”somewhere, I suppose.â€
939987 [23042] 
939987 [23043] â€œI should have thought you couldnâ€™t have forgotten it?â€
939987 [23044] 
939987 [23045] â€œUpon my word, I donâ€™t remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.â€
939987 [23046] 
939987 [23047] â€œThatâ€™s very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the
939987 [23048] shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag was
939987 [23049] it, cloth or linen?â€
939987 [23050] 
939987 [23051] â€œGoodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didnâ€™t tear
939987 [23052] it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it up in a
939987 [23053] cap of my landladyâ€™s.â€
939987 [23054] 
939987 [23055] â€œIn your landladyâ€™s cap?â€
939987 [23056] 
939987 [23057] â€œYes. I took it from her.â€
939987 [23058] 
939987 [23059] â€œHow did you get it?â€
939987 [23060] 
939987 [23061] â€œYou see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my pen
939987 [23062] on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore it
939987 [23063] up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it was in that
939987 [23064] very rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.â€
939987 [23065] 
939987 [23066] â€œAnd you remember that for certain now?â€
939987 [23067] 
939987 [23068] â€œI donâ€™t know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang
939987 [23069] it, what does it matter?â€
939987 [23070] 
939987 [23071] â€œIn that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?â€
939987 [23072] 
939987 [23073] â€œNo, she wonâ€™t, she didnâ€™t miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an old
939987 [23074] rag not worth a farthing.â€
939987 [23075] 
939987 [23076] â€œAnd where did you get the needle and thread?â€
939987 [23077] 
939987 [23078] â€œIâ€™ll stop now. I wonâ€™t say any more. Enough of it!â€ said Mitya, losing
939987 [23079] his temper at last.
939987 [23080] 
939987 [23081] â€œItâ€™s strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw
939987 [23082] the pieces in the market-place.â€
939987 [23083] 
939987 [23084] â€œGive orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhaps
939987 [23085] youâ€™ll find it,â€ said Mitya, sneering. â€œEnough, gentlemen, enough!â€ he
939987 [23086] decided, in an exhausted voice. â€œI see you donâ€™t believe me! Not for a
939987 [23087] moment! Itâ€™s my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why,
939987 [23088] why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? Itâ€™s a joke to
939987 [23089] you. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a
939987 [23090] hymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you torturers!â€
939987 [23091] 
939987 [23092] He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were silent.
939987 [23093] A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly. His
939987 [23094] face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat mute and passive
939987 [23095] as though hardly conscious of what was happening. In the meantime they had
939987 [23096] to finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examining
939987 [23097] the witnesses. It was by now eight oâ€™clock in the morning. The lights had
939987 [23098] been extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been
939987 [23099] continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had
939987 [23100] been going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very
939987 [23101] tired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain
939987 [23102] streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
939987 [23103] 
939987 [23104] â€œMay I look out of the window?â€ he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly.
939987 [23105] 
939987 [23106] â€œOh, as much as you like,â€ the latter replied.
939987 [23107] 
939987 [23108] Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its little
939987 [23109] greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the house, and
939987 [23110] farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts,
939987 [23111] looking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought of â€œPhÅ“bus the
939987 [23112] golden-haired,â€ and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray.
939987 [23113] â€œPerhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,â€ he thought with
939987 [23114] a smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his
939987 [23115] â€œtorturers.â€
939987 [23116] 
939987 [23117] â€œGentlemen,â€ he cried, â€œI see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about her,
939987 [23118] I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? Sheâ€™s innocent, you
939987 [23119] know, she was out of her mind when she cried last night â€˜Itâ€™s all my
939987 [23120] fault!â€™ Sheâ€™s done nothing, nothing! Iâ€™ve been grieving over her all night
939987 [23121] as I sat with you.... Canâ€™t you, wonâ€™t you tell me what you are going to
939987 [23122] do with her now?â€
939987 [23123] 
939987 [23124] â€œYou can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€
939987 [23125] the prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity. â€œWe have, so far,
939987 [23126] no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested. I
939987 [23127] trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case.... On
939987 [23128] the contrary, weâ€™ll do everything that lies in our power in that matter.
939987 [23129] Set your mind completely at rest.â€
939987 [23130] 
939987 [23131] â€œGentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward
939987 [23132] people in spite of everything. Youâ€™ve taken a load off my heart.... Well,
939987 [23133] what are we to do now? Iâ€™m ready.â€
939987 [23134] 
939987 [23135] â€œWell, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnesses
939987 [23136] without delay. That must be done in your presence and thereforeâ€”â€
939987 [23137] 
939987 [23138] â€œShouldnâ€™t we have some tea first?â€ interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, â€œI
939987 [23139] think weâ€™ve deserved it!â€
939987 [23140] 
939987 [23141] They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had, no
939987 [23142] doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then â€œgo on and
939987 [23143] on,â€ putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable
939987 [23144] opportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya at
939987 [23145] first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him,
939987 [23146] but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked
939987 [23147] surprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculean
939987 [23148] strength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent
939987 [23149] emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he could
939987 [23150] hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects about him
939987 [23151] seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. â€œA little more and I shall
939987 [23152] begin raving,â€ he said to himself.
939987 [23153] 
939987 [23154] 
939987 [23155] 
939987 [23156] Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe
939987 [23157] 
939987 [23158] 
939987 [23159] The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our story
939987 [23160] in such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay
939987 [23161] Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his
939987 [23162] evidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he would
939987 [23163] afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every witness was
939987 [23164] called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and so on. We will only
939987 [23165] note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the
939987 [23166] question of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here,
939987 [23167] at Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand
939987 [23168] or fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen
939987 [23169] hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned out to
939987 [23170] be against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some witnesses
939987 [23171] introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his, Mityaâ€™s,
939987 [23172] story.
939987 [23173] 
939987 [23174] The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not in the
939987 [23175] least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the contrary, an
939987 [23176] air of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him an
939987 [23177] appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity. He spoke little, and with
939987 [23178] reserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and deliberately.
939987 [23179] Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month
939987 [23180] before could not have been less than three thousand, that all the peasants
939987 [23181] about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand
939987 [23182] mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. â€œWhat a lot of money he flung
939987 [23183] away on the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them
939987 [23184] alone.â€
939987 [23185] 
939987 [23186] â€œI donâ€™t believe I gave them five hundred,â€ was Mityaâ€™s gloomy comment on
939987 [23187] this. â€œItâ€™s a pity I didnâ€™t count the money at the time, but I was
939987 [23188] drunk....â€
939987 [23189] 
939987 [23190] Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He listened
939987 [23191] gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he would say:
939987 [23192] 
939987 [23193] â€œOh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.â€
939987 [23194] 
939987 [23195] â€œMore than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,â€ retorted Trifon
939987 [23196] Borissovitch firmly. â€œYou flung it about at random and they picked it up.
939987 [23197] They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers, theyâ€™ve been driven
939987 [23198] away from here, or maybe theyâ€™d bear witness themselves how much they got
939987 [23199] from you. I saw the sum in your hands, myselfâ€”count it I didnâ€™t, you
939987 [23200] didnâ€™t let me, thatâ€™s true enoughâ€”but by the look of it I should say it
939987 [23201] was far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! Weâ€™ve seen
939987 [23202] money too. We can judge of amounts....â€
939987 [23203] 
939987 [23204] As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had
939987 [23205] told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three thousand with
939987 [23206] him.
939987 [23207] 
939987 [23208] â€œCome now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?â€ replied Mitya. â€œSurely I
939987 [23209] didnâ€™t declare so positively that Iâ€™d brought three thousand?â€
939987 [23210] 
939987 [23211] â€œYou did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andrey
939987 [23212] himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when you were
939987 [23213] treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave your
939987 [23214] sixth thousand hereâ€”that is with what you spent before, we must
939987 [23215] understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too,
939987 [23216] was standing beside you at the time. Maybe heâ€™d remember it....â€
939987 [23217] 
939987 [23218] The evidence as to the â€œsixthâ€ thousand made an extraordinary impression
939987 [23219] on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning;
939987 [23220] three and three made six, three thousand then and three now made six, that
939987 [23221] was clear.
939987 [23222] 
939987 [23223] They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch, Stepan
939987 [23224] and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The peasants and the driver
939987 [23225] unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitchâ€™s evidence. They noted down,
939987 [23226] with particular care, Andreyâ€™s account of the conversation he had had with
939987 [23227] Mitya on the road: â€œ â€˜Where,â€™ says he, â€˜am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going,
939987 [23228] to heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?â€™ â€
939987 [23229] 
939987 [23230] The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile, and
939987 [23231] ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [23232] would go should be â€œincluded in the case.â€
939987 [23233] 
939987 [23234] Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored, and
939987 [23235] he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his
939987 [23236] life, though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day
939987 [23237] for a long time past. He began by saying that â€œhe knew nothing about it
939987 [23238] and didnâ€™t want to.â€ But it appeared that he had heard of the â€œsixthâ€
939987 [23239] thousand, and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the
939987 [23240] moment. As far as he could see he â€œdidnâ€™t knowâ€ how much money Mitya had
939987 [23241] in his hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply to
939987 [23242] reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned out,
939987 [23243] Mityaâ€™s position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved, and
939987 [23244] that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna
939987 [23245] with reserve and respect, as though she had been a lady of the best
939987 [23246] society, and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka. In spite of
939987 [23247] the young manâ€™s obvious repugnance at giving evidence, Ippolit
939987 [23248] Kirillovitch examined him at great length, and only from him learnt all
939987 [23249] the details of what made up Mityaâ€™s â€œromance,â€ so to say, on that night.
939987 [23250] Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go,
939987 [23251] and he left the room with unconcealed indignation.
939987 [23252] 
939987 [23253] The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in their room,
939987 [23254] they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police officers
939987 [23255] they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would certainly be
939987 [23256] sent for. They gave their evidence with dignity, though not without some
939987 [23257] uneasiness. The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the
939987 [23258] twelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name
939987 [23259] was Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated
939987 [23260] dentist. Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering
939987 [23261] the room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was
939987 [23262] standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most important
939987 [23263] person and in command, and addressed him at every word as â€œPan Colonel.â€
939987 [23264] Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they grasped
939987 [23265] that they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It
939987 [23266] turned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their
939987 [23267] accent in some words. Of his relations with Grushenka, past and present,
939987 [23268] Pan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at
939987 [23269] once and declared that he would not allow the â€œscoundrelâ€ to speak like
939987 [23270] that in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the
939987 [23271] word â€œscoundrelâ€ and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.
939987 [23272] Mitya fumed with rage.
939987 [23273] 
939987 [23274] â€œHeâ€™s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, too,
939987 [23275] that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that heâ€™s a scoundrel!â€ he
939987 [23276] cried.
939987 [23277] 
939987 [23278] Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he showed the
939987 [23279] most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly reprimanding Mitya,
939987 [23280] he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case, and
939987 [23281] hastened to pass to what was essential. One piece of evidence given by the
939987 [23282] Poles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very
939987 [23283] room, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him
939987 [23284] three thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down,
939987 [23285] and the remaining two thousand three hundred â€œto be paid next day in the
939987 [23286] town.â€ He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at
939987 [23287] Mokroe, but that his money was in the town. Mitya observed hotly that he
939987 [23288] had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in
939987 [23289] the town. But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after
939987 [23290] thinking for a moment admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the
939987 [23291] Poles stated, that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have
939987 [23292] said so.
939987 [23293] 
939987 [23294] The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It seemed to
939987 [23295] establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base this deduction
939987 [23296] on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had come into
939987 [23297] Mityaâ€™s hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town, or
939987 [23298] even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe. This would explain the
939987 [23299] circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only eight hundred
939987 [23300] roubles were to be found in Mityaâ€™s hands. This circumstance had been the
939987 [23301] one piece of evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told,
939987 [23302] to some extent, in Mityaâ€™s favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his
939987 [23303] favor had broken down. In answer to the prosecutorâ€™s inquiry, where he
939987 [23304] would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he
939987 [23305] himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently
939987 [23306] replied that he had meant to offer the â€œlittle chap,â€ not money, but a
939987 [23307] formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya,
939987 [23308] those rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov.
939987 [23309] The prosecutor positively smiled at the â€œinnocence of this subterfuge.â€
939987 [23310] 
939987 [23311] â€œAnd you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for
939987 [23312] two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?â€
939987 [23313] 
939987 [23314] â€œHe certainly would have accepted it,â€ Mitya declared warmly. â€œWhy, look
939987 [23315] here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for it. He
939987 [23316] would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and might have
939987 [23317] got, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the old man.â€
939987 [23318] 
939987 [23319] The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the protocol
939987 [23320] in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The incident of the
939987 [23321] cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay Parfenovitch was too
939987 [23322] well pleased with them, as it was, and did not want to worry them with
939987 [23323] trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a foolish, drunken quarrel over
939987 [23324] cards. There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night.... So the
939987 [23325] two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles.
939987 [23326] 
939987 [23327] Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached with little
939987 [23328] steps, looking very disheveled and depressed. He had, all this time, taken
939987 [23329] refuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her, and â€œnow and then
939987 [23330] heâ€™d begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue check
939987 [23331] handkerchief,â€ as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she
939987 [23332] herself began trying to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once
939987 [23333] confessed that he had done wrong, that he had borrowed â€œten roubles in my
939987 [23334] poverty,â€ from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.
939987 [23335] To Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s direct question, had he noticed how much money
939987 [23336] Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have been able to see the
939987 [23337] sum better than any one when he took the note from him, Maximov, in the
939987 [23338] most positive manner, declared that there was twenty thousand.
939987 [23339] 
939987 [23340] â€œHave you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?â€ inquired
939987 [23341] Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.
939987 [23342] 
939987 [23343] â€œTo be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my
939987 [23344] little property. Sheâ€™d only let me look at it from a distance, boasting of
939987 [23345] it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored notes. And
939987 [23346] Dmitri Fyodorovitchâ€™s were all rainbow-colored....â€
939987 [23347] 
939987 [23348] He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenkaâ€™s turn. Nikolay
939987 [23349] Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might
939987 [23350] have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition to him, but Mitya
939987 [23351] bowed his head in silence, giving him to understand â€œthat he would not
939987 [23352] make a scene.â€ Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in. She entered
939987 [23353] with a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed and sat down
939987 [23354] quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very
939987 [23355] pale, she seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her
939987 [23356] magnificent black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish
939987 [23357] chillâ€”the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her
939987 [23358] grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorable
939987 [23359] impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit
939987 [23360] â€œfascinated.â€ He admitted himself, when talking about it afterwards, that
939987 [23361] only then had he seen â€œhow handsome the woman was,â€ for, though he had
939987 [23362] seen her several times before, he had always looked upon her as something
939987 [23363] of a â€œprovincial hetaira.â€ â€œShe has the manners of the best society,â€ he
939987 [23364] said enthusiastically, gossiping about her in a circle of ladies. But this
939987 [23365] was received with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediately
939987 [23366] called him a â€œnaughty man,â€ to his great satisfaction.
939987 [23367] 
939987 [23368] As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya,
939987 [23369] who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at once. After the
939987 [23370] first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her,
939987 [23371] hesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous manner, on what
939987 [23372] terms she was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
939987 [23373] To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied:
939987 [23374] 
939987 [23375] â€œHe was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance during the
939987 [23376] last month.â€ To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and
939987 [23377] with complete frankness, that, though â€œat timesâ€ she had thought him
939987 [23378] attractive, she had not loved him, but had won his heart as well as his
939987 [23379] old fatherâ€™s â€œin my nasty spite,â€ that she had seen that Mitya was very
939987 [23380] jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only amused
939987 [23381] her. She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been
939987 [23382] laughing at him. â€œI had no thoughts for either of them all this last
939987 [23383] month. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,â€ she
939987 [23384] said in conclusion, â€œthat thereâ€™s no need for you to inquire about that,
939987 [23385] nor for me to answer you, for thatâ€™s my own affair.â€
939987 [23386] 
939987 [23387] Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissed
939987 [23388] the â€œromanticâ€ aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is,
939987 [23389] to the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles.
939987 [23390] Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had
939987 [23391] certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had
939987 [23392] not counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand
939987 [23393] from Dmitri Fyodorovitchâ€™s own lips.
939987 [23394] 
939987 [23395] â€œDid he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear
939987 [23396] him speak of it to others in your presence?â€ the prosecutor inquired
939987 [23397] immediately.
939987 [23398] 
939987 [23399] To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other
939987 [23400] people, and had heard him say so when they were alone.
939987 [23401] 
939987 [23402] â€œDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?â€ inquired the
939987 [23403] prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.
939987 [23404] 
939987 [23405] Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.
939987 [23406] Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money
939987 [23407] had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina
939987 [23408] Ivanovna.
939987 [23409] 
939987 [23410] â€œAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not
939987 [23411] three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that
939987 [23412] sum for his own use?â€
939987 [23413] 
939987 [23414] â€œNo, I never heard that,â€ answered Grushenka.
939987 [23415] 
939987 [23416] It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her
939987 [23417] that he hadnâ€™t a farthing.
939987 [23418] 
939987 [23419] â€œHe was always expecting to get some from his father,â€ said Grushenka in
939987 [23420] conclusion.
939987 [23421] 
939987 [23422] â€œDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,â€
939987 [23423] Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, â€œthat he intended to make an attempt
939987 [23424] on his fatherâ€™s life?â€
939987 [23425] 
939987 [23426] â€œAch, he did say so,â€ sighed Grushenka.
939987 [23427] 
939987 [23428] â€œOnce or several times?â€
939987 [23429] 
939987 [23430] â€œHe mentioned it several times, always in anger.â€
939987 [23431] 
939987 [23432] â€œAnd did you believe he would do it?â€
939987 [23433] 
939987 [23434] â€œNo, I never believed it,â€ she answered firmly. â€œI had faith in his noble
939987 [23435] heart.â€
939987 [23436] 
939987 [23437] â€œGentlemen, allow me,â€ cried Mitya suddenly, â€œallow me to say one word to
939987 [23438] Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.â€
939987 [23439] 
939987 [23440] â€œYou can speak,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.
939987 [23441] 
939987 [23442] â€œAgrafena Alexandrovna!â€ Mitya got up from his chair, â€œhave faith in God
939987 [23443] and in me. I am not guilty of my fatherâ€™s murder!â€
939987 [23444] 
939987 [23445] Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair. Grushenka
939987 [23446] stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. â€œThanks be to Thee,
939987 [23447] O Lord,â€ she said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still standing,
939987 [23448] she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added:
939987 [23449] 
939987 [23450] â€œAs he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. Heâ€™ll say anything as a
939987 [23451] joke or from obstinacy, but heâ€™ll never deceive you against his
939987 [23452] conscience. Heâ€™s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.â€
939987 [23453] 
939987 [23454] â€œThanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, youâ€™ve given me fresh courage,â€ Mitya
939987 [23455] responded in a quivering voice.
939987 [23456] 
939987 [23457] As to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not know
939987 [23458] what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had three
939987 [23459] thousand with him. And to the question where he got the money, she said
939987 [23460] that he had told her that he had â€œstolenâ€ it from Katerina Ivanovna, and
939987 [23461] that she had replied to that that he hadnâ€™t stolen it, and that he must
939987 [23462] pay the money back next day. On the prosecutorâ€™s asking her emphatically
939987 [23463] whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he
939987 [23464] had spent yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she
939987 [23465] declared that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was how
939987 [23466] she understood him.
939987 [23467] 
939987 [23468] Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her
939987 [23469] impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could
939987 [23470] be of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she would care
939987 [23471] for an escort, he ... would beâ€”
939987 [23472] 
939987 [23473] â€œI thank you sincerely,â€ said Grushenka, bowing to him, â€œIâ€™m going with
939987 [23474] this old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and meanwhile,
939987 [23475] if youâ€™ll allow me, Iâ€™ll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri
939987 [23476] Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [23477] 
939987 [23478] She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only for
939987 [23479] a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness.
939987 [23480] His eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the witnesses was,
939987 [23481] at last, over. They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya
939987 [23482] got up, moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a
939987 [23483] large chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.
939987 [23484] 
939987 [23485] He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the
939987 [23486] time.
939987 [23487] 
939987 [23488] He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed long
939987 [23489] ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses,
939987 [23490] through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November, and the
939987 [23491] snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched the
939987 [23492] earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair, long beard. He
939987 [23493] was not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on a gray peasantâ€™s
939987 [23494] smock. Not far off was a village, he could see the black huts, and half
939987 [23495] the huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.
939987 [23496] And as they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a
939987 [23497] lot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of
939987 [23498] brownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman, who looked
939987 [23499] forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin face. And in her
939987 [23500] arms was a little baby crying. And her breasts seemed so dried up that
939987 [23501] there was not a drop of milk in them. And the child cried and cried, and
939987 [23502] held out its little bare arms, with its little fists blue from cold.
939987 [23503] 
939987 [23504] â€œWhy are they crying? Why are they crying?â€ Mitya asked, as they dashed
939987 [23505] gayly by.
939987 [23506] 
939987 [23507] â€œItâ€™s the babe,â€ answered the driver, â€œthe babe weeping.â€
939987 [23508] 
939987 [23509] And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, â€œthe babe,â€ and he
939987 [23510] liked the peasantâ€™s calling it a â€œbabe.â€ There seemed more pity in it.
939987 [23511] 
939987 [23512] â€œBut why is it weeping?â€ Mitya persisted stupidly, â€œwhy are its little
939987 [23513] arms bare? Why donâ€™t they wrap it up?â€
939987 [23514] 
939987 [23515] â€œThe babeâ€™s cold, its little clothes are frozen and donâ€™t warm it.â€
939987 [23516] 
939987 [23517] â€œBut why is it? Why?â€ foolish Mitya still persisted.
939987 [23518] 
939987 [23519] â€œWhy, theyâ€™re poor people, burnt out. Theyâ€™ve no bread. Theyâ€™re begging
939987 [23520] because theyâ€™ve been burnt out.â€
939987 [23521] 
939987 [23522] â€œNo, no,â€ Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. â€œTell me why it is
939987 [23523] those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe poor?
939987 [23524] Why is the steppe barren? Why donâ€™t they hug each other and kiss? Why
939987 [23525] donâ€™t they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black misery? Why
939987 [23526] donâ€™t they feed the babe?â€
939987 [23527] 
939987 [23528] And he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,
939987 [23529] yet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way. And
939987 [23530] he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, was
939987 [23531] rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do something
939987 [23532] for them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that the
939987 [23533] dark-faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tears
939987 [23534] again from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at once,
939987 [23535] regardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.
939987 [23536] 
939987 [23537] â€œAnd Iâ€™m coming with you. I wonâ€™t leave you now for the rest of my life,
939987 [23538] Iâ€™m coming with you,â€ he heard close beside him Grushenkaâ€™s tender voice,
939987 [23539] thrilling with emotion. And his heart glowed, and he struggled forward
939987 [23540] towards the light, and he longed to live, to live, to go on and on,
939987 [23541] towards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!
939987 [23542] 
939987 [23543] â€œWhat! Where?â€ he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the chest,
939987 [23544] as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay
939987 [23545] Parfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the
939987 [23546] protocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an
939987 [23547] hour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenly
939987 [23548] struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head, which hadnâ€™t
939987 [23549] been there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.
939987 [23550] 
939987 [23551] â€œWho put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?â€ he cried, with a
939987 [23552] sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some great
939987 [23553] kindness had been shown him.
939987 [23554] 
939987 [23555] He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant
939987 [23556] witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s little secretary, had compassionately
939987 [23557] thought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole soul was quivering
939987 [23558] with tears. He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they
939987 [23559] liked.
939987 [23560] 
939987 [23561] â€œIâ€™ve had a good dream, gentlemen,â€ he said in a strange voice, with a new
939987 [23562] light, as of joy, in his face.
939987 [23563] 
939987 [23564] 
939987 [23565] 
939987 [23566] Chapter IX. They Carry Mitya Away
939987 [23567] 
939987 [23568] 
939987 [23569] When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to
939987 [23570] the prisoner and read him the â€œCommittal,â€ setting forth, that in such a
939987 [23571] year, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer of
939987 [23572] such-and-such a district court, having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya)
939987 [23573] accused of this and of that (all the charges were carefully written out)
939987 [23574] and having considered that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges
939987 [23575] made against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while the
939987 [23576] witnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such
939987 [23577] testify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of
939987 [23578] the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order to preclude
939987 [23579] so-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he be
939987 [23580] detained in such-and-such a prison, which he hereby notifies to the
939987 [23581] accused and communicates a copy of this same â€œCommittalâ€ to the deputy
939987 [23582] prosecutor, and so on, and so on.
939987 [23583] 
939987 [23584] In brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a prisoner,
939987 [23585] and that he would be driven at once to the town, and there shut up in a
939987 [23586] very unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged his
939987 [23587] shoulders.
939987 [23588] 
939987 [23589] â€œWell, gentlemen, I donâ€™t blame you. Iâ€™m ready.... I understand that
939987 [23590] thereâ€™s nothing else for you to do.â€
939987 [23591] 
939987 [23592] Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at once
939987 [23593] by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be on
939987 [23594] the spot....
939987 [23595] 
939987 [23596] â€œStay,â€ Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable
939987 [23597] feeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:
939987 [23598] 
939987 [23599] â€œGentlemen, weâ€™re all cruel, weâ€™re all monsters, we all make men weep, and
939987 [23600] mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now,
939987 [23601] of all I am the lowest reptile! Iâ€™ve sworn to amend, and every day Iâ€™ve
939987 [23602] done the same filthy things. I understand now that such men as I need a
939987 [23603] blow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a
939987 [23604] force from without. Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the
939987 [23605] thunderbolt has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public
939987 [23606] shame, I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I
939987 [23607] shall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not
939987 [23608] guilty of my fatherâ€™s blood. I accept my punishment, not because I killed
939987 [23609] him, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really might have
939987 [23610] killed him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I warn you of that.
939987 [23611] Iâ€™ll fight it out with you to the end, and then God will decide. Good-by,
939987 [23612] gentlemen, donâ€™t be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the
939987 [23613] examination. Oh, I was still such a fool then.... In another minute I
939987 [23614] shall be a prisoner, but now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri
939987 [23615] Karamazov offers you his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to all
939987 [23616] men.â€
939987 [23617] 
939987 [23618] His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay
939987 [23619] Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden, almost
939987 [23620] nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya instantly noticed
939987 [23621] this, and started. He let his outstretched hand fall at once.
939987 [23622] 
939987 [23623] â€œThe preliminary inquiry is not yet over,â€ Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered,
939987 [23624] somewhat embarrassed. â€œWe will continue it in the town, and I, for my
939987 [23625] part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your defense....
939987 [23626] As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, Iâ€™ve always been disposed to
939987 [23627] regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty. All of us here,
939987 [23628] if I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready to recognize that
939987 [23629] you are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas, one who has been
939987 [23630] carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree....â€
939987 [23631] 
939987 [23632] Nikolay Parfenovitchâ€™s little figure was positively majestic by the time
939987 [23633] he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another minute this
939987 [23634] â€œboyâ€ would take his arm, lead him to another corner, and renew their
939987 [23635] conversation about â€œgirls.â€ But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate
939987 [23636] thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to
939987 [23637] execution.
939987 [23638] 
939987 [23639] â€œGentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _her_ to say â€˜good-byâ€™
939987 [23640] for the last time?â€ asked Mitya.
939987 [23641] 
939987 [23642] â€œCertainly, but considering ... in fact, now itâ€™s impossible except in the
939987 [23643] presence ofâ€”â€
939987 [23644] 
939987 [23645] â€œOh, well, if it must be so, it must!â€
939987 [23646] 
939987 [23647] Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words,
939987 [23648] and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka made a deep bow
939987 [23649] to Mitya.
939987 [23650] 
939987 [23651] â€œI have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow you for
939987 [23652] ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though
939987 [23653] youâ€™ve been your own undoing.â€
939987 [23654] 
939987 [23655] Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.
939987 [23656] 
939987 [23657] â€œForgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.â€
939987 [23658] 
939987 [23659] Mitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went out. He
939987 [23660] was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him. At the
939987 [23661] bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day
939987 [23662] before with Andreyâ€™s three horses, two carts stood in readiness. Mavriky
939987 [23663] Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed
939987 [23664] about something, some sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He
939987 [23665] asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.
939987 [23666] 
939987 [23667] â€œWhen I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a different
939987 [23668] face,â€ thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was a crowd of
939987 [23669] people, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down the
939987 [23670] steps too. All stared at Mitya.
939987 [23671] 
939987 [23672] â€œForgive me at parting, good people!â€ Mitya shouted suddenly from the
939987 [23673] cart.
939987 [23674] 
939987 [23675] â€œForgive us too!â€ he heard two or three voices.
939987 [23676] 
939987 [23677] â€œGood-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!â€
939987 [23678] 
939987 [23679] But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps, too
939987 [23680] busy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something. It appeared that
939987 [23681] everything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two constables
939987 [23682] were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had been ordered
939987 [23683] to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly maintaining
939987 [23684] that it was not his turn to go, but Akimâ€™s. But Akim was not to be seen.
939987 [23685] They ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.
939987 [23686] 
939987 [23687] â€œYou see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. Theyâ€™ve no shame!â€
939987 [23688] exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. â€œAkim gave you twenty-five copecks the day
939987 [23689] before yesterday. Youâ€™ve drunk it all and now you cry out. Iâ€™m simply
939987 [23690] surprised at your good-nature, with our low peasants, Mavriky
939987 [23691] Mavrikyevitch, thatâ€™s all I can say.â€
939987 [23692] 
939987 [23693] â€œBut what do we want a second cart for?â€ Mitya put in. â€œLetâ€™s start with
939987 [23694] the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I wonâ€™t be unruly, I wonâ€™t run away from
939987 [23695] you, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?â€
939987 [23696] 
939987 [23697] â€œIâ€™ll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if youâ€™ve never been
939987 [23698] taught. Iâ€™m not â€˜old fellowâ€™ to you, and you can keep your advice for
939987 [23699] another time!â€ Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as though glad
939987 [23700] to vent his wrath.
939987 [23701] 
939987 [23702] Mitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment later he felt
939987 [23703] suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was still
939987 [23704] overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face.
939987 [23705] 
939987 [23706] â€œIâ€™ve taken a chill,â€ thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.
939987 [23707] 
939987 [23708] At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down heavily,
939987 [23709] and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the corner. It is
939987 [23710] true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had been
939987 [23711] laid upon him.
939987 [23712] 
939987 [23713] â€œGood-by, Trifon Borissovitch!â€ Mitya shouted again, and felt himself,
939987 [23714] that he had not called out this time from good-nature, but involuntarily,
939987 [23715] from resentment.
939987 [23716] 
939987 [23717] But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his back,
939987 [23718] and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he made no
939987 [23719] reply.
939987 [23720] 
939987 [23721] â€œGood-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!â€ he heard all at once the voice of
939987 [23722] Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he held out
939987 [23723] his hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.
939987 [23724] 
939987 [23725] Mitya had time to seize and press his hand.
939987 [23726] 
939987 [23727] â€œGood-by, dear fellow! I shanâ€™t forget your generosity,â€ he cried warmly.
939987 [23728] 
939987 [23729] But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and
939987 [23730] Mitya was driven off.
939987 [23731] 
939987 [23732] Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face in
939987 [23733] his hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that, crying
939987 [23734] as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty. Oh, he
939987 [23735] believed almost without doubt in Mityaâ€™s guilt.
939987 [23736] 
939987 [23737] â€œWhat are these people? What can men be after this?â€ he exclaimed
939987 [23738] incoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that moment he had
939987 [23739] no desire to live.
939987 [23740] 
939987 [23741] â€œIs it worth it? Is it worth it?â€ exclaimed the boy in his grief.
939987 [23742] 
939987 [23743] 
939987 [23744]

939987 [23755] 
939987 [23756] Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin
939987 [23757] 
939987 [23758] 
939987 [23759] It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost, eleven
939987 [23760] degrees RÃ©aumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the
939987 [23761] frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and
939987 [23762] blowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the
939987 [23763] market-place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.
939987 [23764] 
939987 [23765] Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikovâ€™s shop, there stood a
939987 [23766] small house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to Madame
939987 [23767] Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been dead
939987 [23768] for fourteen years. His widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two,
939987 [23769] was living in her neat little house on her private means. She lived in
939987 [23770] respectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition.
939987 [23771] She was about eighteen at the time of her husbandâ€™s death; she had been
939987 [23772] married only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of his
939987 [23773] death she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her
939987 [23774] precious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately
939987 [23775] those fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than happiness.
939987 [23776] She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid
939987 [23777] he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a
939987 [23778] chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When Kolya began going to
939987 [23779] school, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him
939987 [23780] so as to help him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened to
939987 [23781] make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to
939987 [23782] Kolyaâ€™s schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving
939987 [23783] Kolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far
939987 [23784] that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him
939987 [23785] with being a â€œmotherâ€™s darling.â€
939987 [23786] 
939987 [23787] But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy, â€œtremendously
939987 [23788] strong,â€ as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to be the fact; he
939987 [23789] was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper. He
939987 [23790] was good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he could
939987 [23791] beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Though
939987 [23792] he looked down upon every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious.
939987 [23793] He accepted his schoolfellowsâ€™ respect as his due, but was friendly with
939987 [23794] them. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself
939987 [23795] on occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped
939987 [23796] that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach
939987 [23797] of discipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion
939987 [23798] as the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of
939987 [23799] mischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something
939987 [23800] effective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make even
939987 [23801] his mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her.
939987 [23802] She gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one
939987 [23803] thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her. She
939987 [23804] was always fancying that Kolya was â€œunfeelingâ€ to her, and at times,
939987 [23805] dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him with his
939987 [23806] coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feeling
939987 [23807] were demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them. Yet
939987 [23808] it was not intentional on his part but instinctiveâ€”it was his character.
939987 [23809] His mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He only disliked
939987 [23810] â€œsheepish sentimentality,â€ as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.
939987 [23811] 
939987 [23812] There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his
939987 [23813] fatherâ€™s. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them by
939987 [23814] himself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at
939987 [23815] seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead
939987 [23816] of going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for
939987 [23817] his age.
939987 [23818] 
939987 [23819] Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his mischief, he
939987 [23820] had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm. It
939987 [23821] is true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild mad
939987 [23822] recklessness.
939987 [23823] 
939987 [23824] It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and son
939987 [23825] went to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with a
939987 [23826] distant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway station
939987 [23827] (the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month later
939987 [23828] Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There Kolya began by
939987 [23829] carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowing
939987 [23830] that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly
939987 [23831] acquired knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the place
939987 [23832] with whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the station,
939987 [23833] others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all between
939987 [23834] twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town. The boys played
939987 [23835] together, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolyaâ€™s stay at the station, a
939987 [23836] mad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest
939987 [23837] of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was
939987 [23838] moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he
939987 [23839] would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven oâ€™clock train
939987 [23840] was due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over
939987 [23841] him at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation, from
939987 [23842] which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails
939987 [23843] that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was no
939987 [23844] joke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at
939987 [23845] him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on.
939987 [23846] What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses
939987 [23847] at him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as â€œa
939987 [23848] small boy,â€ not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable
939987 [23849] insult.
939987 [23850] 
939987 [23851] And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station,
939987 [23852] so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the
939987 [23853] station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. At
939987 [23854] the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had
939987 [23855] taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts
939987 [23856] beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last
939987 [23857] they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.
939987 [23858] Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it
939987 [23859] approached.
939987 [23860] 
939987 [23861] â€œRun, run away from the rails,â€ the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes,
939987 [23862] breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew
939987 [23863] past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling
939987 [23864] at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word.
939987 [23865] Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to
939987 [23866] frighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as
939987 [23867] he confessed long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as â€œa
939987 [23868] desperate character,â€ was established for ever. He returned home to the
939987 [23869] station as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous
939987 [23870] fever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The
939987 [23871] incident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the town
939987 [23872] it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters. But
939987 [23873] then Kolyaâ€™s mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boyâ€™s behalf,
939987 [23874] and in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exerted
939987 [23875] himself in his favor, and the affair was ignored.
939987 [23876] 
939987 [23877] Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in love
939987 [23878] with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about a
939987 [23879] year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of his
939987 [23880] sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage. But she
939987 [23881] refused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an act of
939987 [23882] treachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certain
939987 [23883] mysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an object of
939987 [23884] aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolyaâ€™s
939987 [23885] mad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for
939987 [23886] his intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was
939987 [23887] a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy
939987 [23888] that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy. He was
939987 [23889] fond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win
939987 [23890] him over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, kept
939987 [23891] him at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he was
939987 [23892] second in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class
939987 [23893] firmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he could
939987 [23894] â€œbeatâ€ even Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, â€œWho
939987 [23895] founded Troy?â€ to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring
939987 [23896] to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period,
939987 [23897] to the mythical legends. But the question, â€œWho had founded Troy?â€ that
939987 [23898] is, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for some reason
939987 [23899] regarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the boys remained
939987 [23900] convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of
939987 [23901] the founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in
939987 [23902] his fatherâ€™s bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the
939987 [23903] question, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell
939987 [23904] his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.
939987 [23905] 
939987 [23906] After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolyaâ€™s
939987 [23907] attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard of
939987 [23908] her sonâ€™s exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She had
939987 [23909] such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several
939987 [23910] days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor that
939987 [23911] such pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the
939987 [23912] holy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkinâ€™s
939987 [23913] instance, and the â€œmanlyâ€ Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And
939987 [23914] all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each otherâ€™s
939987 [23915] arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as â€œunfeelingâ€ as before, but he had
939987 [23916] become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.
939987 [23917] 
939987 [23918] Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even
939987 [23919] brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a
939987 [23920] scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as it
939987 [23921] turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.
939987 [23922] But of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more
939987 [23923] uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must be
939987 [23924] noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelovâ€™s heart
939987 [23925] and, of course, despised him profoundly for his â€œfeelingsâ€; he had in the
939987 [23926] past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting
939987 [23927] vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the
939987 [23928] railway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not
939987 [23929] allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more
939987 [23930] respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman at
939987 [23931] once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the slightest mention of
939987 [23932] Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolyaâ€™s presence, she would flush as pink as a
939987 [23933] rose. At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling,
939987 [23934] or would investigate the state of his boots, or would shout angrily for
939987 [23935] â€œPerezvon,â€ the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month
939987 [23936] before, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not
939987 [23937] showing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully,
939987 [23938] teaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him
939987 [23939] whenever he was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with
939987 [23940] delight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground
939987 [23941] pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he had
939987 [23942] taught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of his
939987 [23943] excited and grateful heart.
939987 [23944] 
939987 [23945] I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy
939987 [23946] stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son
939987 [23947] of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when the
939987 [23948] schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname â€œwisp of tow.â€

939987 [23953] 
939987 [23954] 
939987 [23955] And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkin
939987 [23956] was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school. It had just
939987 [23957] struck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out â€œon very urgent
939987 [23958] business,â€ but he was left alone in charge of the house, for it so
939987 [23959] happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and
939987 [23960] singular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated from
939987 [23961] the rest of the house by a passage, to a doctorâ€™s wife with her two small
939987 [23962] children. This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great
939987 [23963] friend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve
939987 [23964] months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the
939987 [23965] last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it not been for her
939987 [23966] friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to the
939987 [23967] forsaken lady, she would certainly have completely dissolved away in
939987 [23968] tears. And now, to add to her misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was
939987 [23969] suddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her mistressâ€™s
939987 [23970] amazement, that she proposed to bring a child into the world before
939987 [23971] morning. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed
939987 [23972] the probability of it before. The astounded doctorâ€™s wife decided to move
939987 [23973] Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept
939987 [23974] by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant,
939987 [23975] she promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her.
939987 [23976] By the morning all Madame Krassotkinâ€™s friendly sympathy and energy were
939987 [23977] called upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the
939987 [23978] case.
939987 [23979] 
939987 [23980] So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkinsâ€™ servant,
939987 [23981] Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time to
939987 [23982] protect and look after â€œthe kids,â€ that is, the son and daughter of the
939987 [23983] doctorâ€™s wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking care of
939987 [23984] the house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without
939987 [23985] moving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro
939987 [23986] through the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two
939987 [23987] loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the
939987 [23988] whistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless
939987 [23989] dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that
939987 [23990] troubled Kolya was â€œthe kids.â€ He looked, of course, with the utmost scorn
939987 [23991] on Katerinaâ€™s unexpected adventure, but he was very fond of the bereaved
939987 [23992] â€œkiddies,â€ and had already taken them a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, a
939987 [23993] girl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond
939987 [23994] of being read to by her. Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more
939987 [23995] diverting entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side by
939987 [23996] side and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the
939987 [23997] house. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so
939987 [23998] much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses
939987 [23999] with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like a
939987 [24000] trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out
939987 [24001] that to play horses with boys of oneâ€™s own age, boys of thirteen, would
939987 [24002] certainly be disgraceful â€œat this date,â€ but that he did it for the sake
939987 [24003] of â€œthe kidsâ€ because he liked them, and no one had a right to call him to
939987 [24004] account for his feelings. The two â€œkidsâ€ adored him.
939987 [24005] 
939987 [24006] But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very important
939987 [24007] business of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhile
939987 [24008] time was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children,
939987 [24009] would not come back from market. He had several times already crossed the
939987 [24010] passage, opened the door of the lodgersâ€™ room and looked anxiously at â€œthe
939987 [24011] kidsâ€ who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he
939987 [24012] opened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do
939987 [24013] something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not go
939987 [24014] in.
939987 [24015] 
939987 [24016] At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if
939987 [24017] that â€œdamnedâ€ Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out
939987 [24018] without waiting for her, making â€œthe kidsâ€ promise, of course, to be brave
939987 [24019] when he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright. With this
939987 [24020] idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar,
939987 [24021] slung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his motherâ€™s
939987 [24022] constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in
939987 [24023] such cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall
939987 [24024] and went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor
939987 [24025] clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with his
939987 [24026] tail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya,
939987 [24027] seeing his dogâ€™s passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach of
939987 [24028] discipline, kept him for another minute under the bench, and only when he
939987 [24029] had opened the door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up
939987 [24030] like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.
939987 [24031] 
939987 [24032] Kolya opened the door to peep at â€œthe kids.â€ They were both sitting as
939987 [24033] before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something. The
939987 [24034] children often argued together about various exciting problems of life,
939987 [24035] and Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya did not
939987 [24036] agree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his
939987 [24037] verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time the â€œkidsâ€™â€
939987 [24038] discussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage
939987 [24039] to listen. The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute
939987 [24040] with even greater energy.
939987 [24041] 
939987 [24042] â€œI shall never, never believe,â€ Nastya prattled, â€œthat the old women find
939987 [24043] babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. Itâ€™s winter now and there
939987 [24044] are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldnâ€™t have taken Katerina a
939987 [24045] daughter.â€
939987 [24046] 
939987 [24047] Kolya whistled to himself.
939987 [24048] 
939987 [24049] â€œOr perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who are
939987 [24050] married.â€
939987 [24051] 
939987 [24052] Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.
939987 [24053] 
939987 [24054] â€œNastya, how silly you are!â€ he said at last, firmly and calmly. â€œHow can
939987 [24055] Katerina have a baby when she isnâ€™t married?â€
939987 [24056] 
939987 [24057] Nastya was exasperated.
939987 [24058] 
939987 [24059] â€œYou know nothing about it,â€ she snapped irritably. â€œPerhaps she has a
939987 [24060] husband, only he is in prison, so now sheâ€™s got a baby.â€
939987 [24061] 
939987 [24062] â€œBut is her husband in prison?â€ the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired
939987 [24063] gravely.
939987 [24064] 
939987 [24065] â€œOr, I tell you what,â€ Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely
939987 [24066] rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. â€œShe hasnâ€™t a husband, you
939987 [24067] are right there, but she wants to be married, and so sheâ€™s been thinking
939987 [24068] of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now sheâ€™s got it,
939987 [24069] that is, not a husband but a baby.â€
939987 [24070] 
939987 [24071] â€œWell, perhaps so,â€ Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. â€œBut you didnâ€™t
939987 [24072] say so before. So how could I tell?â€
939987 [24073] 
939987 [24074] â€œCome, kiddies,â€ said Kolya, stepping into the room. â€œYouâ€™re terrible
939987 [24075] people, I see.â€
939987 [24076] 
939987 [24077] â€œAnd Perezvon with you!â€ grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingers
939987 [24078] and calling Perezvon.
939987 [24079] 
939987 [24080] â€œI am in a difficulty, kids,â€ Krassotkin began solemnly, â€œand you must
939987 [24081] help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up till
939987 [24082] now, thatâ€™s certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?â€
939987 [24083] 
939987 [24084] The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showed
939987 [24085] signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of
939987 [24086] them.
939987 [24087] 
939987 [24088] â€œYou wonâ€™t be naughty while I am gone? You wonâ€™t climb on the cupboard and
939987 [24089] break your legs? You wonâ€™t be frightened alone and cry?â€
939987 [24090] 
939987 [24091] A look of profound despondency came into the childrenâ€™s faces.
939987 [24092] 
939987 [24093] â€œAnd I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon which
939987 [24094] can be fired with real gunpowder.â€
939987 [24095] 
939987 [24096] The childrenâ€™s faces instantly brightened. â€œShow us the cannon,â€ said
939987 [24097] Kostya, beaming all over.
939987 [24098] 
939987 [24099] Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronze
939987 [24100] cannon stood it on the table.
939987 [24101] 
939987 [24102] â€œAh, you are bound to ask that! Look, itâ€™s on wheels.â€ He rolled the toy
939987 [24103] on along the table. â€œAnd it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded with
939987 [24104] shot and fired off.â€
939987 [24105] 
939987 [24106] â€œAnd it could kill any one?â€
939987 [24107] 
939987 [24108] â€œIt can kill any one; youâ€™ve only got to aim at anybody,â€ and Krassotkin
939987 [24109] explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolled
939987 [24110] in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kicked
939987 [24111] when it was fired.
939987 [24112] 
939987 [24113] The children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck
939987 [24114] their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
939987 [24115] 
939987 [24116] â€œAnd have you got any powder?â€ Nastya inquired.
939987 [24117] 
939987 [24118] â€œYes.â€
939987 [24119] 
939987 [24120] â€œShow us the powder, too,â€ she drawled with a smile of entreaty.
939987 [24121] 
939987 [24122] Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask
939987 [24123] containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw of
939987 [24124] paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm
939987 [24125] of his hand.
939987 [24126] 
939987 [24127] â€œOne has to be careful thereâ€™s no fire about, or it would blow up and kill
939987 [24128] us all,â€ Krassotkin warned them sensationally.
939987 [24129] 
939987 [24130] The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only
939987 [24131] intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.
939987 [24132] 
939987 [24133] â€œAnd does the shot burn?â€ he inquired.
939987 [24134] 
939987 [24135] â€œNo, it doesnâ€™t.â€
939987 [24136] 
939987 [24137] â€œGive me a little shot,â€ he asked in an imploring voice.
939987 [24138] 
939987 [24139] â€œIâ€™ll give you a little shot; here, take it, but donâ€™t show it to your
939987 [24140] mother till I come back, or sheâ€™ll be sure to think itâ€™s gunpowder, and
939987 [24141] will die of fright and give you a thrashing.â€
939987 [24142] 
939987 [24143] â€œMother never does whip us,â€ Nastya observed at once.
939987 [24144] 
939987 [24145] â€œI know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And donâ€™t you ever deceive
939987 [24146] your mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can
939987 [24147] I go out? You wonâ€™t be frightened and cry when Iâ€™m gone?â€
939987 [24148] 
939987 [24149] â€œWe shaâ€”all cry,â€ drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.
939987 [24150] 
939987 [24151] â€œWe shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,â€ Nastya chimed in with timid
939987 [24152] haste.
939987 [24153] 
939987 [24154] â€œOh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! Thereâ€™s no
939987 [24155] help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I donâ€™t know how
939987 [24156] long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!â€
939987 [24157] 
939987 [24158] â€œTell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!â€ Kostya begged.
939987 [24159] 
939987 [24160] â€œThereâ€™s no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. _Ici_,
939987 [24161] Perezvon.â€ And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his
939987 [24162] tricks.
939987 [24163] 
939987 [24164] He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of
939987 [24165] lilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was
939987 [24166] torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on his
939987 [24167] back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While this
939987 [24168] last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame
939987 [24169] Krassotkinâ€™s servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox,
939987 [24170] appeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag full
939987 [24171] of provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her left
939987 [24172] hand she stood still to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious
939987 [24173] for her return, he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping
939987 [24174] Perezvon dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog
939987 [24175] jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.
939987 [24176] 
939987 [24177] â€œOnly think, a dog!â€ Agafya observed sententiously.
939987 [24178] 
939987 [24179] â€œWhy are you late, female?â€ asked Krassotkin sternly.
939987 [24180] 
939987 [24181] â€œFemale, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.â€
939987 [24182] 
939987 [24183] â€œBrat?â€
939987 [24184] 
939987 [24185] â€œYes, a brat. What is it to you if Iâ€™m late; if Iâ€™m late, you may be sure
939987 [24186] I have good reason,â€ muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove,
939987 [24187] without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed quite
939987 [24188] pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master.
939987 [24189] 
939987 [24190] â€œListen, you frivolous young woman,â€ Krassotkin began, getting up from the
939987 [24191] sofa, â€œcan you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something
939987 [24192] else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence?
939987 [24193] I am going out.â€
939987 [24194] 
939987 [24195] â€œAnd what am I going to swear for?â€ laughed Agafya. â€œI shall look after
939987 [24196] them without that.â€
939987 [24197] 
939987 [24198] â€œNo, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shanâ€™t go.â€
939987 [24199] 
939987 [24200] â€œWell, donâ€™t then. What does it matter to me? Itâ€™s cold out; stay at
939987 [24201] home.â€
939987 [24202] 
939987 [24203] â€œKids,â€ Kolya turned to the children, â€œthis woman will stay with you till
939987 [24204] I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been back
939987 [24205] long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. Youâ€™ll give them something,
939987 [24206] Agafya, wonâ€™t you?â€
939987 [24207] 
939987 [24208] â€œThat I can do.â€
939987 [24209] 
939987 [24210] â€œGood-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,â€ he added
939987 [24211] gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, â€œI hope youâ€™ll spare their
939987 [24212] tender years and not tell them any of your old womanâ€™s nonsense about
939987 [24213] Katerina. _Ici_, Perezvon!â€
939987 [24214] 
939987 [24215] â€œGet along with you!â€ retorted Agafya, really angry this time. â€œRidiculous
939987 [24216] boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, thatâ€™s what you want!â€
939987 [24217] 
939987 [24218] 
939987 [24219] 
939987 [24220] Chapter III. The Schoolboy
939987 [24221] 
939987 [24222] 
939987 [24223] But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at the
939987 [24224] gate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying â€œIt is
939987 [24225] freezing,â€ went straight along the street and turned off to the right
939987 [24226] towards the market-place. When he reached the last house but one before
939987 [24227] the market-place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of his
939987 [24228] pocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal. He had
939987 [24229] not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven,
939987 [24230] wearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This
939987 [24231] was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya
939987 [24232] Krassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden by
939987 [24233] his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a
939987 [24234] desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly.
939987 [24235] He wasâ€”if the reader has not forgottenâ€”one of the group of boys who two
939987 [24236] months before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the one who told Alyosha
939987 [24237] Karamazov about Ilusha.
939987 [24238] 
939987 [24239] â€œIâ€™ve been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,â€ said Smurov
939987 [24240] stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.
939987 [24241] 
939987 [24242] â€œI am late,â€ answered Krassotkin. â€œI was detained by circumstances. You
939987 [24243] wonâ€™t be thrashed for coming with me?â€
939987 [24244] 
939987 [24245] â€œCome, I say, Iâ€™m never thrashed! And youâ€™ve got Perezvon with you?â€
939987 [24246] 
939987 [24247] â€œYes.â€
939987 [24248] 
939987 [24249] â€œYouâ€™re taking him, too?â€
939987 [24250] 
939987 [24251] â€œYes.â€
939987 [24252] 
939987 [24253] â€œAh! if it were only Zhutchka!â€
939987 [24254] 
939987 [24255] â€œThatâ€™s impossible. Zhutchkaâ€™s non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mists
939987 [24256] of obscurity.â€
939987 [24257] 
939987 [24258] â€œAh! couldnâ€™t we do this?â€ Smurov suddenly stood still. â€œYou see Ilusha
939987 [24259] says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon.
939987 [24260] Couldnâ€™t you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe you?â€
939987 [24261] 
939987 [24262] â€œBoy, shun a lie, thatâ€™s one thing; even with a good objectâ€”thatâ€™s
939987 [24263] another. Above all, I hope youâ€™ve not told them anything about my coming.â€
939987 [24264] 
939987 [24265] â€œHeaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you wonâ€™t comfort him with
939987 [24266] Perezvon,â€ said Smurov, with a sigh. â€œYou know his father, the captain,
939987 [24267] â€˜the wisp of tow,â€™ told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff
939987 [24268] pup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I
939987 [24269] doubt it.â€
939987 [24270] 
939987 [24271] â€œAnd how is Ilusha?â€
939987 [24272] 
939987 [24273] â€œAh, he is bad, very bad! I believe heâ€™s in consumption: he is quite
939987 [24274] conscious, but his breathing! His breathingâ€™s gone wrong. The other day he
939987 [24275] asked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to walk, but
939987 [24276] he couldnâ€™t stand. â€˜Ah, I told you before, father,â€™ he said, â€˜that those
939987 [24277] boots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.â€™ He fancied it
939987 [24278] was his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really.
939987 [24279] He wonâ€™t live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they are
939987 [24280] rich againâ€”theyâ€™ve got heaps of money.â€
939987 [24281] 
939987 [24282] â€œThey are rogues.â€
939987 [24283] 
939987 [24284] â€œWho are rogues?â€
939987 [24285] 
939987 [24286] â€œDoctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of course,
939987 [24287] individually. I donâ€™t believe in medicine. Itâ€™s a useless institution. I
939987 [24288] mean to go into all that. But whatâ€™s that sentimentality youâ€™ve got up
939987 [24289] there? The whole class seems to be there every day.â€
939987 [24290] 
939987 [24291] â€œNot the whole class: itâ€™s only ten of our fellows who go to see him every
939987 [24292] day. Thereâ€™s nothing in that.â€
939987 [24293] 
939987 [24294] â€œWhat I donâ€™t understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is
939987 [24295] taking in it. His brotherâ€™s going to be tried to-morrow or next day for
939987 [24296] such a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with
939987 [24297] boys.â€
939987 [24298] 
939987 [24299] â€œThereâ€™s no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make it
939987 [24300] up with Ilusha.â€
939987 [24301] 
939987 [24302] â€œMake it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one to
939987 [24303] analyze my actions.â€
939987 [24304] 
939987 [24305] â€œAnd how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you are
939987 [24306] coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldnâ€™t come all this time?â€ Smurov
939987 [24307] cried with sudden warmth.
939987 [24308] 
939987 [24309] â€œMy dear boy, thatâ€™s my business, not yours. I am going of myself because
939987 [24310] I choose to, but youâ€™ve all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazovâ€”thereâ€™s
939987 [24311] a difference, you know. And how do you know? I may not be going to make it
939987 [24312] up at all. Itâ€™s a stupid expression.â€
939987 [24313] 
939987 [24314] â€œItâ€™s not Karamazov at all; itâ€™s not his doing. Our fellows began going
939987 [24315] there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And
939987 [24316] thereâ€™s been nothing of that sortâ€”no silliness. First one went, and then
939987 [24317] another. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply
939987 [24318] go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilushaâ€™s dying. And he
939987 [24319] seems so glad weâ€™ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that
939987 [24320] was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind
939987 [24321] or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very
939987 [24322] decent man. We made a mistake then. Itâ€™s all the fault of that murderer
939987 [24323] who beat him then.â€
939987 [24324] 
939987 [24325] â€œKaramazovâ€™s a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his
939987 [24326] acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.
939987 [24327] Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.â€
939987 [24328] 
939987 [24329] Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, of
939987 [24330] course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a
939987 [24331] level with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolyaâ€™s saying that
939987 [24332] he was â€œgoing of himselfâ€ to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be some
939987 [24333] mystery in Kolyaâ€™s suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day.
939987 [24334] They crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded
939987 [24335] wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market women
939987 [24336] were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These
939987 [24337] Sunday markets were naÃ¯vely called â€œfairsâ€ in the town, and there were
939987 [24338] many such fairs in the year.
939987 [24339] 
939987 [24340] Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side,
939987 [24341] then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other
939987 [24342] over according to the rules of canine etiquette.
939987 [24343] 
939987 [24344] â€œI like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,â€ said Kolya suddenly.
939987 [24345] â€œHave you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It seems
939987 [24346] to be a law of their nature.â€
939987 [24347] 
939987 [24348] â€œYes; itâ€™s a funny habit.â€
939987 [24349] 
939987 [24350] â€œNo, itâ€™s not funny; you are wrong there. Thereâ€™s nothing funny in nature,
939987 [24351] however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs could reason
939987 [24352] and criticize us theyâ€™d be sure to find just as much that would be funny
939987 [24353] to them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, their
939987 [24354] mastersâ€”far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am convinced that there
939987 [24355] is far more foolishness among us. Thatâ€™s Rakitinâ€™s ideaâ€”a remarkable idea.
939987 [24356] I am a Socialist, Smurov.â€
939987 [24357] 
939987 [24358] â€œAnd what is a Socialist?â€ asked Smurov.
939987 [24359] 
939987 [24360] â€œThatâ€™s when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no
939987 [24361] marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best, and all
939987 [24362] the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet. Itâ€™s cold,
939987 [24363] though.â€
939987 [24364] 
939987 [24365] â€œYes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just now.â€
939987 [24366] 
939987 [24367] â€œHave you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we donâ€™t feel so
939987 [24368] cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do
939987 [24369] now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelve
939987 [24370] degrees, especially when there is not much snow. Itâ€™s because people are
939987 [24371] not used to it. Everything is habit with men, everything even in their
939987 [24372] social and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What a
939987 [24373] funny-looking peasant!â€
939987 [24374] 
939987 [24375] Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a long
939987 [24376] sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together his
939987 [24377] hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long fair
939987 [24378] beard was all white with frost.
939987 [24379] 
939987 [24380] â€œThat peasantâ€™s beardâ€™s frozen,â€ Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice
939987 [24381] as he passed him.
939987 [24382] 
939987 [24383] â€œLots of peopleâ€™s beards are frozen,â€ the peasant replied, calmly and
939987 [24384] sententiously.
939987 [24385] 
939987 [24386] â€œDonâ€™t provoke him,â€ observed Smurov.
939987 [24387] 
939987 [24388] â€œItâ€™s all right; he wonâ€™t be cross; heâ€™s a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.â€
939987 [24389] 
939987 [24390] â€œGood-by.â€
939987 [24391] 
939987 [24392] â€œIs your name Matvey?â€
939987 [24393] 
939987 [24394] â€œYes. Didnâ€™t you know?â€
939987 [24395] 
939987 [24396] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t. It was a guess.â€
939987 [24397] 
939987 [24398] â€œYou donâ€™t say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?â€
939987 [24399] 
939987 [24400] â€œYes.â€
939987 [24401] 
939987 [24402] â€œYou get whipped, I expect?â€
939987 [24403] 
939987 [24404] â€œNothing to speak ofâ€”sometimes.â€
939987 [24405] 
939987 [24406] â€œDoes it hurt?â€
939987 [24407] 
939987 [24408] â€œWell, yes, it does.â€
939987 [24409] 
939987 [24410] â€œEch, what a life!â€ The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his
939987 [24411] heart.
939987 [24412] 
939987 [24413] â€œGood-by, Matvey.â€
939987 [24414] 
939987 [24415] â€œGood-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.â€
939987 [24416] 
939987 [24417] The boys went on.
939987 [24418] 
939987 [24419] â€œThat was a nice peasant,â€ Kolya observed to Smurov. â€œI like talking to
939987 [24420] the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.â€
939987 [24421] 
939987 [24422] â€œWhy did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?â€ asked Smurov.
939987 [24423] 
939987 [24424] â€œI had to say that to please him.â€
939987 [24425] 
939987 [24426] â€œHow do you mean?â€
939987 [24427] 
939987 [24428] â€œYou know, Smurov, I donâ€™t like being asked the same thing twice. I like
939987 [24429] people to understand at the first word. Some things canâ€™t be explained.
939987 [24430] According to a peasantâ€™s notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must be
939987 [24431] whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped? And if I were
939987 [24432] to tell him we are not, heâ€™d be disappointed. But you donâ€™t understand
939987 [24433] that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.â€
939987 [24434] 
939987 [24435] â€œOnly donâ€™t tease them, please, or youâ€™ll get into another scrape as you
939987 [24436] did about that goose.â€
939987 [24437] 
939987 [24438] â€œSo youâ€™re afraid?â€
939987 [24439] 
939987 [24440] â€œDonâ€™t laugh, Kolya. Of course Iâ€™m afraid. My father would be awfully
939987 [24441] cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.â€
939987 [24442] 
939987 [24443] â€œDonâ€™t be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!â€ he
939987 [24444] shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.
939987 [24445] 
939987 [24446] â€œCall me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,â€ the middle-aged market
939987 [24447] woman shouted at him.
939987 [24448] 
939987 [24449] â€œI am so glad itâ€™s Marya. Good-by!â€
939987 [24450] 
939987 [24451] â€œAh, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!â€
939987 [24452] 
939987 [24453] â€œIâ€™m in a hurry. I canâ€™t stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.â€ Kolya
939987 [24454] waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he her.
939987 [24455] 
939987 [24456] â€œIâ€™ve nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent young
939987 [24457] monkey. I didnâ€™t say anything,â€ bawled Marya. â€œYou want a whipping, thatâ€™s
939987 [24458] what you want, you saucy jackanapes!â€
939987 [24459] 
939987 [24460] There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her.
939987 [24461] Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close
939987 [24462] by. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hair
939987 [24463] and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and
939987 [24464] a peaked cap, and looked like a merchantâ€™s clerk. He was in a state of
939987 [24465] stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.
939987 [24466] 
939987 [24467] â€œI know you!â€ he cried angrily, â€œI know you!â€
939987 [24468] 
939987 [24469] Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row with
939987 [24470] the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could
939987 [24471] hardly remember them all.
939987 [24472] 
939987 [24473] â€œDo you?â€ he asked sarcastically.
939987 [24474] 
939987 [24475] â€œI know you! I know you!â€ the man repeated idiotically.
939987 [24476] 
939987 [24477] â€œSo much the better for you. Well, itâ€™s time I was going. Good-by!â€
939987 [24478] 
939987 [24479] â€œYou are at your saucy pranks again?â€ cried the man. â€œYou are at your
939987 [24480] saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!â€
939987 [24481] 
939987 [24482] â€œItâ€™s not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,â€ said
939987 [24483] Kolya, standing still and scanning him.
939987 [24484] 
939987 [24485] â€œNot my business?â€
939987 [24486] 
939987 [24487] â€œNo; itâ€™s not your business.â€
939987 [24488] 
939987 [24489] â€œWhose then? Whose then? Whose then?â€
939987 [24490] 
939987 [24491] â€œItâ€™s Trifon Nikititchâ€™s business, not yours.â€
939987 [24492] 
939987 [24493] â€œWhat Trifon Nikititch?â€ asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement
939987 [24494] at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.
939987 [24495] 
939987 [24496] Kolya scanned him gravely.
939987 [24497] 
939987 [24498] â€œHave you been to the Church of the Ascension?â€ he suddenly asked him,
939987 [24499] with stern emphasis.
939987 [24500] 
939987 [24501] â€œWhat Church of Ascension? What for? No, I havenâ€™t,â€ said the young man,
939987 [24502] somewhat taken aback.
939987 [24503] 
939987 [24504] â€œDo you know Sabaneyev?â€ Kolya went on even more emphatically and even
939987 [24505] more severely.
939987 [24506] 
939987 [24507] â€œWhat Sabaneyev? No, I donâ€™t know him.â€
939987 [24508] 
939987 [24509] â€œWell then you can go to the devil,â€ said Kolya, cutting short the
939987 [24510] conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his
939987 [24511] way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not
939987 [24512] even know Sabaneyev.
939987 [24513] 
939987 [24514] â€œStop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?â€ the young man recovered from his momentary
939987 [24515] stupefaction and was as excited as before. â€œWhat did he say?â€ He turned to
939987 [24516] the market women with a silly stare.
939987 [24517] 
939987 [24518] The women laughed.
939987 [24519] 
939987 [24520] â€œYou can never tell what heâ€™s after,â€ said one of them.
939987 [24521] 
939987 [24522] â€œWhat Sabaneyev is it heâ€™s talking about?â€ the young man repeated, still
939987 [24523] furious and brandishing his right arm.
939987 [24524] 
939987 [24525] â€œIt must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, thatâ€™s who it must
939987 [24526] be,â€ one of the women suggested.
939987 [24527] 
939987 [24528] The young man stared at her wildly.
939987 [24529] 
939987 [24530] â€œFor the Kuzmitchovs?â€ repeated another woman. â€œBut his name wasnâ€™t
939987 [24531] Trifon. His nameâ€™s Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch,
939987 [24532] so it canâ€™t be the same.â€
939987 [24533] 
939987 [24534] â€œHis name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, itâ€™s Tchizhov,â€ put in suddenly
939987 [24535] a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely. â€œAlexey
939987 [24536] Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.â€
939987 [24537] 
939987 [24538] â€œNot a doubt about it, itâ€™s Tchizhov,â€ a fourth woman emphatically
939987 [24539] confirmed the statement.
939987 [24540] 
939987 [24541] The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.
939987 [24542] 
939987 [24543] â€œBut what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?â€ he cried
939987 [24544] almost in desperation. â€œ â€˜Do you know Sabaneyev?â€™ says he. And who the
939987 [24545] devilâ€™s to know who is Sabaneyev?â€
939987 [24546] 
939987 [24547] â€œYouâ€™re a senseless fellow. I tell you itâ€™s not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov,
939987 [24548] Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, thatâ€™s who it is!â€ one of the women shouted at
939987 [24549] him impressively.
939987 [24550] 
939987 [24551] â€œWhat Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.â€
939987 [24552] 
939987 [24553] â€œThat tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.â€
939987 [24554] 
939987 [24555] â€œAnd whatâ€™s your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?â€
939987 [24556] 
939987 [24557] â€œHow can I tell what heâ€™s to do with you?â€ put in another. â€œYou ought to
939987 [24558] know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor about him.
939987 [24559] He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Donâ€™t you really know
939987 [24560] him?â€
939987 [24561] 
939987 [24562] â€œKnow whom?â€
939987 [24563] 
939987 [24564] â€œTchizhov.â€
939987 [24565] 
939987 [24566] â€œThe devil take Tchizhov and you with him. Iâ€™ll give him a hiding, that I
939987 [24567] will. He was laughing at me!â€
939987 [24568] 
939987 [24569] â€œWill give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are a
939987 [24570] fool, thatâ€™s what you are!â€
939987 [24571] 
939987 [24572] â€œNot Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. Iâ€™ll give
939987 [24573] the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!â€
939987 [24574] 
939987 [24575] The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along
939987 [24576] with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at the
939987 [24577] shouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was still
939987 [24578] afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolyaâ€™s company.
939987 [24579] 
939987 [24580] â€œWhat Sabaneyev did you mean?â€ he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his answer
939987 [24581] would be.
939987 [24582] 
939987 [24583] â€œHow do I know? Now thereâ€™ll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to
939987 [24584] stir up fools in every class of society. Thereâ€™s another blockhead, that
939987 [24585] peasant there. You know, they say â€˜thereâ€™s no one stupider than a stupid
939987 [24586] Frenchman,â€™ but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much. Canâ€™t
939987 [24587] you see it all over his face that he is a fool, that peasant, eh?â€
939987 [24588] 
939987 [24589] â€œLet him alone, Kolya. Letâ€™s go on.â€
939987 [24590] 
939987 [24591] â€œNothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!â€
939987 [24592] 
939987 [24593] A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard,
939987 [24594] who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed not
939987 [24595] quite sober.
939987 [24596] 
939987 [24597] â€œGood morning, if you are not laughing at me,â€ he said deliberately in
939987 [24598] reply.
939987 [24599] 
939987 [24600] â€œAnd if I am?â€ laughed Kolya.
939987 [24601] 
939987 [24602] â€œWell, a jokeâ€™s a joke. Laugh away. I donâ€™t mind. Thereâ€™s no harm in a
939987 [24603] joke.â€
939987 [24604] 
939987 [24605] â€œI beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.â€
939987 [24606] 
939987 [24607] â€œWell, God forgive you!â€
939987 [24608] 
939987 [24609] â€œDo you forgive me, too?â€
939987 [24610] 
939987 [24611] â€œI quite forgive you. Go along.â€
939987 [24612] 
939987 [24613] â€œI say, you seem a clever peasant.â€
939987 [24614] 
939987 [24615] â€œCleverer than you,â€ the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same
939987 [24616] gravity.
939987 [24617] 
939987 [24618] â€œI doubt it,â€ said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
939987 [24619] 
939987 [24620] â€œItâ€™s true, though.â€
939987 [24621] 
939987 [24622] â€œPerhaps it is.â€
939987 [24623] 
939987 [24624] â€œIt is, brother.â€
939987 [24625] 
939987 [24626] â€œGood-by, peasant!â€
939987 [24627] 
939987 [24628] â€œGood-by!â€
939987 [24629] 
939987 [24630] â€œThere are all sorts of peasants,â€ Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief
939987 [24631] silence. â€œHow could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always ready to
939987 [24632] recognize intelligence in the peasantry.â€
939987 [24633] 
939987 [24634] In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The boys made
939987 [24635] haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryovâ€™s lodging, a
939987 [24636] considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces from
939987 [24637] the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov
939987 [24638] to come out to him.
939987 [24639] 
939987 [24640] â€œOne must sniff round a bit first,â€ he observed to Smurov.
939987 [24641] 
939987 [24642] â€œWhy ask him to come out?â€ Smurov protested. â€œYou go in; they will be
939987 [24643] awfully glad to see you. Whatâ€™s the sense of making friends in the frost
939987 [24644] out here?â€
939987 [24645] 
939987 [24646] â€œI know why I want to see him out here in the frost,â€ Kolya cut him short
939987 [24647] in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with â€œsmall boys,â€ and Smurov
939987 [24648] ran to do his bidding.
939987 [24649] 
939987 [24650] 
939987 [24651] 
939987 [24652] Chapter IV. The Lost Dog
939987 [24653] 
939987 [24654] 
939987 [24655] Kolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for Alyosha
939987 [24656] to appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had heard a great deal
939987 [24657] about him from the boys, but hitherto he had always maintained an
939987 [24658] appearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned, and he had
939987 [24659] even â€œcriticizedâ€ what he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a great
939987 [24660] longing to make his acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and
939987 [24661] attractive in all he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment was
939987 [24662] important: to begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show his
939987 [24663] independence, â€œOr heâ€™ll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy,
939987 [24664] like the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I shall ask him
939987 [24665] when I get to know him. Itâ€™s a pity I am so short, though. Tuzikov is
939987 [24666] younger than I am, yet he is half a head taller. But I have a clever face.
939987 [24667] I am not good-looking. I know Iâ€™m hideous, but Iâ€™ve a clever face. I
939987 [24668] mustnâ€™t talk too freely; if I fall into his arms all at once, he may
939987 [24669] thinkâ€”Tfoo! how horrible if he should thinkâ€”!â€
939987 [24670] 
939987 [24671] Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost to
939987 [24672] assume the most independent air. What distressed him most was his being so
939987 [24673] short; he did not mind so much his â€œhideousâ€ face, as being so short. On
939987 [24674] the wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark to
939987 [24675] show his height, and every two months since he anxiously measured himself
939987 [24676] against it to see how much he had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly,
939987 [24677] and this sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His face was in reality
939987 [24678] by no means â€œhideousâ€; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with a
939987 [24679] fair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively gray eyes had a fearless
939987 [24680] look, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high cheekbones; small,
939987 [24681] very red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and unmistakably
939987 [24682] turned up. â€œIâ€™ve a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,â€ Kolya used to
939987 [24683] mutter to himself when he looked in the looking-glass, and he always left
939987 [24684] it with indignation. â€œBut perhaps I havenâ€™t got a clever face?â€ he
939987 [24685] sometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But it must not be supposed that
939987 [24686] his mind was preoccupied with his face and his height. On the contrary,
939987 [24687] however bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him, he
939987 [24688] quickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, â€œabandoning himself
939987 [24689] entirely to ideas and to real life,â€ as he formulated it to himself.
939987 [24690] 
939987 [24691] Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he reached him,
939987 [24692] Kolya could see that he looked delighted. â€œCan he be so glad to see me?â€
939987 [24693] Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing, that
939987 [24694] Alyoshaâ€™s appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him
939987 [24695] last. He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a
939987 [24696] soft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this was very
939987 [24697] becoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His charming face always
939987 [24698] had a good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in
939987 [24699] his good-humor. To Kolyaâ€™s surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as he
939987 [24700] was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He held out his
939987 [24701] hand to Kolya at once.
939987 [24702] 
939987 [24703] â€œHere you are at last! How anxious weâ€™ve been to see you!â€
939987 [24704] 
939987 [24705] â€œThere were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to
939987 [24706] make your acquaintance. Iâ€™ve long been hoping for an opportunity, and have
939987 [24707] heard a great deal about you,â€ Kolya muttered, a little breathless.
939987 [24708] 
939987 [24709] â€œWe should have met anyway. Iâ€™ve heard a great deal about you, too; but
939987 [24710] youâ€™ve been a long time coming here.â€
939987 [24711] 
939987 [24712] â€œTell me, how are things going?â€
939987 [24713] 
939987 [24714] â€œIlusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.â€
939987 [24715] 
939987 [24716] â€œHow awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,â€ cried
939987 [24717] Kolya warmly.
939987 [24718] 
939987 [24719] â€œIlusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, in
939987 [24720] delirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to him
939987 [24721] ... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then thereâ€™s another
939987 [24722] reason.... Tell me, is that your dog?â€
939987 [24723] 
939987 [24724] â€œYes, Perezvon.â€
939987 [24725] 
939987 [24726] â€œNot Zhutchka?â€ Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. â€œIs she
939987 [24727] lost for ever?â€
939987 [24728] 
939987 [24729] â€œI know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. Iâ€™ve heard all about it.â€
939987 [24730] Kolya smiled mysteriously. â€œListen, Karamazov, Iâ€™ll tell you all about it.
939987 [24731] Thatâ€™s what I came for; thatâ€™s what I asked you to come out here for, to
939987 [24732] explain the whole episode to you before we go in,â€ he began with
939987 [24733] animation. â€œYou see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory class
939987 [24734] last spring. Well, you know what our preparatory class isâ€”a lot of small
939987 [24735] boys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and,
939987 [24736] of course, I only look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weak
939987 [24737] and small, but he wouldnâ€™t give in to them; he fought with them. I saw he
939987 [24738] was proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that. And
939987 [24739] they teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was horribly dressed
939987 [24740] at the time, his breeches were too small for him, and there were holes in
939987 [24741] his boots. They worried him about it; they jeered at him. That I canâ€™t
939987 [24742] stand. I stood up for him at once, and gave it to them hot. I beat them,
939987 [24743] but they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?â€ Kolya boasted impulsively;
939987 [24744] â€œbut I am always fond of children. Iâ€™ve two chickens in my hands at home
939987 [24745] nowâ€”thatâ€™s what detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I
939987 [24746] took him under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that,
939987 [24747] the boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he
939987 [24748] did my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copy
939987 [24749] me. In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once, and
939987 [24750] Iâ€™d go about with him. On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an older
939987 [24751] boy makes friends with a younger one like that; but thatâ€™s a prejudice. If
939987 [24752] itâ€™s my fancy, thatâ€™s enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Why
939987 [24753] shouldnâ€™t I develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken up
939987 [24754] with all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the younger
939987 [24755] generationâ€”to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you this
939987 [24756] trait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than
939987 [24757] anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was a sort
939987 [24758] of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have a
939987 [24759] positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from a
939987 [24760] baby. There were contradictions in him, too: he was proud, but he was
939987 [24761] slavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his eyes would flash and heâ€™d
939987 [24762] refuse to agree with me; heâ€™d argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to
939987 [24763] propound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he
939987 [24764] disagreed with the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me,
939987 [24765] because I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order to
939987 [24766] train him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became. I did it on
939987 [24767] purpose: that was my idea. My object was to form his character, to lick
939987 [24768] him into shape, to make a man of him ... and besides ... no doubt, you
939987 [24769] understand me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession
939987 [24770] he was downcast and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for
939987 [24771] something else, something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was.
939987 [24772] I have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know
939987 [24773] Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late fatherâ€”it was before his death,
939987 [24774] of courseâ€”and he taught the little fool a silly trickâ€”that is, a brutal,
939987 [24775] nasty trick. He told him to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it,
939987 [24776] and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without
939987 [24777] biting it, and then to watch and see what would happen. So they prepared a
939987 [24778] piece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog thereâ€™s
939987 [24779] been such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never fed
939987 [24780] it at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking,
939987 [24781] Karamazov? I canâ€™t stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, and
939987 [24782] began to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as it
939987 [24783] ran out of sight. That was Ilushaâ€™s own account of it. He confessed it to
939987 [24784] me, and cried bitterly. He hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on
939987 [24785] repeating â€˜He ran away squealingâ€™: the sight of that haunted him. He was
939987 [24786] tormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined
939987 [24787] to give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I wasnâ€™t
939987 [24788] quite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than I
939987 [24789] was. â€˜Youâ€™ve done a nasty thing,â€™ I said, â€˜you are a scoundrel. I wonâ€™t
939987 [24790] tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with you for a
939987 [24791] time. Iâ€™ll think it over and let you know through Smurovâ€™â€”thatâ€™s the boy
939987 [24792] whoâ€™s just come with me; heâ€™s always ready to do anything for meâ€”â€˜whether
939987 [24793] I will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up
939987 [24794] for good as a scoundrel.â€™ He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt Iâ€™d
939987 [24795] gone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I
939987 [24796] thought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him
939987 [24797] that I would not speak to him again. Thatâ€™s what we call it when two
939987 [24798] schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another.
939987 [24799] Secretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then, if
939987 [24800] I saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him again. That was my
939987 [24801] intention. But what do you think happened? He heard Smurovâ€™s message, his
939987 [24802] eyes flashed. â€˜Tell Krassotkin from me,â€™ he cried, â€˜that I will throw
939987 [24803] bread with pins to all the dogsâ€”allâ€”all of them!â€™ â€˜So heâ€™s going in for a
939987 [24804] little temper. We must smoke it out of him.â€™ And I began to treat him with
939987 [24805] contempt; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. And
939987 [24806] just then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You must
939987 [24807] realize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already. The
939987 [24808] boys, seeing Iâ€™d given him up, set on him and taunted him, shouting, â€˜Wisp
939987 [24809] of tow, wisp of tow!â€™ And he had soon regular skirmishes with them, which
939987 [24810] I am very sorry for. They seem to have given him one very bad beating. One
939987 [24811] day he flew at them all as they were coming out of school. I stood a few
939987 [24812] yards off, looking on. And, I swear, I donâ€™t remember that I laughed; it
939987 [24813] was quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him, in another minute I
939987 [24814] would have run up to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I donâ€™t
939987 [24815] know what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and
939987 [24816] struck at my thigh, here in my right leg. I didnâ€™t move. I donâ€™t mind
939987 [24817] owning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him
939987 [24818] contemptuously, as though to say, â€˜This is how you repay all my kindness!
939987 [24819] Do it again, if you like, Iâ€™m at your service.â€™ But he didnâ€™t stab me
939987 [24820] again; he broke down, he was frightened at what he had done, he threw away
939987 [24821] the knife, burst out crying, and ran away. I did not sneak on him, of
939987 [24822] course, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldnâ€™t come to the ears
939987 [24823] of the masters. I didnâ€™t even tell my mother till it had healed up. And
939987 [24824] the wound was a mere scratch. And then I heard that the same day heâ€™d been
939987 [24825] throwing stones and had bitten your fingerâ€”but you understand now what a
939987 [24826] state he was in! Well, it canâ€™t be helped: it was stupid of me not to come
939987 [24827] and forgive himâ€”that is, to make it up with himâ€”when he was taken ill. I
939987 [24828] am sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now Iâ€™ve told you all
939987 [24829] about it ... but Iâ€™m afraid it was stupid of me.â€
939987 [24830] 
939987 [24831] â€œOh, what a pity,â€ exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, â€œthat I didnâ€™t know
939987 [24832] before what terms you were on with him, or Iâ€™d have come to you long ago
939987 [24833] to beg you to go to him with me. Would you believe it, when he was
939987 [24834] feverish he talked about you in delirium. I didnâ€™t know how much you were
939987 [24835] to him! And youâ€™ve really not succeeded in finding that dog? His father
939987 [24836] and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it. Would you believe
939987 [24837] it, since heâ€™s been ill, Iâ€™ve three times heard him repeat with tears,
939987 [24838] â€˜Itâ€™s because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God is
939987 [24839] punishing me for it.â€™ He canâ€™t get that idea out of his head. And if the
939987 [24840] dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy the joy
939987 [24841] would cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.â€
939987 [24842] 
939987 [24843] â€œTell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him?â€ Kolya
939987 [24844] asked, with great curiosity. â€œWhy did you reckon on me rather than any one
939987 [24845] else?â€
939987 [24846] 
939987 [24847] â€œThere was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you would
939987 [24848] bring it when youâ€™d found it. Smurov said something of the sort. Weâ€™ve all
939987 [24849] been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that itâ€™s been seen.
939987 [24850] The boys brought him a live hare; he just looked at it, with a faint
939987 [24851] smile, and asked them to set it free in the fields. And so we did. His
939987 [24852] father has just this moment come back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hoping
939987 [24853] to comfort him with that; but I think it only makes it worse.â€
939987 [24854] 
939987 [24855] â€œTell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him, but what
939987 [24856] do you make of himâ€”a mountebank, a buffoon?â€
939987 [24857] 
939987 [24858] â€œOh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed.
939987 [24859] Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom they
939987 [24860] darenâ€™t speak the truth, from having been for years humiliated and
939987 [24861] intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery is
939987 [24862] sometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is centered in Ilusha,
939987 [24863] and if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with grief or kill himself. I
939987 [24864] feel almost certain of that when I look at him now.â€
939987 [24865] 
939987 [24866] â€œI understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,â€ Kolya
939987 [24867] added, with feeling.
939987 [24868] 
939987 [24869] â€œAnd as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you were
939987 [24870] bringing.â€
939987 [24871] 
939987 [24872] â€œWait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is
939987 [24873] Perezvon. Iâ€™ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more
939987 [24874] than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in a
939987 [24875] minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!â€ Kolya cried suddenly. â€œYouâ€™ve
939987 [24876] no overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we
939987 [24877] are all egoists, Karamazov!â€
939987 [24878] 
939987 [24879] â€œDonâ€™t trouble; it is cold, but I donâ€™t often catch cold. Let us go in,
939987 [24880] though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called Kolya,
939987 [24881] but what else?â€
939987 [24882] 
939987 [24883] â€œNikolayâ€”Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in official
939987 [24884] documents, â€˜Krassotkin son.â€™ â€ Kolya laughed for some reason, but added
939987 [24885] suddenly, â€œOf course I hate my name Nikolay.â€
939987 [24886] 
939987 [24887] â€œWhy so?â€
939987 [24888] 
939987 [24889] â€œItâ€™s so trivial, so ordinary.â€
939987 [24890] 
939987 [24891] â€œYou are thirteen?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [24892] 
939987 [24893] â€œNo, fourteenâ€”that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight. Iâ€™ll
939987 [24894] confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since itâ€™s our first
939987 [24895] meeting, so that you may understand my character at once. I hate being
939987 [24896] asked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... thereâ€™s a libelous story
939987 [24897] going about me, that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys.
939987 [24898] Itâ€™s a fact that I did play with them, but itâ€™s a perfect libel to say I
939987 [24899] did it for my own amusement. I have reasons for believing that youâ€™ve
939987 [24900] heard the story; but I wasnâ€™t playing for my own amusement, it was for the
939987 [24901] sake of the children, because they couldnâ€™t think of anything to do by
939987 [24902] themselves. But theyâ€™ve always got some silly tale. This is an awful town
939987 [24903] for gossip, I can tell you.â€
939987 [24904] 
939987 [24905] â€œBut what if you had been playing for your own amusement, whatâ€™s the
939987 [24906] harm?â€
939987 [24907] 
939987 [24908] â€œCome, I say, for my own amusement! You donâ€™t play horses, do you?â€
939987 [24909] 
939987 [24910] â€œBut you must look at it like this,â€ said Alyosha, smiling. â€œGrown-up
939987 [24911] people go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes
939987 [24912] are representedâ€”sometimes there are robbers and battles, tooâ€”and isnâ€™t
939987 [24913] that just the same thing, in a different form, of course? And young
939987 [24914] peopleâ€™s games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in
939987 [24915] its first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic instincts
939987 [24916] of the young. And sometimes these games are much better than performances
939987 [24917] in the theater, the only difference is that people go there to look at the
939987 [24918] actors, while in these games the young people are the actors themselves.
939987 [24919] But thatâ€™s only natural.â€
939987 [24920] 
939987 [24921] â€œYou think so? Is that your idea?â€ Kolya looked at him intently. â€œOh, you
939987 [24922] know, thatâ€™s rather an interesting view. When I go home, Iâ€™ll think it
939987 [24923] over. Iâ€™ll admit I thought I might learn something from you. Iâ€™ve come to
939987 [24924] learn of you, Karamazov,â€ Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneous
939987 [24925] feeling.
939987 [24926] 
939987 [24927] â€œAnd I of you,â€ said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.
939987 [24928] 
939987 [24929] Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that he
939987 [24930] treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he
939987 [24931] were â€œquite grown up.â€
939987 [24932] 
939987 [24933] â€œIâ€™ll show you something directly, Karamazov; itâ€™s a theatrical
939987 [24934] performance, too,â€ he said, laughing nervously. â€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve come.â€
939987 [24935] 
939987 [24936] â€œLet us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys
939987 [24937] leave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.â€
939987 [24938] 
939987 [24939] â€œOh, Iâ€™m only coming in for a minute. Iâ€™ll keep on my overcoat. Perezvon
939987 [24940] will stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon, lie down and
939987 [24941] be dead! You see how heâ€™s dead. Iâ€™ll go in first and explore, then Iâ€™ll
939987 [24942] whistle to him when I think fit, and youâ€™ll see, heâ€™ll dash in like mad.
939987 [24943] Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment. Iâ€™ll arrange
939987 [24944] it all and youâ€™ll see something.â€
939987 [24945] 
939987 [24946] 
939987 [24947] 
939987 [24948] Chapter V. By Ilushaâ€™s Bedside
939987 [24949] 
939987 [24950] 
939987 [24951] The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is
939987 [24952] already familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment
939987 [24953] with a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and
939987 [24954] though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha
939987 [24955] who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the
939987 [24956] fact. All the art he had used had been to take them, one by one, to
939987 [24957] Ilusha, without â€œsheepish sentimentality,â€ appearing to do so casually and
939987 [24958] without design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. He
939987 [24959] was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy
939987 [24960] shown him by these boys, who had been his enemies. Krassotkin was the only
939987 [24961] one missing and his absence was a heavy load on Ilushaâ€™s heart. Perhaps
939987 [24962] the bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing Krassotkin, who
939987 [24963] had been his one friend and protector. Clever little Smurov, who was the
939987 [24964] first to make it up with Ilusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted
939987 [24965] to Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something, the
939987 [24966] latter cut him short, bidding Smurov tell â€œKaramazovâ€ at once that he knew
939987 [24967] best what to do, that he wanted no oneâ€™s advice, and that, if he went to
939987 [24968] see Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he had â€œhis own reasons.â€
939987 [24969] 
939987 [24970] That was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha had not been
939987 [24971] to see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited, he sent Smurov to
939987 [24972] him twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt, impatient
939987 [24973] refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any more, that if he
939987 [24974] came himself, he, Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha at all. Up to the
939987 [24975] very last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that
939987 [24976] morning, and only the evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolya
939987 [24977] abruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning, for he would go
939987 [24978] with him to the Snegiryovsâ€™, but warned him on no account to say he was
939987 [24979] coming, as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurovâ€™s fancy
939987 [24980] that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya had
939987 [24981] dropped that â€œthey must be asses not to find the dog, if it was alive.â€
939987 [24982] When Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly hinted at his guess about
939987 [24983] the dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent rage. â€œIâ€™m not such an ass as to
939987 [24984] go hunting about the town for other peopleâ€™s dogs when Iâ€™ve got a dog of
939987 [24985] my own! And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a
939987 [24986] pin? Sheepish sentimentality, thatâ€™s what it is!â€
939987 [24987] 
939987 [24988] For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikons
939987 [24989] in the corner. He had not been to school since the day he met Alyosha and
939987 [24990] bit his finger. He was taken ill the same day, though for a month
939987 [24991] afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and
939987 [24992] passage. But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without
939987 [24993] help from his father. His father was terribly concerned about him. He even
939987 [24994] gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die.
939987 [24995] And often, especially after leading him round the room on his arm and
939987 [24996] putting him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the passage and,
939987 [24997] leaning his head against the wall, he would break into paroxysms of
939987 [24998] violent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha.
939987 [24999] 
939987 [25000] Returning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to amuse and
939987 [25001] comfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories, funny anecdotes, or
939987 [25002] would mimic comic people he had happened to meet, even imitate the howls
939987 [25003] and cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear to see his father fooling
939987 [25004] and playing the buffoon. Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked
939987 [25005] it, he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt,
939987 [25006] and he was continually haunted by the memory of the â€œwisp of towâ€ and that
939987 [25007] â€œterrible day.â€
939987 [25008] 
939987 [25009] Nina, Ilushaâ€™s gentle, crippled sister, did not like her fatherâ€™s
939987 [25010] buffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg
939987 [25011] to study at the university). But the half-imbecile mother was greatly
939987 [25012] diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or
939987 [25013] performing something. It was the only way she could be amused; all the
939987 [25014] rest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now every one had
939987 [25015] forgotten her, that no one treated her with respect, that she was
939987 [25016] slighted, and so on. But during the last few days she had completely
939987 [25017] changed. She began looking constantly at Ilushaâ€™s bed in the corner and
939987 [25018] seemed lost in thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried,
939987 [25019] she cried quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change in
939987 [25020] her with mournful perplexity. The boysâ€™ visits at first only angered her,
939987 [25021] but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her, and at
939987 [25022] last she liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming, she
939987 [25023] would have felt dreary without them. When the children told some story or
939987 [25024] played a game, she laughed and clapped her hands. She called some of them
939987 [25025] to her and kissed them. She was particularly fond of Smurov.
939987 [25026] 
939987 [25027] As for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who came to
939987 [25028] cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy. He
939987 [25029] even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression, and that that
939987 [25030] would hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about Ilusha, he had not,
939987 [25031] till lately, felt one minuteâ€™s doubt of his boyâ€™s ultimate recovery.
939987 [25032] 
939987 [25033] He met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot; he
939987 [25034] was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back,
939987 [25035] but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up. He began buying
939987 [25036] little things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and cut them
939987 [25037] sandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money. He
939987 [25038] had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha
939987 [25039] had predicted he would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more
939987 [25040] about their circumstances and Ilushaâ€™s illness, visited them herself, made
939987 [25041] the acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the
939987 [25042] half-imbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping them, and
939987 [25043] the captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying,
939987 [25044] forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance.
939987 [25045] 
939987 [25046] All this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [25047] came punctually every other day, but little was gained by his visits and
939987 [25048] he dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday morning a new doctor
939987 [25049] was expected, who had come from Moscow, where he had a great reputation.
939987 [25050] Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense, not
939987 [25051] expressly for Ilusha, but for another object of which more will be said in
939987 [25052] its place hereafter. But, as he had come, she had asked him to see Ilusha
939987 [25053] as well, and the captain had been told to expect him. He hadnâ€™t the
939987 [25054] slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wished
939987 [25055] for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.
939987 [25056] 
939987 [25057] At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room, the
939987 [25058] captain and all the boys were round Ilushaâ€™s bed, looking at a tiny
939987 [25059] mastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the captain
939987 [25060] had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was still
939987 [25061] fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard
939987 [25062] three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy, not an
939987 [25063] ordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff (a very important point, of
939987 [25064] course), tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased.
939987 [25065] But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only
939987 [25066] served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had
939987 [25067] killed. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling sadly,
939987 [25068] stroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked the puppy,
939987 [25069] but ... it wasnâ€™t Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy,
939987 [25070] too, then he would have been completely happy.
939987 [25071] 
939987 [25072] â€œKrassotkin!â€ cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first to see him
939987 [25073] come in.
939987 [25074] 
939987 [25075] Krassotkinâ€™s entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away and
939987 [25076] stood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full view of Ilusha.
939987 [25077] The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.
939987 [25078] 
939987 [25079] â€œPlease come in ... you are welcome!â€ he said hurriedly. â€œIlusha, Mr.
939987 [25080] Krassotkin has come to see you!â€
939987 [25081] 
939987 [25082] But Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly showed his
939987 [25083] complete knowledge of the manners of good society. He turned first to the
939987 [25084] captainâ€™s wife sitting in her arm-chair, who was very ill-humored at the
939987 [25085] moment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilushaâ€™s bed
939987 [25086] and did not let her see the new puppy. With the greatest courtesy he made
939987 [25087] her a bow, scraping his foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as the
939987 [25088] only other lady present, a similar bow. This polite behavior made an
939987 [25089] extremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.
939987 [25090] 
939987 [25091] â€œThere, you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought
939987 [25092] up,â€ she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; â€œbut as for our other
939987 [25093] visitors they come in one on the top of another.â€
939987 [25094] 
939987 [25095] â€œHow do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that?â€ muttered
939987 [25096] the captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her account.
939987 [25097] 
939987 [25098] â€œThatâ€™s how they ride in. They get on each otherâ€™s shoulders in the
939987 [25099] passage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange sort of
939987 [25100] visitors!â€
939987 [25101] 
939987 [25102] â€œBut whoâ€™s come in like that, mamma?â€
939987 [25103] 
939987 [25104] â€œWhy, that boy came in riding on that oneâ€™s back and this one on that
939987 [25105] oneâ€™s.â€
939987 [25106] 
939987 [25107] Kolya was already by Ilushaâ€™s bedside. The sick boy turned visibly paler.
939987 [25108] He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya. Kolya had not
939987 [25109] seen his little friend for two months, and he was overwhelmed at the sight
939987 [25110] of him. He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted, yellow
939987 [25111] face, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands.
939987 [25112] He saw, with grieved surprise, Ilushaâ€™s rapid, hard breathing and dry
939987 [25113] lips. He stepped close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed,
939987 [25114] he said:
939987 [25115] 
939987 [25116] â€œWell, old man ... how are you?â€ But his voice failed him, he couldnâ€™t
939987 [25117] achieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched and the corners
939987 [25118] of his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile, still unable
939987 [25119] to utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it over
939987 [25120] Ilushaâ€™s hair.
939987 [25121] 
939987 [25122] â€œNever mind!â€ he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or perhaps not
939987 [25123] knowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent again.
939987 [25124] 
939987 [25125] â€œHallo, so youâ€™ve got a new puppy?â€ Kolya said suddenly, in a most callous
939987 [25126] voice.
939987 [25127] 
939987 [25128] â€œYeâ€”es,â€ answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.
939987 [25129] 
939987 [25130] â€œA black nose, that means heâ€™ll be fierce, a good house-dog,â€ Kolya
939987 [25131] observed gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared about was the
939987 [25132] puppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had to do his utmost to
939987 [25133] control his feelings not to burst out crying like a child, and do what he
939987 [25134] would he could not control it. â€œWhen it grows up, youâ€™ll have to keep it
939987 [25135] on the chain, Iâ€™m sure.â€
939987 [25136] 
939987 [25137] â€œHeâ€™ll be a huge dog!â€ cried one of the boys.
939987 [25138] 
939987 [25139] â€œOf course he will,â€ â€œa mastiff,â€ â€œlarge,â€ â€œlike this,â€ â€œas big as a
939987 [25140] calf,â€ shouted several voices.
939987 [25141] 
939987 [25142] â€œAs big as a calf, as a real calf,â€ chimed in the captain. â€œI got one like
939987 [25143] that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents are huge and
939987 [25144] very fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor.... Sit down here,
939987 [25145] on Ilushaâ€™s bed, or here on the bench. You are welcome, weâ€™ve been hoping
939987 [25146] to see you a long time.... You were so kind as to come with Alexey
939987 [25147] Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [25148] 
939987 [25149] Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilushaâ€™s feet. Though he had
939987 [25150] perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way,
939987 [25151] now he completely lost the thread of it.
939987 [25152] 
939987 [25153] â€œNo ... I came with Perezvon. Iâ€™ve got a dog now, called Perezvon. A
939987 [25154] Slavonic name. Heâ€™s out there ... if I whistle, heâ€™ll run in. Iâ€™ve brought
939987 [25155] a dog, too,â€ he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. â€œDo you remember
939987 [25156] Zhutchka, old man?â€ he suddenly fired the question at him.
939987 [25157] 
939987 [25158] Ilushaâ€™s little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression at
939987 [25159] Kolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not to
939987 [25160] speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.
939987 [25161] 
939987 [25162] â€œWhere ... is Zhutchka?â€ Ilusha asked in a broken voice.
939987 [25163] 
939987 [25164] â€œOh, well, my boy, your Zhutchkaâ€™s lost and done for!â€
939987 [25165] 
939987 [25166] Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya.
939987 [25167] Alyosha, catching Kolyaâ€™s eye, signed to him vigorously again, but he
939987 [25168] turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.
939987 [25169] 
939987 [25170] â€œIt must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a meal
939987 [25171] like that,â€ Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a little
939987 [25172] breathless. â€œBut Iâ€™ve got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... Iâ€™ve
939987 [25173] brought him to show you.â€
939987 [25174] 
939987 [25175] â€œI donâ€™t want him!â€ said Ilusha suddenly.
939987 [25176] 
939987 [25177] â€œNo, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him on
939987 [25178] purpose.... Heâ€™s the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to call in
939987 [25179] my dog, madam?â€ He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable
939987 [25180] excitement in his manner.
939987 [25181] 
939987 [25182] â€œI donâ€™t want him, I donâ€™t want him!â€ cried Ilusha, with a mournful break
939987 [25183] in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes.
939987 [25184] 
939987 [25185] â€œYouâ€™d better,â€ the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which
939987 [25186] he had just sat down, â€œyouâ€™d better ... another time,â€ he muttered, but
939987 [25187] Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to Smurov, â€œOpen the
939987 [25188] door,â€ and as soon as it was open, he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed
939987 [25189] headlong into the room.
939987 [25190] 
939987 [25191] â€œJump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!â€ shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stood
939987 [25192] erect on its hind-legs by Ilushaâ€™s bedside. What followed was a surprise
939987 [25193] to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent over
939987 [25194] Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.
939987 [25195] 
939987 [25196] â€œItâ€™s ... Zhutchka!â€ he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy and
939987 [25197] suffering.
939987 [25198] 
939987 [25199] â€œAnd who did you think it was?â€ Krassotkin shouted with all his might, in
939987 [25200] a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him
939987 [25201] up to Ilusha.
939987 [25202] 
939987 [25203] â€œLook, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn, just
939987 [25204] the marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I found him
939987 [25205] directly. He did not belong to any one!â€ he explained, turning quickly to
939987 [25206] the captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha. â€œHe used to
939987 [25207] live in the Fedotovsâ€™ back-yard. Though he made his home there, they did
939987 [25208] not feed him. He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I
939987 [25209] found him.... You see, old man, he couldnâ€™t have swallowed what you gave
939987 [25210] him. If he had, he must have died, he must have! So he must have spat it
939987 [25211] out, since he is alive. You did not see him do it. But the pin pricked his
939987 [25212] tongue, that is why he squealed. He ran away squealing and you thought
939987 [25213] heâ€™d swallowed it. He might well squeal, because the skin of dogsâ€™ mouths
939987 [25214] is so tender ... tenderer than in men, much tenderer!â€ Kolya cried
939987 [25215] impetuously, his face glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could not
939987 [25216] speak. White as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his great
939987 [25217] eyes almost starting out of his head. And if Krassotkin, who had no
939987 [25218] suspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a
939987 [25219] moment might have on the sick childâ€™s health, nothing would have induced
939987 [25220] him to play such a trick on him. But Alyosha was perhaps the only person
939987 [25221] in the room who realized it. As for the captain he behaved like a small
939987 [25222] child.
939987 [25223] 
939987 [25224] â€œZhutchka! Itâ€™s Zhutchka!â€ he cried in a blissful voice, â€œIlusha, this is
939987 [25225] Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!â€ He was almost weeping.
939987 [25226] 
939987 [25227] â€œAnd I never guessed!â€ cried Smurov regretfully. â€œBravo, Krassotkin! I
939987 [25228] said heâ€™d find the dog and here heâ€™s found him.â€
939987 [25229] 
939987 [25230] â€œHere heâ€™s found him!â€ another boy repeated gleefully.
939987 [25231] 
939987 [25232] â€œKrassotkinâ€™s a brick!â€ cried a third voice.
939987 [25233] 
939987 [25234] â€œHeâ€™s a brick, heâ€™s a brick!â€ cried the other boys, and they began
939987 [25235] clapping.
939987 [25236] 
939987 [25237] â€œWait, wait,â€ Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. â€œIâ€™ll
939987 [25238] tell you how it happened, thatâ€™s the whole point. I found him, I took him
939987 [25239] home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not show
939987 [25240] him to any one till to-day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight,
939987 [25241] but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess. And
939987 [25242] meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all
939987 [25243] the things he can do! I trained him so as to bring you a well-trained dog,
939987 [25244] in good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, â€˜See, old man,
939987 [25245] what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!â€™ Havenâ€™t you a bit of meat? Heâ€™ll
939987 [25246] show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat,
939987 [25247] havenâ€™t you got any?â€
939987 [25248] 
939987 [25249] The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking
939987 [25250] was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted to
939987 [25251] Perezvon, â€œDead!â€ And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back
939987 [25252] with its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with the
939987 [25253] same suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dogâ€™s
939987 [25254] performance was â€œmamma.â€ She laughed at the dog and began snapping her
939987 [25255] fingers and calling it, â€œPerezvon, Perezvon!â€
939987 [25256] 
939987 [25257] â€œNothing will make him get up, nothing!â€ Kolya cried triumphantly, proud
939987 [25258] of his success. â€œHe wonâ€™t move for all the shouting in the world, but if I
939987 [25259] call to him, heâ€™ll jump up in a minute. Ici, Perezvon!â€ The dog leapt up
939987 [25260] and bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran back with a piece
939987 [25261] of cooked beef.
939987 [25262] 
939987 [25263] â€œIs it hot?â€ Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air, taking
939987 [25264] the meat. â€œDogs donâ€™t like hot things. No, itâ€™s all right. Look,
939987 [25265] everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why arenâ€™t you looking? He does
939987 [25266] not look at him, now Iâ€™ve brought him.â€
939987 [25267] 
939987 [25268] The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose
939987 [25269] out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The luckless
939987 [25270] dog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as long as his
939987 [25271] master chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for half an hour.
939987 [25272] But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.
939987 [25273] 
939987 [25274] â€œPaid for!â€ cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dogâ€™s
939987 [25275] nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and
939987 [25276] surprise.
939987 [25277] 
939987 [25278] â€œCan you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the
939987 [25279] dog?â€ exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his
939987 [25280] voice.
939987 [25281] 
939987 [25282] â€œSimply for that!â€ answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. â€œI wanted to
939987 [25283] show him in all his glory.â€
939987 [25284] 
939987 [25285] â€œPerezvon! Perezvon,â€ called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingers
939987 [25286] and beckoning to the dog.
939987 [25287] 
939987 [25288] â€œWhat is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!â€ Kolya slapped
939987 [25289] the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both arms round
939987 [25290] his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek. Ilusha crept close to
939987 [25291] him, stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dogâ€™s shaggy
939987 [25292] coat.
939987 [25293] 
939987 [25294] â€œDear, dear!â€ kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again on the
939987 [25295] edge of the bed.
939987 [25296] 
939987 [25297] â€œIlusha, I can show you another trick. Iâ€™ve brought you a little cannon.
939987 [25298] You remember, I told you about it before and you said how much youâ€™d like
939987 [25299] to see it. Well, here, Iâ€™ve brought it to you.â€
939987 [25300] 
939987 [25301] And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon. He
939987 [25302] hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have waited
939987 [25303] till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he hurried on
939987 [25304] regardless of all consideration. â€œYou are all happy now,â€ he felt, â€œso
939987 [25305] hereâ€™s something to make you happier!â€ He was perfectly enchanted himself.
939987 [25306] 
939987 [25307] â€œIâ€™ve been coveting this thing for a long while; itâ€™s for you, old man,
939987 [25308] itâ€™s for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he had it from
939987 [25309] his brother. I swopped a book from fatherâ€™s book-case for it, _A Kinsman
939987 [25310] of Mahomet or Salutary Folly_, a scandalous book published in Moscow a
939987 [25311] hundred years ago, before they had any censorship. And Morozov has a taste
939987 [25312] for such things. He was grateful to me, too....â€
939987 [25313] 
939987 [25314] Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it.
939987 [25315] Ilusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round the dog, he
939987 [25316] gazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even greater when Kolya
939987 [25317] announced that he had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off at
939987 [25318] once â€œif it wonâ€™t alarm the ladies.â€ â€œMammaâ€ immediately asked to look at
939987 [25319] the toy closer and her request was granted. She was much pleased with the
939987 [25320] little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap.
939987 [25321] She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea
939987 [25322] of what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot. The
939987 [25323] captain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minute
939987 [25324] quantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be put off till another
939987 [25325] time. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an empty part of the
939987 [25326] room, three grains of powder were thrust into the touch-hole and a match
939987 [25327] was put to it. A magnificent explosion followed. Mamma was startled, but
939987 [25328] at once laughed with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. But
939987 [25329] the captain, looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them. Kolya
939987 [25330] picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together with
939987 [25331] the powder and the shot.
939987 [25332] 
939987 [25333] â€œI got it for you, for you! Iâ€™ve been keeping it for you a long time,â€ he
939987 [25334] repeated once more in his delight.
939987 [25335] 
939987 [25336] â€œOh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!â€ mamma began begging like a
939987 [25337] little child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it.
939987 [25338] Kolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily.
939987 [25339] 
939987 [25340] â€œMamma, mamma,â€ he ran to her, â€œthe cannonâ€™s yours, of course, but let
939987 [25341] Ilusha have it, because itâ€™s a present to him, but itâ€™s just as good as
939987 [25342] yours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both of
939987 [25343] you, both of you.â€
939987 [25344] 
939987 [25345] â€œNo, I donâ€™t want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine
939987 [25346] altogether, not Ilushaâ€™s,â€ persisted mamma, on the point of tears.
939987 [25347] 
939987 [25348] â€œTake it, mother, here, keep it!â€ Ilusha cried. â€œKrassotkin, may I give it
939987 [25349] to my mother?â€ he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as though
939987 [25350] he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to some one
939987 [25351] else.
939987 [25352] 
939987 [25353] â€œOf course you may,â€ Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the cannon
939987 [25354] from Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow. She was so
939987 [25355] touched that she cried.
939987 [25356] 
939987 [25357] â€œIlusha, darling, heâ€™s the one who loves his mamma!â€ she said tenderly,
939987 [25358] and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again.
939987 [25359] 
939987 [25360] â€œMamma, let me kiss your hand.â€ The captain darted up to her at once and
939987 [25361] did so.
939987 [25362] 
939987 [25363] â€œAnd I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,â€ said the
939987 [25364] grateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.
939987 [25365] 
939987 [25366] â€œAnd Iâ€™ll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the powder
939987 [25367] ourselves now. Borovikov found out how itâ€™s madeâ€”twenty-four parts of
939987 [25368] saltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal. Itâ€™s all pounded
939987 [25369] together, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy
939987 [25370] sieveâ€”thatâ€™s how itâ€™s done.â€
939987 [25371] 
939987 [25372] â€œSmurov told me about your powder, only father says itâ€™s not real
939987 [25373] gunpowder,â€ responded Ilusha.
939987 [25374] 
939987 [25375] â€œNot real?â€ Kolya flushed. â€œIt burns. I donâ€™t know, of course.â€
939987 [25376] 
939987 [25377] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t mean that,â€ put in the captain with a guilty face. â€œI only
939987 [25378] said that real powder is not made like that, but thatâ€™s nothing, it can be
939987 [25379] made so.â€
939987 [25380] 
939987 [25381] â€œI donâ€™t know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it burned
939987 [25382] splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash. But that was only
939987 [25383] the paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best, I
939987 [25384] donâ€™t know.... And Bulkinâ€™s father thrashed him on account of our powder,
939987 [25385] did you hear?â€ he turned to Ilusha.
939987 [25386] 
939987 [25387] â€œYes,â€ answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense interest and
939987 [25388] enjoyment.
939987 [25389] 
939987 [25390] â€œWe had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his
939987 [25391] bed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and thrashed him on the
939987 [25392] spot. He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters. He is
939987 [25393] not allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go about with me
939987 [25394] now. Smurov is not allowed to either, Iâ€™ve got a bad name with every one.
939987 [25395] They say Iâ€™m a â€˜desperate character,â€™ â€ Kolya smiled scornfully. â€œIt all
939987 [25396] began from what happened on the railway.â€
939987 [25397] 
939987 [25398] â€œAh, weâ€™ve heard of that exploit of yours, too,â€ cried the captain. â€œHow
939987 [25399] could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you werenâ€™t the least
939987 [25400] afraid, lying there under the train? Werenâ€™t you frightened?â€
939987 [25401] 
939987 [25402] The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.
939987 [25403] 
939987 [25404] â€œNâ€”not particularly,â€ answered Kolya carelessly. â€œWhatâ€™s blasted my
939987 [25405] reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,â€ he said,
939987 [25406] turning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an unconcerned air as he
939987 [25407] talked, he still could not control himself and was continually missing the
939987 [25408] note he tried to keep up.
939987 [25409] 
939987 [25410] â€œAh! I heard about the goose!â€ Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. â€œThey
939987 [25411] told me, but I didnâ€™t understand. Did they really take you to the court?â€
939987 [25412] 
939987 [25413] â€œThe most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill as
939987 [25414] they always do,â€ Kolya began carelessly. â€œI was walking through the
939987 [25415] market-place here one day, just when theyâ€™d driven in the geese. I stopped
939987 [25416] and looked at them. All at once a fellow, who is an errand-boy at
939987 [25417] Plotnikovâ€™s now, looked at me and said, â€˜What are you looking at the geese
939987 [25418] for?â€™ I looked at him; he was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am
939987 [25419] always on the side of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to the
939987 [25420] peasants.... Weâ€™ve dropped behind the peasantsâ€”thatâ€™s an axiom. I believe
939987 [25421] you are laughing, Karamazov?â€
939987 [25422] 
939987 [25423] â€œNo, Heaven forbid, I am listening,â€ said Alyosha with a most good-natured
939987 [25424] air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.
939987 [25425] 
939987 [25426] â€œMy theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,â€ he hurried on again, looking
939987 [25427] pleased. â€œI believe in the people and am always glad to give them their
939987 [25428] due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a _sine qua non_ ... But I
939987 [25429] was telling you about the goose. So I turned to the fool and answered, â€˜I
939987 [25430] am wondering what the goose thinks about.â€™ He looked at me quite stupidly,
939987 [25431] â€˜And what does the goose think about?â€™ he asked. â€˜Do you see that cart
939987 [25432] full of oats?â€™ I said. â€˜The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the
939987 [25433] goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them upâ€”do you
939987 [25434] see?â€™ â€˜I see that quite well,â€™ he said. â€˜Well,â€™ said I, â€˜if that cart were
939987 [25435] to move on a little, would it break the gooseâ€™s neck or not?â€™ â€˜Itâ€™d be
939987 [25436] sure to break it,â€™ and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted.
939987 [25437] â€˜Come on, then,â€™ said I, â€˜letâ€™s try.â€™ â€˜Letâ€™s,â€™ he said. And it did not
939987 [25438] take us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed, and
939987 [25439] I stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasnâ€™t looking, he
939987 [25440] was talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its head
939987 [25441] in after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I
939987 [25442] winked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The gooseâ€™s neck
939987 [25443] was broken in half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at
939987 [25444] that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. â€˜You did that on
939987 [25445] purpose!â€™ â€˜No, not on purpose.â€™ â€˜Yes, you did, on purpose!â€™ Well, they
939987 [25446] shouted, â€˜Take him to the justice of the peace!â€™ They took me, too. â€˜You
939987 [25447] were there, too,â€™ they said, â€˜you helped, youâ€™re known all over the
939987 [25448] market!â€™ And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,â€
939987 [25449] Kolya added conceitedly. â€œWe all went off to the justiceâ€™s, they brought
939987 [25450] the goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubbering
939987 [25451] like a woman. And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number
939987 [25452] of geese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses. The justice of
939987 [25453] the peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a rouble
939987 [25454] for the goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was warned not to
939987 [25455] play such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. â€˜It
939987 [25456] wasnâ€™t me,â€™ he said, â€˜it was he egged me on,â€™ and he pointed to me. I
939987 [25457] answered with the utmost composure that I hadnâ€™t egged him on, that I
939987 [25458] simply stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically. The
939987 [25459] justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for having
939987 [25460] smiled. â€˜Iâ€™ll complain to your masters of you, so that for the future you
939987 [25461] maynâ€™t waste your time on such general propositions, instead of sitting at
939987 [25462] your books and learning your lessons.â€™ He didnâ€™t complain to the masters,
939987 [25463] that was a joke, but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears of
939987 [25464] the masters. Their ears are long, you know! The classical master,
939987 [25465] Kolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off
939987 [25466] again. But Kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass. Did
939987 [25467] you know, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles,
939987 [25468] and his brideâ€™s a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.
939987 [25469] The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it:
939987 [25470] 
939987 [25471] 
939987 [25472]     Astounding news has reached the class,
939987 [25473]     Kolbasnikov has been an ass.
939987 [25474] 
939987 [25475] 
939987 [25476] And so on, awfully funny, Iâ€™ll bring it to you later on. I say nothing
939987 [25477] against Dardanelov, he is a learned man, thereâ€™s no doubt about it. I
939987 [25478] respect men like that and itâ€™s not because he stood up for me.â€
939987 [25479] 
939987 [25480] â€œBut you took him down about the founders of Troy!â€ Smurov put in
939987 [25481] suddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He was
939987 [25482] particularly pleased with the story of the goose.
939987 [25483] 
939987 [25484] â€œDid you really take him down?â€ the captain inquired, in a flattering way.
939987 [25485] â€œOn the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me about it
939987 [25486] at the time.â€
939987 [25487] 
939987 [25488] â€œHe knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!â€ put in
939987 [25489] Ilusha; â€œhe only pretends to be like that, but really he is top in every
939987 [25490] subject....â€
939987 [25491] 
939987 [25492] Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.
939987 [25493] 
939987 [25494] â€œOh, thatâ€™s all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this an
939987 [25495] unimportant question,â€ said Kolya with haughty humility. He had by now
939987 [25496] completely recovered his dignity, though he was still a little uneasy. He
939987 [25497] felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose,
939987 [25498] for instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious
939987 [25499] and had not said a word all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees to
939987 [25500] have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, and
939987 [25501] thought he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything like
939987 [25502] that Kolya wouldâ€”
939987 [25503] 
939987 [25504] â€œI regard the question as quite a trivial one,â€ he rapped out again,
939987 [25505] proudly.
939987 [25506] 
939987 [25507] â€œAnd I know who founded Troy,â€ a boy, who had not spoken before, said
939987 [25508] suddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent and seemed to be
939987 [25509] shy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He was sitting
939987 [25510] near the door. Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.
939987 [25511] 
939987 [25512] The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret
939987 [25513] for the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by reading
939987 [25514] Smaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when Kolyaâ€™s back
939987 [25515] was turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolyaâ€™s
939987 [25516] books, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation
939987 [25517] of Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could not bring
939987 [25518] himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy, afraid
939987 [25519] of what might happen and of Krassotkinâ€™s somehow putting him to shame over
939987 [25520] it. But now he couldnâ€™t resist saying it. For weeks he had been longing
939987 [25521] to.
939987 [25522] 
939987 [25523] â€œWell, who did found it?â€ asked Kolya, turning to him with haughty
939987 [25524] superciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and at once
939987 [25525] made up his mind how to take it. There was, so to speak, a discordant note
939987 [25526] in the general harmony.
939987 [25527] 
939987 [25528] â€œTroy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,â€ the boy rapped out
939987 [25529] at once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so, that it was
939987 [25530] painful to look at him. But the boys stared at him, stared at him for a
939987 [25531] whole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were
939987 [25532] fastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy with
939987 [25533] disdainful composure.
939987 [25534] 
939987 [25535] â€œIn what sense did they found it?â€ he deigned to comment at last. â€œAnd
939987 [25536] what is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do? Did they go
939987 [25537] and each lay a brick, do you suppose?â€
939987 [25538] 
939987 [25539] There was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson. He was
939987 [25540] silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so for a minute.
939987 [25541] 
939987 [25542] â€œBefore you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a
939987 [25543] nationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,â€ he admonished
939987 [25544] him in stern, incisive tones. â€œBut I attach no consequence to these old
939987 [25545] wivesâ€™ tales and I donâ€™t think much of universal history in general,â€ he
939987 [25546] added carelessly, addressing the company generally.
939987 [25547] 
939987 [25548] â€œUniversal history?â€ the captain inquired, looking almost scared.
939987 [25549] 
939987 [25550] â€œYes, universal history! Itâ€™s the study of the successive follies of
939987 [25551] mankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are mathematics and
939987 [25552] natural science,â€ said Kolya. He was showing off and he stole a glance at
939987 [25553] Alyosha; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there. But Alyosha was
939987 [25554] still silent and still serious as before. If Alyosha had said a word it
939987 [25555] would have stopped him, but Alyosha was silent and â€œit might be the
939987 [25556] silence of contempt,â€ and that finally irritated Kolya.
939987 [25557] 
939987 [25558] â€œThe classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing more.
939987 [25559] You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?â€
939987 [25560] 
939987 [25561] â€œI donâ€™t agree,â€ said Alyosha, with a faint smile.
939987 [25562] 
939987 [25563] â€œThe study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a police
939987 [25564] measure, thatâ€™s simply why it has been introduced into our schools.â€ By
939987 [25565] degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. â€œLatin and Greek were
939987 [25566] introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect.
939987 [25567] It was dull before, so what could they do to make things duller? It was
939987 [25568] senseless enough before, so what could they do to make it more senseless?
939987 [25569] So they thought of Greek and Latin. Thatâ€™s my opinion, I hope I shall
939987 [25570] never change it,â€ Kolya finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.
939987 [25571] 
939987 [25572] â€œThatâ€™s true,â€ assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of conviction.
939987 [25573] He had listened attentively.
939987 [25574] 
939987 [25575] â€œAnd yet he is first in Latin himself,â€ cried one of the group of boys
939987 [25576] suddenly.
939987 [25577] 
939987 [25578] â€œYes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin,â€ echoed Ilusha.
939987 [25579] 
939987 [25580] â€œWhat of it?â€ Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise was
939987 [25581] very sweet to him. â€œI am fagging away at Latin because I have to, because
939987 [25582] I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that whatever you
939987 [25583] do, itâ€™s worth doing it well. But in my soul I have a profound contempt
939987 [25584] for the classics and all that fraud.... You donâ€™t agree, Karamazov?â€
939987 [25585] 
939987 [25586] â€œWhy â€˜fraudâ€™?â€ Alyosha smiled again.
939987 [25587] 
939987 [25588] â€œWell, all the classical authors have been translated into all languages,
939987 [25589] so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin,
939987 [25590] but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the intelligence. So what can
939987 [25591] one call it but a fraud?â€
939987 [25592] 
939987 [25593] â€œWhy, who taught you all this?â€ cried Alyosha, surprised at last.
939987 [25594] 
939987 [25595] â€œIn the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being
939987 [25596] taught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics being translated
939987 [25597] our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class.â€
939987 [25598] 
939987 [25599] â€œThe doctor has come!â€ cried Nina, who had been silent till then.
939987 [25600] 
939987 [25601] A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate. The captain,
939987 [25602] who had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed headlong out to
939987 [25603] meet him. â€œMammaâ€ pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.
939987 [25604] Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight. Nina,
939987 [25605] from her invalid chair, anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. The
939987 [25606] boys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to come again in the
939987 [25607] evening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.
939987 [25608] 
939987 [25609] â€œI wonâ€™t go away, I wonâ€™t go away,â€ Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. â€œIâ€™ll
939987 [25610] wait in the passage and come back when the doctorâ€™s gone, Iâ€™ll come back
939987 [25611] with Perezvon.â€
939987 [25612] 
939987 [25613] But by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person with long,
939987 [25614] dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat. As he
939987 [25615] crossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback; he probably fancied he had
939987 [25616] come to the wrong place. â€œHow is this? Where am I?â€ he muttered, not
939987 [25617] removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of
939987 [25618] the room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. The
939987 [25619] captain, bent double, was bowing low before him.
939987 [25620] 
939987 [25621] â€œItâ€™s here, sir, here, sir,â€ he muttered cringingly; â€œitâ€™s here, youâ€™ve
939987 [25622] come right, you were coming to us...â€
939987 [25623] 
939987 [25624] â€œSne-gi-ryov?â€ the doctor said loudly and pompously. â€œMr. Snegiryovâ€”is
939987 [25625] that you?â€
939987 [25626] 
939987 [25627] â€œThatâ€™s me, sir!â€
939987 [25628] 
939987 [25629] â€œAh!â€
939987 [25630] 
939987 [25631] The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw
939987 [25632] off his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck. The
939987 [25633] captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took off his cap.
939987 [25634] 
939987 [25635] â€œWhere is the patient?â€ he asked emphatically.
939987 [25636]

939987 [25639] Chapter VI. Precocity
939987 [25640] 
939987 [25641] 
939987 [25642] â€œWhat do you think the doctor will say to him?â€ Kolya asked quickly. â€œWhat
939987 [25643] a repulsive mug, though, hasnâ€™t he? I canâ€™t endure medicine!â€
939987 [25644] 
939987 [25645] â€œIlusha is dying. I think thatâ€™s certain,â€ answered Alyosha, mournfully.
939987 [25646] 
939987 [25647] â€œThey are rogues! Medicineâ€™s a fraud! I am glad to have made your
939987 [25648] acquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time. I
939987 [25649] am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.â€
939987 [25650] 
939987 [25651] Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more
939987 [25652] demonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this, smiled, and
939987 [25653] pressed his hand.
939987 [25654] 
939987 [25655] â€œIâ€™ve long learned to respect you as a rare person,â€ Kolya muttered again,
939987 [25656] faltering and uncertain. â€œI have heard you are a mystic and have been in
939987 [25657] the monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasnâ€™t put me off.
939987 [25658] Contact with real life will cure you.... Itâ€™s always so with characters
939987 [25659] like yours.â€
939987 [25660] 
939987 [25661] â€œWhat do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?â€ Alyosha was rather
939987 [25662] astonished.
939987 [25663] 
939987 [25664] â€œOh, God and all the rest of it.â€
939987 [25665] 
939987 [25666] â€œWhat, donâ€™t you believe in God?â€
939987 [25667] 
939987 [25668] â€œOh, Iâ€™ve nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but
939987 [25669] ... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all
939987 [25670] that ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented,â€
939987 [25671] added Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might
939987 [25672] think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was
939987 [25673] â€œgrown up.â€ â€œI havenâ€™t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to
939987 [25674] him,â€ Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly
939987 [25675] annoyed.
939987 [25676] 
939987 [25677] â€œI must confess I canâ€™t endure entering on such discussions,â€ he said with
939987 [25678] a final air. â€œItâ€™s possible for one who doesnâ€™t believe in God to love
939987 [25679] mankind, donâ€™t you think so? Voltaire didnâ€™t believe in God and loved
939987 [25680] mankind?â€ (â€œI am at it again,â€ he thought to himself.)
939987 [25681] 
939987 [25682] â€œVoltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I donâ€™t
939987 [25683] think he loved mankind very much either,â€ said Alyosha quietly, gently,
939987 [25684] and quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age,
939987 [25685] or even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyoshaâ€™s apparent
939987 [25686] diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the
939987 [25687] question for him, little Kolya, to settle.
939987 [25688] 
939987 [25689] â€œHave you read Voltaire?â€ Alyosha finished.
939987 [25690] 
939987 [25691] â€œNo, not to say read.... But Iâ€™ve read _Candide_ in the Russian
939987 [25692] translation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again!
939987 [25693] again!)â€
939987 [25694] 
939987 [25695] â€œAnd did you understand it?â€
939987 [25696] 
939987 [25697] â€œOh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldnâ€™t
939987 [25698] understand it? Thereâ€™s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I
939987 [25699] can understand that itâ€™s a philosophical novel and written to advocate an
939987 [25700] idea....â€ Kolya was getting mixed by now. â€œI am a Socialist, Karamazov, I
939987 [25701] am an incurable Socialist,â€ he announced suddenly, apropos of nothing.
939987 [25702] 
939987 [25703] â€œA Socialist?â€ laughed Alyosha. â€œBut when have you had time to become one?
939987 [25704] Why, I thought you were only thirteen?â€
939987 [25705] 
939987 [25706] Kolya winced.
939987 [25707] 
939987 [25708] â€œIn the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in a
939987 [25709] fortnight,â€ he flushed angrily, â€œand in the second place I am at a
939987 [25710] complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The question is
939987 [25711] what are my convictions, not what is my age, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [25712] 
939987 [25713] â€œWhen you are older, youâ€™ll understand for yourself the influence of age
939987 [25714] on convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your own
939987 [25715] ideas,â€ Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya interrupted him
939987 [25716] hotly:
939987 [25717] 
939987 [25718] â€œCome, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the Christian
939987 [25719] religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and the powerful
939987 [25720] to keep the lower classes in slavery. Thatâ€™s so, isnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [25721] 
939987 [25722] â€œAh, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!â€
939987 [25723] cried Alyosha.
939987 [25724] 
939987 [25725] â€œI say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me so. I
939987 [25726] can think for myself.... I am not opposed to Christ, if you like. He was a
939987 [25727] most humane person, and if He were alive to-day, He would be found in the
939987 [25728] ranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a conspicuous part....
939987 [25729] Thereâ€™s no doubt about that.â€
939987 [25730] 
939987 [25731] â€œOh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made friends
939987 [25732] with?â€ exclaimed Alyosha.
939987 [25733] 
939987 [25734] â€œCome, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked to
939987 [25735] Mr. Rakitin, of course, but ... old Byelinsky said that, too, so they
939987 [25736] say.â€
939987 [25737] 
939987 [25738] â€œByelinsky? I donâ€™t remember. He hasnâ€™t written that anywhere.â€
939987 [25739] 
939987 [25740] â€œIf he didnâ€™t write it, they say he said it. I heard that from a ... but
939987 [25741] never mind.â€
939987 [25742] 
939987 [25743] â€œAnd have you read Byelinsky?â€
939987 [25744] 
939987 [25745] â€œWell, no ... I havenâ€™t read all of him, but ... I read the passage about
939987 [25746] Tatyana, why she didnâ€™t go off with Onyegin.â€
939987 [25747] 
939987 [25748] â€œDidnâ€™t go off with Onyegin? Surely you donâ€™t ... understand that
939987 [25749] already?â€
939987 [25750] 
939987 [25751] â€œWhy, you seem to take me for little Smurov,â€ said Kolya, with a grin of
939987 [25752] irritation. â€œBut please donâ€™t suppose I am such a revolutionist. I often
939987 [25753] disagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at all for
939987 [25754] the emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a subject race and
939987 [25755] must obey. _Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.â€ Kolya, for some
939987 [25756] reason, smiled, â€œAnd on that question at least I am quite of one mind with
939987 [25757] that pseudo-great man. I think, too, that to leave oneâ€™s own country and
939987 [25758] fly to America is mean, worse than meanâ€”silly. Why go to America when one
939987 [25759] may be of great service to humanity here? Now especially. Thereâ€™s a
939987 [25760] perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us. Thatâ€™s what I answered.â€
939987 [25761] 
939987 [25762] â€œWhat do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going to
939987 [25763] America already?â€
939987 [25764] 
939987 [25765] â€œI must own, theyâ€™ve been at me to go, but I declined. Thatâ€™s between
939987 [25766] ourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one. I say
939987 [25767] this only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the
939987 [25768] secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.
939987 [25769] 
939987 [25770] 
939987 [25771]     _Long will you remember_
939987 [25772]     _The house at the Chain bridge._
939987 [25773] 
939987 [25774] 
939987 [25775] Do you remember? Itâ€™s splendid. Why are you laughing? You donâ€™t suppose I
939987 [25776] am fibbing, do you?â€ (â€œWhat if he should find out that Iâ€™ve only that one
939987 [25777] number of _The Bell_ in fatherâ€™s bookcase, and havenâ€™t read any more of
939987 [25778] it?â€ Kolya thought with a shudder.)
939987 [25779] 
939987 [25780] â€œOh, no, I am not laughing and donâ€™t suppose for a moment that you are
939987 [25781] lying. No, indeed, I canâ€™t suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly
939987 [25782] true. But tell me, have you read Pushkinâ€”_Onyegin_, for instance?... You
939987 [25783] spoke just now of Tatyana.â€
939987 [25784] 
939987 [25785] â€œNo, I havenâ€™t read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no prejudices,
939987 [25786] Karamazov; I want to hear both sides. What makes you ask?â€
939987 [25787] 
939987 [25788] â€œOh, nothing.â€
939987 [25789] 
939987 [25790] â€œTell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?â€ Kolya rapped out
939987 [25791] suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he were on drill.
939987 [25792] â€œBe so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.â€
939987 [25793] 
939987 [25794] â€œI have a contempt for you?â€ Alyosha looked at him wondering. â€œWhat for? I
939987 [25795] am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by
939987 [25796] all this crude nonsense before you have begun life.â€
939987 [25797] 
939987 [25798] â€œDonâ€™t be anxious about my nature,â€ Kolya interrupted, not without
939987 [25799] complacency. â€œBut itâ€™s true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely
939987 [25800] sensitive. You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed toâ€”â€
939987 [25801] 
939987 [25802] â€œOh, my smile meant something quite different. Iâ€™ll tell you why I smiled.
939987 [25803] Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in
939987 [25804] Russia, on our students and schoolboys of to-day. â€˜Show a Russian
939987 [25805] schoolboy,â€™ he writes, â€˜a map of the stars, which he knows nothing about,
939987 [25806] and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.â€™ No
939987 [25807] knowledge and unbounded conceitâ€”thatâ€™s what the German meant to say about
939987 [25808] the Russian schoolboy.â€
939987 [25809] 
939987 [25810] â€œYes, thatâ€™s perfectly right,â€ Kolya laughed suddenly, â€œexactly so! Bravo
939987 [25811] the German! But he did not see the good side, what do you think? Conceit
939987 [25812] may be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, on
939987 [25813] the other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood,
939987 [25814] boldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these sausage
939987 [25815] makers, groveling before authority.... But the German was right all the
939987 [25816] same. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same. Though
939987 [25817] they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled.â€
939987 [25818] 
939987 [25819] â€œStrangled, what for?â€ smiled Alyosha.
939987 [25820] 
939987 [25821] â€œWell, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childish
939987 [25822] sometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I canâ€™t restrain myself
939987 [25823] and am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are chattering away here
939987 [25824] about nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there. But perhaps
939987 [25825] heâ€™s examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked that Nina,
939987 [25826] you know. She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away, â€˜Why didnâ€™t
939987 [25827] you come before?â€™ And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she is
939987 [25828] awfully nice and pathetic.â€
939987 [25829] 
939987 [25830] â€œYes, yes! Well, youâ€™ll be coming often, you will see what she is like. It
939987 [25831] would do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn to
939987 [25832] value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,â€
939987 [25833] Alyosha observed warmly. â€œThat would have more effect on you than
939987 [25834] anything.â€
939987 [25835] 
939987 [25836] â€œOh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!â€ Kolya
939987 [25837] exclaimed, with bitter feeling.
939987 [25838] 
939987 [25839] â€œYes, itâ€™s a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child
939987 [25840] was to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!â€
939987 [25841] 
939987 [25842] â€œDonâ€™t tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept me
939987 [25843] from coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly
939987 [25844] wilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though Iâ€™ve been struggling
939987 [25845] with it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways,
939987 [25846] Karamazov!â€
939987 [25847] 
939987 [25848] â€œNo, you have a charming nature, though itâ€™s been distorted, and I quite
939987 [25849] understand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidly
939987 [25850] sensitive boy,â€ Alyosha answered warmly.
939987 [25851] 
939987 [25852] â€œAnd you say that to me!â€ cried Kolya; â€œand would you believe it, I
939987 [25853] thoughtâ€”Iâ€™ve thought several times since Iâ€™ve been hereâ€”that you despised
939987 [25854] me! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!â€
939987 [25855] 
939987 [25856] â€œBut are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it, just
939987 [25857] now, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, that
939987 [25858] you must be very sensitive!â€
939987 [25859] 
939987 [25860] â€œYou thought so? What an eye youâ€™ve got, I say! I bet that was when I was
939987 [25861] talking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you had a great
939987 [25862] contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for a moment I
939987 [25863] quite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool. Then I fanciedâ€”just
939987 [25864] now, hereâ€”when I said that if there were no God He would have to be
939987 [25865] invented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge,
939987 [25866] especially as I got that phrase out of a book. But I swear I wasnâ€™t
939987 [25867] showing off out of vanity, though I really donâ€™t know why. Because I was
939987 [25868] so pleased? Yes, I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though itâ€™s
939987 [25869] perfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing directly they are pleased,
939987 [25870] I know that. But I am convinced now that you donâ€™t despise me; it was all
939987 [25871] my imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. I sometimes fancy
939987 [25872] all sorts of things, that every one is laughing at me, the whole world,
939987 [25873] and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things.â€
939987 [25874] 
939987 [25875] â€œAnd you worry every one about you,â€ smiled Alyosha.
939987 [25876] 
939987 [25877] â€œYes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tell
939987 [25878] me, am I very ridiculous now?â€
939987 [25879] 
939987 [25880] â€œDonâ€™t think about that, donâ€™t think of it at all!â€ cried Alyosha. â€œAnd
939987 [25881] what does ridiculous mean? Isnâ€™t every one constantly being or seeming
939987 [25882] ridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of
939987 [25883] being ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at is
939987 [25884] that you should be feeling that so early, though Iâ€™ve observed it for some
939987 [25885] time past, and not only in you. Nowadays the very children have begun to
939987 [25886] suffer from it. Itâ€™s almost a sort of insanity. The devil has taken the
939987 [25887] form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; itâ€™s simply the
939987 [25888] devil,â€ added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that Kolya, staring at
939987 [25889] him, expected to see. â€œYou are like every one else,â€ said Alyosha, in
939987 [25890] conclusion, â€œthat is, like very many others. Only you must not be like
939987 [25891] everybody else, thatâ€™s all.â€
939987 [25892] 
939987 [25893] â€œEven if every one is like that?â€
939987 [25894] 
939987 [25895] â€œYes, even if every one is like that. You be the only one not like it. You
939987 [25896] really are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to confess to
939987 [25897] something bad and even ridiculous. And who will admit so much in these
939987 [25898] days? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to
939987 [25899] self-criticism. Donâ€™t be like every one else, even if you are the only
939987 [25900] one.â€
939987 [25901] 
939987 [25902] â€œSplendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one. Oh, how
939987 [25903] I have longed to know you, Karamazov! Iâ€™ve long been eager for this
939987 [25904] meeting. Can you really have thought about me, too? You said just now that
939987 [25905] you thought of me, too?â€
939987 [25906] 
939987 [25907] â€œYes, Iâ€™d heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if itâ€™s partly
939987 [25908] vanity that makes you ask, it doesnâ€™t matter.â€
939987 [25909] 
939987 [25910] â€œDo you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,â€
939987 [25911] said Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice. â€œThatâ€™s not ridiculous, is
939987 [25912] it?â€
939987 [25913] 
939987 [25914] â€œNot at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldnâ€™t matter, because itâ€™s
939987 [25915] been a good thing.â€ Alyosha smiled brightly.
939987 [25916] 
939987 [25917] â€œBut do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed
939987 [25918] yourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.â€ Kolya smiled with a sort of sly
939987 [25919] happiness.
939987 [25920] 
939987 [25921] â€œWhy ashamed?â€
939987 [25922] 
939987 [25923] â€œWell, why are you blushing?â€
939987 [25924] 
939987 [25925] â€œIt was you made me blush,â€ laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. â€œOh,
939987 [25926] well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I donâ€™t know...â€ he muttered,
939987 [25927] almost embarrassed.
939987 [25928] 
939987 [25929] â€œOh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are
939987 [25930] rather ashamed! Because you are just like me,â€ cried Kolya, in positive
939987 [25931] ecstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.
939987 [25932] 
939987 [25933] â€œYou know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,â€ something made
939987 [25934] Alyosha say suddenly.
939987 [25935] 
939987 [25936] â€œI know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!â€ Kolya agreed at once.
939987 [25937] 
939987 [25938] â€œBut you will bless life on the whole, all the same.â€
939987 [25939] 
939987 [25940] â€œJust so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together,
939987 [25941] Karamazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quite
939987 [25942] like an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But
939987 [25943] we shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, Iâ€™ve been saying to
939987 [25944] myself, â€˜Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part
939987 [25945] enemies to the grave!â€™ â€
939987 [25946] 
939987 [25947] â€œAnd saying that, of course, you loved me,â€ Alyosha laughed gayly.
939987 [25948] 
939987 [25949] â€œI did. I loved you awfully. Iâ€™ve been loving and dreaming of you. And how
939987 [25950] do you know it all beforehand? Ah, hereâ€™s the doctor. Goodness! What will
939987 [25951] he tell us? Look at his face!â€
939987 [25952] 
939987 [25953] 
939987 [25954] 
939987 [25955] Chapter VII. Ilusha
939987 [25956] 
939987 [25957] 
939987 [25958] The doctor came out of the room again, muffled in his fur coat and with
939987 [25959] his cap on his head. His face looked almost angry and disgusted, as though
939987 [25960] he were afraid of getting dirty. He cast a cursory glance round the
939987 [25961] passage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so. Alyosha waved
939987 [25962] from the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought the
939987 [25963] doctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and, bowing
939987 [25964] apologetically, stopped him to get the last word. The poor fellow looked
939987 [25965] utterly crushed; there was a scared look in his eyes.
939987 [25966] 
939987 [25967] â€œYour Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?â€ he began, but could
939987 [25968] not go on and clasped his hands in despair. Yet he still gazed imploringly
939987 [25969] at the doctor, as though a word from him might still change the poor boyâ€™s
939987 [25970] fate.
939987 [25971] 
939987 [25972] â€œI canâ€™t help it, I am not God!â€ the doctor answered offhand, though with
939987 [25973] the customary impressiveness.
939987 [25974] 
939987 [25975] â€œDoctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?â€
939987 [25976] 
939987 [25977] â€œYou must be prepared for anything,â€ said the doctor in emphatic and
939987 [25978] incisive tones, and dropping his eyes, he was about to step out to the
939987 [25979] coach.
939987 [25980] 
939987 [25981] â€œYour Excellency, for Christâ€™s sake!â€ the terror-stricken captain stopped
939987 [25982] him again. â€œYour Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely nothing save him
939987 [25983] now?â€
939987 [25984] 
939987 [25985] â€œItâ€™s not in my hands now,â€ said the doctor impatiently, â€œbut hâ€™m!...â€ he
939987 [25986] stopped suddenly. â€œIf you could, for instance ... send ... your patient
939987 [25987] ... at once, without delayâ€ (the words â€œat once, without delay,â€ the
939987 [25988] doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain
939987 [25989] start) â€œto Syracuse, the change to the new be-ne-ficial climatic
939987 [25990] conditions might possibly effectâ€”â€
939987 [25991] 
939987 [25992] â€œTo Syracuse!â€ cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said.
939987 [25993] 
939987 [25994] â€œSyracuse is in Sicily,â€ Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation. The
939987 [25995] doctor looked at him.
939987 [25996] 
939987 [25997] â€œSicily! your Excellency,â€ faltered the captain, â€œbut youâ€™ve seenâ€â€”he
939987 [25998] spread out his hands, indicating his surroundingsâ€”â€œmamma and my family?â€
939987 [25999] 
939987 [26000] â€œNâ€”no, Sicily is not the place for the family, the family should go to
939987 [26001] Caucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus,
939987 [26002] and your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her
939987 [26003] rheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist
939987 [26004] Lepelletier; I could give you a note to him, and then ... there might be a
939987 [26005] changeâ€”â€
939987 [26006] 
939987 [26007] â€œDoctor, doctor! But you see!â€ The captain flung wide his hands again
939987 [26008] despairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.
939987 [26009] 
939987 [26010] â€œWell, thatâ€™s not my business,â€ grinned the doctor. â€œI have only told you
939987 [26011] the answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment.
939987 [26012] As for the rest, to my regretâ€”â€
939987 [26013] 
939987 [26014] â€œDonâ€™t be afraid, apothecary, my dog wonâ€™t bite you,â€ Kolya rapped out
939987 [26015] loudly, noticing the doctorâ€™s rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who was
939987 [26016] standing in the doorway. There was a wrathful note in Kolyaâ€™s voice. He
939987 [26017] used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he
939987 [26018] explained afterwards, used it â€œto insult him.â€
939987 [26019] 
939987 [26020] â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise at
939987 [26021] Kolya. â€œWhoâ€™s this?â€ he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him to
939987 [26022] explain.
939987 [26023] 
939987 [26024] â€œItâ€™s Perezvonâ€™s master, donâ€™t worry about me,â€ Kolya said incisively
939987 [26025] again.
939987 [26026] 
939987 [26027] â€œPerezvon?â€(7) repeated the doctor, perplexed.
939987 [26028] 
939987 [26029] â€œHe hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good-by, we shall meet
939987 [26030] in Syracuse.â€
939987 [26031] 
939987 [26032] â€œWhoâ€™s this? Whoâ€™s this?â€ The doctor flew into a terrible rage.
939987 [26033] 
939987 [26034] â€œHe is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice of
939987 [26035] him,â€ said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. â€œKolya, hold your
939987 [26036] tongue!â€ he cried to Krassotkin. â€œTake no notice of him, doctor,â€ he
939987 [26037] repeated, rather impatiently.
939987 [26038] 
939987 [26039] â€œHe wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!â€ The doctor stamped in a perfect
939987 [26040] fury.
939987 [26041] 
939987 [26042] â€œAnd you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!â€ said Kolya, turning
939987 [26043] pale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. â€œ_Ici_, Perezvon!â€
939987 [26044] 
939987 [26045] â€œKolya, if you say another word, Iâ€™ll have nothing more to do with you,â€
939987 [26046] Alyosha cried peremptorily.
939987 [26047] 
939987 [26048] â€œThere is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay
939987 [26049] Krassotkinâ€”this is the manâ€; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. â€œI obey him,
939987 [26050] good-by!â€
939987 [26051] 
939987 [26052] He stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room.
939987 [26053] Perezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds in
939987 [26054] amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out quickly to
939987 [26055] the carriage, repeating aloud, â€œThis is ... this is ... I donâ€™t know what
939987 [26056] it is!â€ The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage. Alyosha
939987 [26057] followed Kolya into the room. He was already by Ilushaâ€™s bedside. The sick
939987 [26058] boy was holding his hand and calling for his father. A minute later the
939987 [26059] captain, too, came back.
939987 [26060] 
939987 [26061] â€œFather, father, come ... we ...â€ Ilusha faltered in violent excitement,
939987 [26062] but apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms round his father
939987 [26063] and Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as tightly as he
939987 [26064] could. The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs, and Kolyaâ€™s
939987 [26065] lips and chin twitched.
939987 [26066] 
939987 [26067] â€œFather, father! How sorry I am for you!â€ Ilusha moaned bitterly.
939987 [26068] 
939987 [26069] â€œIlusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we
939987 [26070] shall be happy ... the doctor ...â€ the captain began.
939987 [26071] 
939987 [26072] â€œAh, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me.... I saw!â€
939987 [26073] cried Ilusha, and again he hugged them both with all his strength, hiding
939987 [26074] his face on his fatherâ€™s shoulder.
939987 [26075] 
939987 [26076] â€œFather, donâ€™t cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ... choose
939987 [26077] one of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha and love him instead of
939987 [26078] me....â€
939987 [26079] 
939987 [26080] â€œHush, old man, youâ€™ll get well,â€ Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice
939987 [26081] that sounded angry.
939987 [26082] 
939987 [26083] â€œBut donâ€™t ever forget me, father,â€ Ilusha went on, â€œcome to my grave ...
939987 [26084] and, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walk,
939987 [26085] and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... I
939987 [26086] shall expect you.... Father, father!â€
939987 [26087] 
939987 [26088] His voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was
939987 [26089] crying quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying, â€œmamma,â€
939987 [26090] too, burst into tears.
939987 [26091] 
939987 [26092] â€œIlusha! Ilusha!â€ she exclaimed.
939987 [26093] 
939987 [26094] Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilushaâ€™s embrace.
939987 [26095] 
939987 [26096] â€œGood-by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,â€ he said quickly.
939987 [26097] â€œWhat a pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious.... But
939987 [26098] after dinner Iâ€™ll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole
939987 [26099] evening, and Iâ€™ll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things. And
939987 [26100] Iâ€™ll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me, because he will
939987 [26101] begin to howl when I am away and bother you. Good-by!â€
939987 [26102] 
939987 [26103] And he ran out into the passage. He didnâ€™t want to cry, but in the passage
939987 [26104] he burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.
939987 [26105] 
939987 [26106] â€œKolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will be
939987 [26107] terribly disappointed,â€ Alyosha said emphatically.
939987 [26108] 
939987 [26109] â€œI will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before!â€ muttered
939987 [26110] Kolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.
939987 [26111] 
939987 [26112] At that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed the
939987 [26113] door behind him. His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling. He
939987 [26114] stood before the two and flung up his arms.
939987 [26115] 
939987 [26116] â€œI donâ€™t want a good boy! I donâ€™t want another boy!â€ he muttered in a wild
939987 [26117] whisper, clenching his teeth. â€œIf I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my
939987 [26118] tongueâ€”â€ He broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the wooden
939987 [26119] bench. Pressing his fists against his head, he began sobbing with absurd
939987 [26120] whimpering cries, doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in
939987 [26121] the room.
939987 [26122] 
939987 [26123] Kolya ran out into the street.
939987 [26124] 
939987 [26125] â€œGood-by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself?â€ he cried sharply and angrily
939987 [26126] to Alyosha.
939987 [26127] 
939987 [26128] â€œI will certainly come in the evening.â€
939987 [26129] 
939987 [26130] â€œWhat was that he said about Jerusalem?... What did he mean by that?â€
939987 [26131] 
939987 [26132] â€œItâ€™s from the Bible. â€˜If I forget thee, Jerusalem,â€™ that is, if I forget
939987 [26133] all that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its place, then
939987 [26134] mayâ€”â€
939987 [26135] 
939987 [26136] â€œI understand, thatâ€™s enough! Mind you come! _Ici_, Perezvon!â€ he cried
939987 [26137] with positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went home.
939987 [26138] 
939987 [26139]

939987 [26143] 
939987 [26144] 
939987 [26145] 
939987 [26146] Chapter I. At Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [26147] 
939987 [26148] 
939987 [26149] Alyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozovâ€™s house to
939987 [26150] see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an
939987 [26151] urgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned
939987 [26152] that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day.
939987 [26153] During the two months that had passed since Mityaâ€™s arrest, Alyosha had
939987 [26154] called frequently at the widow Morozovâ€™s house, both from his own
939987 [26155] inclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mityaâ€™s
939987 [26156] arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.
939987 [26157] For one whole week she was unconscious. She was very much changedâ€”thinner
939987 [26158] and a little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been well
939987 [26159] enough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than
939987 [26160] before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her. A look of
939987 [26161] firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face. There were
939987 [26162] signs of a spiritual transformation in her, and a steadfast, fine and
939987 [26163] humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her.
939987 [26164] There was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming
939987 [26165] face a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance.
939987 [26166] There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.
939987 [26167] 
939987 [26168] It seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that had
939987 [26169] overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a
939987 [26170] terrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of her
939987 [26171] illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka
939987 [26172] had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in the
939987 [26173] once proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire
939987 [26174] when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her
939987 [26175] heart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as everâ€”Katerina
939987 [26176] Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium.
939987 [26177] Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [26178] had not once visited Mitya in his prison, though she might have done it
939987 [26179] whenever she liked. All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he
939987 [26180] was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she
939987 [26181] was continually asking advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.
939987 [26182] 
939987 [26183] Full of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had returned
939987 [26184] from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement with
939987 [26185] which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been
939987 [26186] expecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game of
939987 [26187] â€œfoolsâ€ lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on
939987 [26188] the other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it. He wore a
939987 [26189] dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak,
939987 [26190] though he was smiling blissfully. When the homeless old man returned with
939987 [26191] Grushenka from Mokroe two months before, he had simply stayed on and was
939987 [26192] still staying with her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down on
939987 [26193] the sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid,
939987 [26194] appealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the first
939987 [26195] stage of fever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first
939987 [26196] half-hour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently:
939987 [26197] he laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She called Fenya and told her
939987 [26198] to give him something to eat. All that day he sat in the same place,
939987 [26199] almost without stirring. When it got dark and the shutters were closed,
939987 [26200] Fenya asked her mistress:
939987 [26201] 
939987 [26202] â€œIs the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?â€
939987 [26203] 
939987 [26204] â€œYes; make him a bed on the sofa,â€ answered Grushenka.
939987 [26205] 
939987 [26206] Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had
939987 [26207] literally nowhere to go, and that â€œMr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me
939987 [26208] straight that he wouldnâ€™t receive me again and gave me five roubles.â€
939987 [26209] 
939987 [26210] â€œWell, God bless you, youâ€™d better stay, then,â€ Grushenka decided in her
939987 [26211] grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old manâ€™s heart
939987 [26212] and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer
939987 [26213] had stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when she
939987 [26214] was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but
939987 [26215] went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had
939987 [26216] grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun
939987 [26217] to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and
939987 [26218] begin talking to â€œMaximushkaâ€ about trifling matters, to keep her from
939987 [26219] thinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story-teller
939987 [26220] on occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka saw
939987 [26221] scarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never
939987 [26222] stayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, â€œat his last
939987 [26223] gaspâ€ as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after
939987 [26224] Mityaâ€™s trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching,
939987 [26225] he made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last
939987 [26226] and bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict orders
939987 [26227] to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, â€œThe
939987 [26228] master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.â€
939987 [26229] But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.
939987 [26230] 
939987 [26231] â€œYouâ€™ve come at last!â€ she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully
939987 [26232] greeting Alyosha, â€œand Maximushkaâ€™s been scaring me that perhaps you
939987 [26233] wouldnâ€™t come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you
939987 [26234] haveâ€”coffee?â€
939987 [26235] 
939987 [26236] â€œYes, please,â€ said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. â€œI am very
939987 [26237] hungry.â€
939987 [26238] 
939987 [26239] â€œThatâ€™s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,â€ cried Grushenka. â€œItâ€™s been made a
939987 [26240] long time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they are
939987 [26241] hot. Do you know, weâ€™ve had a storm over those pies to-day. I took them to
939987 [26242] the prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: he
939987 [26243] would not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it.
939987 [26244] So I said to him: â€˜I shall leave them with the warder; if you donâ€™t eat
939987 [26245] them before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for
939987 [26246] you!â€™ With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it?
939987 [26247] Whenever I go we quarrel.â€
939987 [26248] 
939987 [26249] Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feeling
939987 [26250] nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.
939987 [26251] 
939987 [26252] â€œWhat did you quarrel about this time?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [26253] 
939987 [26254] â€œI didnâ€™t expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole.
939987 [26255] â€˜Why are you keeping him?â€™ he said. â€˜So youâ€™ve begun keeping him.â€™ He is
939987 [26256] jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping! He even
939987 [26257] took it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.â€
939987 [26258] 
939987 [26259] â€œBut he knew about the Pole before?â€
939987 [26260] 
939987 [26261] â€œYes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning, but
939987 [26262] to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed to
939987 [26263] repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps
939987 [26264] Rakitin is egging him on. What do you think?â€ she added carelessly.
939987 [26265] 
939987 [26266] â€œHe loves you, thatâ€™s what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is
939987 [26267] particularly worried.â€
939987 [26268] 
939987 [26269] â€œI should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I went to him
939987 [26270] to say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think whatâ€™s going to
939987 [26271] happen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And he
939987 [26272] talks about the Pole! Heâ€™s too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet,
939987 [26273] anyway.â€
939987 [26274] 
939987 [26275] â€œMy wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,â€ Maximov put in his word.
939987 [26276] 
939987 [26277] â€œJealous of you?â€ Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. â€œOf whom could
939987 [26278] she have been jealous?â€
939987 [26279] 
939987 [26280] â€œOf the servant girls.â€
939987 [26281] 
939987 [26282] â€œHold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry.
939987 [26283] Donâ€™t ogle the pies. I shanâ€™t give you any; they are not good for you, and
939987 [26284] I wonâ€™t give you any vodka either. I have to look after him, too, just as
939987 [26285] though I kept an almshouse,â€ she laughed.
939987 [26286] 
939987 [26287] â€œI donâ€™t deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,â€ said Maximov,
939987 [26288] with tears in his voice. â€œYou would do better to spend your kindness on
939987 [26289] people of more use than me.â€
939987 [26290] 
939987 [26291] â€œEch, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell whoâ€™s of most
939987 [26292] use? If only that Pole didnâ€™t exist, Alyosha. Heâ€™s taken it into his head
939987 [26293] to fall ill, too, to-day. Iâ€™ve been to see him also. And I shall send him
939987 [26294] some pies, too, on purpose. I hadnâ€™t sent him any, but Mitya accused me of
939987 [26295] it, so now I shall send some! Ah, hereâ€™s Fenya with a letter! Yes, itâ€™s
939987 [26296] from the Polesâ€”begging again!â€
939987 [26297] 
939987 [26298] Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically
939987 [26299] eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the
939987 [26300] letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it
939987 [26301] within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had
939987 [26302] received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former
939987 [26303] lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two
939987 [26304] Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first
939987 [26305] letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper
939987 [26306] and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical
939987 [26307] that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head
939987 [26308] or tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was
939987 [26309] followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a
939987 [26310] loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that
939987 [26311] letter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followedâ€”one every
939987 [26312] dayâ€”all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually
939987 [26313] diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten,
939987 [26314] and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her
939987 [26315] for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.
939987 [26316] 
939987 [26317] Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round
939987 [26318] herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost
939987 [26319] destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their
939987 [26320] landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at
939987 [26321] Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting
939987 [26322] her with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio
939987 [26323] and pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former
939987 [26324] admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not
939987 [26325] in the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to
939987 [26326] Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had
939987 [26327] always sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into his
939987 [26328] head to be fearfully jealous.
939987 [26329] 
939987 [26330] â€œLike a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see
939987 [26331] Mitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,â€ Grushenka began again with nervous
939987 [26332] haste. â€œI was laughing, telling Mitya about it. â€˜Fancy,â€™ I said, â€˜my Pole
939987 [26333] had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar. He
939987 [26334] thought I would be touched and marry him!â€™ Mitya leapt up swearing.... So,
939987 [26335] there, Iâ€™ll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl theyâ€™ve
939987 [26336] sent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and
939987 [26337] tell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did
939987 [26338] send them the pies.â€
939987 [26339] 
939987 [26340] â€œI wouldnâ€™t tell him for anything,â€ said Alyosha, smiling.
939987 [26341] 
939987 [26342] â€œEch! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, heâ€™s jealous on purpose. He
939987 [26343] doesnâ€™t care,â€ said Grushenka bitterly.
939987 [26344] 
939987 [26345] â€œOn purpose?â€ queried Alyosha.
939987 [26346] 
939987 [26347] â€œI tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all
939987 [26348] your cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me. I
939987 [26349] would be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am not
939987 [26350] offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous myself.
939987 [26351] Only what offends me is that he doesnâ€™t love me at all. I tell you he is
939987 [26352] jealous now _on purpose_. Am I blind? Donâ€™t I see? He began talking to me
939987 [26353] just now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this and that, how she
939987 [26354] had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she had
939987 [26355] ordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves her, if
939987 [26356] heâ€™ll praise her to my face, more shame to him! Heâ€™s treated me badly
939987 [26357] himself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throw
939987 [26358] it all on me. â€˜You were with your Pole before me, so I canâ€™t be blamed for
939987 [26359] Katerina,â€™ thatâ€™s what it amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame on
939987 [26360] me. He attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but Iâ€™llâ€”â€
939987 [26361] 
939987 [26362] Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes in
939987 [26363] her handkerchief and sobbed violently.
939987 [26364] 
939987 [26365] â€œHe doesnâ€™t love Katerina Ivanovna,â€ said Alyosha firmly.
939987 [26366] 
939987 [26367] â€œWell, whether he loves her or not, Iâ€™ll soon find out for myself,â€ said
939987 [26368] Grushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief from
939987 [26369] her eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being
939987 [26370] mild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful.
939987 [26371] 
939987 [26372] â€œEnough of this foolishness,â€ she said suddenly; â€œitâ€™s not for that I sent
939987 [26373] for you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrowâ€”what will happen to-morrow? Thatâ€™s
939987 [26374] what worries me! And itâ€™s only me it worries! I look at every one and no
939987 [26375] one is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you thinking about it
939987 [26376] even? To-morrow heâ€™ll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried?
939987 [26377] You know itâ€™s the valet, the valet killed him! Good heavens! Can they
939987 [26378] condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him? They
939987 [26379] havenâ€™t troubled the valet at all, have they?â€
939987 [26380] 
939987 [26381] â€œHeâ€™s been severely cross-examined,â€ observed Alyosha thoughtfully; â€œbut
939987 [26382] every one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying very ill.
939987 [26383] He has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,â€ added Alyosha.
939987 [26384] 
939987 [26385] â€œOh, dear! couldnâ€™t you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole
939987 [26386] thing by yourself? Heâ€™s been brought from Petersburg for three thousand
939987 [26387] roubles, they say.â€
939987 [26388] 
939987 [26389] â€œWe gave these three thousand togetherâ€”Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and Iâ€”but
939987 [26390] she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counsel
939987 [26391] Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known all
939987 [26392] over Russia; itâ€™s talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitch
939987 [26393] agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has
939987 [26394] become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.â€
939987 [26395] 
939987 [26396] â€œWell? Did you talk to him?â€ Grushenka put in eagerly.
939987 [26397] 
939987 [26398] â€œHe listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his
939987 [26399] opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.â€
939987 [26400] 
939987 [26401] â€œConsideration! Ah, they are swindlers! Theyâ€™ll ruin him. And why did she
939987 [26402] send for the doctor?â€
939987 [26403] 
939987 [26404] â€œAs an expert. They want to prove that Mityaâ€™s mad and committed the
939987 [26405] murder when he didnâ€™t know what he was doingâ€; Alyosha smiled gently; â€œbut
939987 [26406] Mitya wonâ€™t agree to that.â€
939987 [26407] 
939987 [26408] â€œYes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!â€ cried Grushenka.
939987 [26409] â€œHe was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am!
939987 [26410] But, of course, he didnâ€™t do it, he didnâ€™t do it! And they are all against
939987 [26411] him, the whole town. Even Fenyaâ€™s evidence went to prove he had done it.
939987 [26412] And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too,
939987 [26413] before, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, all
939987 [26414] crying out against him.â€
939987 [26415] 
939987 [26416] â€œYes, thereâ€™s a fearful accumulation of evidence,â€ Alyosha observed
939987 [26417] grimly.
939987 [26418] 
939987 [26419] â€œAnd Grigoryâ€”Grigory Vassilyevitchâ€”sticks to his story that the door was
939987 [26420] open, persists that he saw itâ€”thereâ€™s no shaking him. I went and talked to
939987 [26421] him myself. Heâ€™s rude about it, too.â€
939987 [26422] 
939987 [26423] â€œYes, thatâ€™s perhaps the strongest evidence against him,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [26424] 
939987 [26425] â€œAnd as for Mityaâ€™s being mad, he certainly seems like it now,â€ Grushenka
939987 [26426] began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. â€œDo you know, Alyosha,
939987 [26427] Iâ€™ve been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time. I go to him
939987 [26428] every day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose heâ€™s
939987 [26429] always talking about? He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I
939987 [26430] fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I couldnâ€™t
939987 [26431] understand in my foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a
939987 [26432] babeâ€”that is, about some child. â€˜Why is the babe poor?â€™ he said. â€˜Itâ€™s for
939987 [26433] that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to
939987 [26434] Siberia!â€™ What that meant, what babe, I couldnâ€™t tell for the life of me.
939987 [26435] Only I cried when he said it, because he said it so nicely. He cried
939987 [26436] himself, and I cried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the
939987 [26437] cross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?â€
939987 [26438] 
939987 [26439] â€œIt must be Rakitin, whoâ€™s been going to see him lately,â€ smiled Alyosha,
939987 [26440] â€œthough ... thatâ€™s not Rakitinâ€™s doing. I didnâ€™t see Mitya yesterday. Iâ€™ll
939987 [26441] see him to-day.â€
939987 [26442] 
939987 [26443] â€œNo, itâ€™s not Rakitin; itâ€™s his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him.
939987 [26444] Itâ€™s his going to see him, thatâ€™s what it is,â€ Grushenka began, and
939987 [26445] suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.
939987 [26446] 
939987 [26447] â€œIvanâ€™s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan
939987 [26448] hasnâ€™t been once.â€
939987 [26449] 
939987 [26450] â€œThere ... there! What a girl I am! Blurring things out!â€ exclaimed
939987 [26451] Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. â€œStay, Alyosha, hush! Since
939987 [26452] Iâ€™ve said so much Iâ€™ll tell the whole truthâ€”heâ€™s been to see him twice,
939987 [26453] the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of
939987 [26454] course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He
939987 [26455] told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to
939987 [26456] tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.â€
939987 [26457] 
939987 [26458] Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently
939987 [26459] impressed him.
939987 [26460] 
939987 [26461] â€œIvan doesnâ€™t talk to me of Mityaâ€™s case,â€ he said slowly. â€œHeâ€™s said very
939987 [26462] little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems
939987 [26463] vexed at my coming, so Iâ€™ve not been to him for the last three weeks.
939987 [26464] Hâ€™m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change
939987 [26465] in Mitya this week.â€
939987 [26466] 
939987 [26467] â€œThere has been a change,â€ Grushenka assented quickly. â€œThey have a
939987 [26468] secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and
939987 [26469] such a secret that Mitya canâ€™t rest. Before then, he was cheerfulâ€”and,
939987 [26470] indeed, he is cheerful nowâ€”but when he shakes his head like that, you
939987 [26471] know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his
939987 [26472] right temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind
939987 [26473] worrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is
939987 [26474] cheerful to-day.â€
939987 [26475] 
939987 [26476] â€œBut you said he was worried.â€
939987 [26477] 
939987 [26478] â€œYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a
939987 [26479] minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha,
939987 [26480] I am constantly wondering at himâ€”with this awful thing hanging over him,
939987 [26481] he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.â€
939987 [26482] 
939987 [26483] â€œAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, â€˜Donâ€™t
939987 [26484] tell himâ€™?â€
939987 [26485] 
939987 [26486] â€œYes, he told me, â€˜Donâ€™t tell him.â€™ Itâ€™s you that Mityaâ€™s most afraid of.
939987 [26487] Because itâ€™s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling,
939987 [26488] go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,â€
939987 [26489] Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. â€œSet my mind at rest that I
939987 [26490] may know the worst thatâ€™s in store for me. Thatâ€™s why I sent for you.â€
939987 [26491] 
939987 [26492] â€œYou think itâ€™s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldnâ€™t have
939987 [26493] told you there was a secret.â€
939987 [26494] 
939987 [26495] â€œI donâ€™t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesnâ€™t dare to. He warns
939987 [26496] me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he wonâ€™t tell me what it is.â€
939987 [26497] 
939987 [26498] â€œWhat do you think yourself?â€
939987 [26499] 
939987 [26500] â€œWhat do I think? Itâ€™s the end for me, thatâ€™s what I think. They all three
939987 [26501] have been plotting my end, for Katerinaâ€™s in it. Itâ€™s all Katerina, it all
939987 [26502] comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He
939987 [26503] tells me that beforehandâ€”warns me. He is planning to throw me over, thatâ€™s
939987 [26504] the whole secret. Theyâ€™ve planned it together, the three of themâ€”Mitya,
939987 [26505] Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, Iâ€™ve been wanting to ask you a
939987 [26506] long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with
939987 [26507] Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or
939987 [26508] not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.â€
939987 [26509] 
939987 [26510] â€œI wonâ€™t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I
939987 [26511] think.â€
939987 [26512] 
939987 [26513] â€œOh, thatâ€™s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, thatâ€™s
939987 [26514] what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on
939987 [26515] me afterwards. He is stupid, he canâ€™t disguise what he is doing; he is so
939987 [26516] open, you know.... But Iâ€™ll give it to him, Iâ€™ll give it to him! â€˜You
939987 [26517] believe I did it,â€™ he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me
939987 [26518] with that! God forgive him! You wait, Iâ€™ll make it hot for Katerina at the
939987 [26519] trial! Iâ€™ll just say a word then ... Iâ€™ll tell everything then!â€
939987 [26520] 
939987 [26521] And again she cried bitterly.
939987 [26522] 
939987 [26523] â€œThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,â€ Alyosha said, getting up.
939987 [26524] â€œFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and
939987 [26525] you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I donâ€™t
939987 [26526] want to worm his secret out of him, but if heâ€™ll tell me of himself
939987 [26527] to-day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you.
939987 [26528] Then Iâ€™ll come to you to-day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina
939987 [26529] Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something
939987 [26530] else. Thatâ€™s certain. It isnâ€™t likely itâ€™s about Katerina Ivanovna, it
939987 [26531] seems to me. Good-by for now.â€
939987 [26532] 
939987 [26533] Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that she
939987 [26534] put little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had her
939987 [26535] sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her in such a
939987 [26536] state of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many things to do
939987 [26537] still.
939987 [26538] 
939987 [26539] 
939987 [26540] 
939987 [26541] Chapter II. The Injured Foot
939987 [26542] 
939987 [26543] 
939987 [26544] The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and he
939987 [26545] hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late
939987 [26546] for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three
939987 [26547] weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she was not in
939987 [26548] bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in a
939987 [26549] fascinating but decorous _dÃ©shabillÃ©_. Alyosha had once noted with
939987 [26550] innocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov had
939987 [26551] begun to be rather dressyâ€”top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made
939987 [26552] their appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed
939987 [26553] such ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the
939987 [26554] young official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.
939987 [26555] 
939987 [26556] Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight to
939987 [26557] Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to him
939987 [26558] the previous day, specially asking him to come to her â€œabout something
939987 [26559] very important,â€ a request which, for certain reasons, had interest for
939987 [26560] Alyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise, Madame
939987 [26561] Hohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and immediately sent to beg
939987 [26562] him to come to her â€œjust for one minute.â€ Alyosha reflected that it was
939987 [26563] better to accede to the mammaâ€™s request, or else she would be sending down
939987 [26564] to Liseâ€™s room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lying
939987 [26565] on a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a
939987 [26566] state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries of
939987 [26567] rapture.
939987 [26568] 
939987 [26569] â€œItâ€™s ages, ages, perfect ages since Iâ€™ve seen you! Itâ€™s a whole weekâ€”only
939987 [26570] think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday. You
939987 [26571] have come to see Lise. Iâ€™m sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe,
939987 [26572] without my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only
939987 [26573] knew how worried I am about her! But of that later, though thatâ€™s the most
939987 [26574] important thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you
939987 [26575] implicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossimaâ€”God rest his
939987 [26576] soul!â€ (she crossed herself)â€”â€œI look upon you as a monk, though you look
939987 [26577] charming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in these
939987 [26578] parts? No, no, thatâ€™s not the chief thingâ€”of that later. Forgive me for
939987 [26579] sometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,â€
939987 [26580] she smiled coquettishly; â€œbut that will do later, too. The important thing
939987 [26581] is that I shouldnâ€™t forget what is important. Please remind me of it
939987 [26582] yourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say â€˜the
939987 [26583] important thing?â€™ Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever
939987 [26584] since Lise took back her promiseâ€”her childish promise, Alexey
939987 [26585] Fyodorovitchâ€”to marry you, youâ€™ve realized, of course, that it was only
939987 [26586] the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her
939987 [26587] chairâ€”thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from
939987 [26588] Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrowâ€”But why speak of
939987 [26589] to-morrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to
939987 [26590] die of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I
939987 [26591] paid him fifty roubles for the visit. But thatâ€™s not the point, thatâ€™s not
939987 [26592] the point again. You see, Iâ€™m mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry.
939987 [26593] Why am I in a hurry? I donâ€™t understand. Itâ€™s awful how I seem growing
939987 [26594] unable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of
939987 [26595] tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and
939987 [26596] that will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here and
939987 [26597] no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!â€
939987 [26598] 
939987 [26599] Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just had
939987 [26600] coffee.
939987 [26601] 
939987 [26602] â€œWhere?â€
939987 [26603] 
939987 [26604] â€œAt Agrafena Alexandrovnaâ€™s.â€
939987 [26605] 
939987 [26606] â€œAt ... at that womanâ€™s? Ah, itâ€™s she has brought ruin on every one. I
939987 [26607] know nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though itâ€™s
939987 [26608] rather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What use is it
939987 [26609] now? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you
939987 [26610] that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall
939987 [26611] certainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my
939987 [26612] chair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, I
939987 [26613] am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I donâ€™t know what I
939987 [26614] shall say. One has to take an oath, hasnâ€™t one?â€
939987 [26615] 
939987 [26616] â€œYes; but I donâ€™t think you will be able to go.â€
939987 [26617] 
939987 [26618] â€œI can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, and
939987 [26619] then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all this
939987 [26620] so quickly, so quickly, everythingâ€™s changing, and at lastâ€”nothing. All
939987 [26621] grow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary.
939987 [26622] This Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has disappointed all my hopes. Now
939987 [26623] she is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia, and your other
939987 [26624] brother is going to follow her, and will live in the nearest town, and
939987 [26625] they will all torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of
939987 [26626] allâ€”the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the
939987 [26627] papers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, thereâ€™s a
939987 [26628] paragraph that I was â€˜a dear friendâ€™ of your brotherâ€™s â€”â€”, I canâ€™t repeat
939987 [26629] the horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!â€
939987 [26630] 
939987 [26631] â€œImpossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?â€
939987 [26632] 
939987 [26633] â€œIâ€™ll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here, in
939987 [26634] the Petersburg paper _Gossip_. The paper began coming out this year. I am
939987 [26635] awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me outâ€”this is
939987 [26636] what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.â€
939987 [26637] 
939987 [26638] And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her
939987 [26639] pillow.
939987 [26640] 
939987 [26641] It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps
939987 [26642] everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The paragraph was
939987 [26643] very typical, and must have been a great shock to her, but, fortunately
939987 [26644] perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that
939987 [26645] moment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite
939987 [26646] forget the newspaper.
939987 [26647] 
939987 [26648] Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all
939987 [26649] over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother, about
939987 [26650] the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of those two
939987 [26651] months, among other equally credible items! One paper had even stated that
939987 [26652] he had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his brotherâ€™s
939987 [26653] crime. Another contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, Father
939987 [26654] Zossima, had broken into the monastery chest and â€œmade tracks from the
939987 [26655] monastery.â€ The present paragraph in the paper _Gossip_ was under the
939987 [26656] heading, â€œThe Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.â€ (That, alas! was the
939987 [26657] name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief,
939987 [26658] and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it. No names appeared,
939987 [26659] in fact. It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trial
939987 [26660] was making such a sensationâ€”retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and
939987 [26661] reactionary bullyâ€”was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and
939987 [26662] particularly popular with certain ladies â€œwho were pining in solitude.â€
939987 [26663] One such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a
939987 [26664] grown-up daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the
939987 [26665] crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he would
939987 [26666] elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on escaping
939987 [26667] punishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousand
939987 [26668] rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his pining
939987 [26669] lady. This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst of
939987 [26670] generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately
939987 [26671] abolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha
939987 [26672] folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.
939987 [26673] 
939987 [26674] â€œWell, that must be me,â€ she hurried on again. â€œOf course I am meant.
939987 [26675] Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and here
939987 [26676] they talk of â€˜middle-aged charmsâ€™ as though that were my motive! He writes
939987 [26677] that out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as
939987 [26678] I forgive him! You know itâ€™sâ€” Do you know who it is? Itâ€™s your friend
939987 [26679] Rakitin.â€
939987 [26680] 
939987 [26681] â€œPerhaps,â€ said Alyosha, â€œthough Iâ€™ve heard nothing about it.â€
939987 [26682] 
939987 [26683] â€œItâ€™s he, itâ€™s he! No â€˜perhapsâ€™ about it. You know I turned him out of the
939987 [26684] house.... You know all that story, donâ€™t you?â€
939987 [26685] 
939987 [26686] â€œI know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why it
939987 [26687] was, I havenâ€™t heard ... from you, at least.â€
939987 [26688] 
939987 [26689] â€œAh, then youâ€™ve heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me
939987 [26690] dreadfully?â€
939987 [26691] 
939987 [26692] â€œYes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why youâ€™ve given him up I
939987 [26693] havenâ€™t heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed. We are
939987 [26694] not friends.â€
939987 [26695] 
939987 [26696] â€œWell, then, Iâ€™ll tell you all about it. Thereâ€™s no help for it, Iâ€™ll
939987 [26697] confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a
939987 [26698] little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesnâ€™t count. You see, my
939987 [26699] dear boyâ€â€”Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, though
939987 [26700] enigmatic, smile played about her lipsâ€”â€œyou see, I suspect ... You must
939987 [26701] forgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite the
939987 [26702] contrary. I speak to you now as though you were my fatherâ€”motherâ€™s quite
939987 [26703] out of place. Well, itâ€™s as though I were confessing to Father Zossima,
939987 [26704] thatâ€™s just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man,
939987 [26705] your friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I canâ€™t be angry with him. I feel
939987 [26706] cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe it,
939987 [26707] seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I only
939987 [26708] noticed it later. At firstâ€”a month agoâ€”he only began to come oftener to
939987 [26709] see me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before. I
939987 [26710] knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to
939987 [26711] notice things with surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest,
939987 [26712] charming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whoâ€™s in the
939987 [26713] service here, began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him here
939987 [26714] ever so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man,
939987 [26715] isnâ€™t he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I should
939987 [26716] be glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I
939987 [26717] love young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost
939987 [26718] the mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,
939987 [26719] certainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On that
939987 [26720] awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And your
939987 [26721] friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on the
939987 [26722] carpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as he
939987 [26723] was going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swell
939987 [26724] directly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here
939987 [26725] before, and would you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at
939987 [26726] him, for some reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and
939987 [26727] laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here aloneâ€”no, I was laid up then.
939987 [26728] Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only
939987 [26729] fancy! brought me some verses of his own compositionâ€”a short poem, on my
939987 [26730] bad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minuteâ€”how did
939987 [26731] it go?
939987 [26732] 
939987 [26733] 
939987 [26734]     A captivating little foot.
939987 [26735] 
939987 [26736] 
939987 [26737] It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. Iâ€™ve got it here.
939987 [26738] Iâ€™ll show it to you later. But itâ€™s a charming thingâ€”charming; and, you
939987 [26739] know, itâ€™s not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too, a charming
939987 [26740] idea, only Iâ€™ve forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing for an album.
939987 [26741] So, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently flattered. Iâ€™d hardly
939987 [26742] had time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly
939987 [26743] looked as black as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way,
939987 [26744] for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses.
939987 [26745] I had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr
939987 [26746] Ilyitch the verses and didnâ€™t say who was the author. But I am convinced
939987 [26747] that he guessed, though he wonâ€™t own it to this day, and declares he had
939987 [26748] no idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at
939987 [26749] once, and fell to criticizing it. â€˜Wretched doggerel,â€™ he said they were,
939987 [26750] â€˜some divinity student must have written them,â€™ and with such vehemence,
939987 [26751] such vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage.
939987 [26752] â€˜Good gracious!â€™ I thought, â€˜theyâ€™ll fly at each other.â€™ â€˜It was I who
939987 [26753] wrote them,â€™ said he. â€˜I wrote them as a joke,â€™ he said, â€˜for I think it
939987 [26754] degrading to write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a
939987 [26755] monument to your Pushkin for writing about womenâ€™s feet, while I wrote
939987 [26756] with a moral purpose, and you,â€™ said he, â€˜are an advocate of serfdom.
939987 [26757] Youâ€™ve no humane ideas,â€™ said he. â€˜You have no modern enlightened
939987 [26758] feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,â€™ he
939987 [26759] said, â€˜and you take bribes.â€™ Then I began screaming and imploring them.
939987 [26760] And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took up
939987 [26761] the most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and
939987 [26762] apologized. â€˜Iâ€™d no idea,â€™ said he. â€˜I shouldnâ€™t have said it, if I had
939987 [26763] known. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,â€™ he said. In
939987 [26764] short, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He
939987 [26765] explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in
939987 [26766] earnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, â€˜Would
939987 [26767] it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for
939987 [26768] shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?â€™ And, would you believe it, I
939987 [26769] lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not.
939987 [26770] I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldnâ€™t
939987 [26771] make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be
939987 [26772] telling me, â€˜Speak,â€™ and the other â€˜No, donâ€™t speak.â€™ And no sooner had
939987 [26773] the second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there
939987 [26774] was a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, â€˜Itâ€™s painful for me to
939987 [26775] say it, but I donâ€™t wish to see you in my house again.â€™ So I turned him
939987 [26776] out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it
939987 [26777] on. I wasnâ€™t angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fanciedâ€”that
939987 [26778] was what did itâ€”that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believe
939987 [26779] me, it was quite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for several
939987 [26780] days afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it.
939987 [26781] So itâ€™s a fortnight since heâ€™s been here, and I kept wondering whether he
939987 [26782] would come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night came
939987 [26783] this _Gossip_. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must
939987 [26784] have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,
939987 [26785] and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, itâ€™s
939987 [26786] awful how I keep talking and donâ€™t say what I want to say. Ah! the words
939987 [26787] come of themselves!â€
939987 [26788] 
939987 [26789] â€œItâ€™s very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,â€
939987 [26790] Alyosha faltered.
939987 [26791] 
939987 [26792] â€œTo be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is an
939987 [26793] aberration?â€
939987 [26794] 
939987 [26795] â€œWhat aberration?â€ asked Alyosha, wondering.
939987 [26796] 
939987 [26797] â€œIn the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.
939987 [26798] Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.â€
939987 [26799] 
939987 [26800] â€œWhat do you mean?â€
939987 [26801] 
939987 [26802] â€œIâ€™ll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming creature,
939987 [26803] only I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She was with me
939987 [26804] some time ago and I couldnâ€™t get anything out of her. Especially as she
939987 [26805] wonâ€™t talk to me except on the surface now. She is always talking about my
939987 [26806] health and nothing else, and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I
939987 [26807] simply said to myself, â€˜Well, so be it. I donâ€™t careâ€™... Oh, yes. I was
939987 [26808] talking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come?
939987 [26809] Of course, you know itâ€”the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him.
939987 [26810] No, it wasnâ€™t you, but Katya. Itâ€™s all Katyaâ€™s doing. Well, you see, a man
939987 [26811] may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may be
939987 [26812] conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration.
939987 [26813] And thereâ€™s no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from
939987 [26814] aberration. They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were
939987 [26815] reformed. Itâ€™s all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor
939987 [26816] has been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.
939987 [26817] â€˜How did he seem then?â€™ he asked me. He must have been in a state of
939987 [26818] aberration. He came in shouting, â€˜Money, money, three thousand! Give me
939987 [26819] three thousand!â€™ and then went away and immediately did the murder. â€˜I
939987 [26820] donâ€™t want to murder him,â€™ he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him.
939987 [26821] Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet he
939987 [26822] murdered him.â€
939987 [26823] 
939987 [26824] â€œBut he didnâ€™t murder him,â€ Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He felt
939987 [26825] more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.
939987 [26826] 
939987 [26827] â€œYes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.â€
939987 [26828] 
939987 [26829] â€œGrigory?â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [26830] 
939987 [26831] â€œYes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down,
939987 [26832] and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.â€
939987 [26833] 
939987 [26834] â€œBut why, why?â€
939987 [26835] 
939987 [26836] â€œSuffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri
939987 [26837] Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he
939987 [26838] went and committed the murder. As for his saying he didnâ€™t, he very likely
939987 [26839] doesnâ€™t remember. Only, you know, itâ€™ll be better, ever so much better, if
939987 [26840] Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And thatâ€™s how it must have been, though
939987 [26841] I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and thatâ€™s
939987 [26842] better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed
939987 [26843] his father, I donâ€™t defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,
939987 [26844] and yet it would be better if it were he, as youâ€™d have nothing to cry
939987 [26845] over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was
939987 [26846] conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit himâ€”thatâ€™s
939987 [26847] so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew
939987 [26848] nothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time. And when I
939987 [26849] heard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at
939987 [26850] once. And if he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts
939987 [26851] to dinner with me, and Iâ€™ll have a party of friends, and weâ€™ll drink to
939987 [26852] the reformed law courts. I donâ€™t believe heâ€™d be dangerous; besides, Iâ€™ll
939987 [26853] invite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did
939987 [26854] anything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in
939987 [26855] another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best
939987 [26856] judges. And, besides, who isnâ€™t suffering from aberration nowadays?â€”you,
939987 [26857] I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so many
939987 [26858] examples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him,
939987 [26859] he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one
939987 [26860] blames him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The
939987 [26861] doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my Lise is in a
939987 [26862] state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday, and the day before,
939987 [26863] too, and to-day I suddenly realized that itâ€™s all due to aberration. Oh,
939987 [26864] Lise grieves me so! I believe sheâ€™s quite mad. Why did she send for you?
939987 [26865] Did she send for you or did you come of yourself?â€
939987 [26866] 
939987 [26867] â€œYes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.â€ Alyosha got up
939987 [26868] resolutely.
939987 [26869] 
939987 [26870] â€œOh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps thatâ€™s whatâ€™s most
939987 [26871] important,â€ Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. â€œGod
939987 [26872] knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and itâ€™s no matter her
939987 [26873] sending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me, I
939987 [26874] canâ€™t trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,
939987 [26875] though I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only fancy,
939987 [26876] heâ€™s been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!â€
939987 [26877] 
939987 [26878] â€œHow? What? When?â€ Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat down
939987 [26879] again and listened standing.
939987 [26880] 
939987 [26881] â€œI will tell you; thatâ€™s perhaps why I asked you to come, for I donâ€™t know
939987 [26882] now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me
939987 [26883] twice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a friend to
939987 [26884] call on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came because he
939987 [26885] heard she was here. I didnâ€™t, of course, expect him to come often, knowing
939987 [26886] what a lot he has to do as it is, _vous comprenez, cette affaire et la
939987 [26887] mort terrible de votre papa_. But I suddenly heard heâ€™d been here again,
939987 [26888] not to see me but to see Lise. Thatâ€™s six days ago now. He came, stayed
939987 [26889] five minutes, and went away. And I didnâ€™t hear of it till three days
939987 [26890] afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for Lise
939987 [26891] directly. She laughed. â€˜He thought you were asleep,â€™ she said, â€˜and came
939987 [26892] in to me to ask after your health.â€™ Of course, thatâ€™s how it happened. But
939987 [26893] Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me! Would you believe it, one
939987 [26894] night, four days ago, just after you saw her last time, and had gone away,
939987 [26895] she suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never
939987 [26896] have hysterics? Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the
939987 [26897] third, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly
939987 [26898] screamed out, â€˜I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting
939987 [26899] him come to the house again.â€™ I was struck dumb at these amazing words,
939987 [26900] and answered, â€˜On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent
939987 [26901] young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?â€™â€”for all
939987 [26902] this business is a misfortune, isnâ€™t it? She suddenly burst out laughing
939987 [26903] at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I had
939987 [26904] amused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse
939987 [26905] to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without
939987 [26906] my knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early this
939987 [26907] morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you
939987 [26908] believe it, slapped her in the face. Thatâ€™s monstrous; I am always polite
939987 [26909] to my servants. And an hour later she was hugging Yuliaâ€™s feet and kissing
939987 [26910] them. She sent a message to me that she wasnâ€™t coming to me at all, and
939987 [26911] would never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her,
939987 [26912] she rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of
939987 [26913] the room without saying a word, so I couldnâ€™t find out what was the
939987 [26914] matter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of
939987 [26915] course, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and
939987 [26916] find out everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell
939987 [26917] meâ€”me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply
939987 [26918] the death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no
939987 [26919] more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then
939987 [26920] something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!â€ cried
939987 [26921] Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. â€œYou
939987 [26922] are late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense.
939987 [26923] What does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?â€
939987 [26924] 
939987 [26925] â€œTo Lise.â€
939987 [26926] 
939987 [26927] â€œOh, yes. You wonâ€™t forget, you wonâ€™t forget what I asked you? Itâ€™s a
939987 [26928] question of life and death!â€
939987 [26929] 
939987 [26930] â€œOf course, I wonâ€™t forget, if I can ... but I am so late,â€ muttered
939987 [26931] Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.
939987 [26932] 
939987 [26933] â€œNo, be sure, be sure to come in; donâ€™t say â€˜If you can.â€™ I shall die if
939987 [26934] you donâ€™t,â€ Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had already left
939987 [26935] the room.
939987 [26936] 
939987 [26937] 
939987 [26938] 
939987 [26939] Chapter III. A Little Demon
939987 [26940] 
939987 [26941] 
939987 [26942] Going in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair, in
939987 [26943] which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk. She did not move
939987 [26944] to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his face.
939987 [26945] There was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and yellow.
939987 [26946] Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three
939987 [26947] days. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand to him. He
939987 [26948] touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he
939987 [26949] sat down facing her, without a word.
939987 [26950] 
939987 [26951] â€œI know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,â€ Lise said curtly, â€œand
939987 [26952] mammaâ€™s kept you there for hours; sheâ€™s just been telling you about me and
939987 [26953] Yulia.â€
939987 [26954] 
939987 [26955] â€œHow do you know?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [26956] 
939987 [26957] â€œIâ€™ve been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do
939987 [26958] listen, thereâ€™s no harm in that. I donâ€™t apologize.â€
939987 [26959] 
939987 [26960] â€œYou are upset about something?â€
939987 [26961] 
939987 [26962] â€œOn the contrary, I am very happy. Iâ€™ve only just been reflecting for the
939987 [26963] thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your
939987 [26964] wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you and give you
939987 [26965] a note to take to the man I loved after you, youâ€™d take it and be sure to
939987 [26966] give it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you were forty, you would
939987 [26967] still go on taking my love-letters for me.â€
939987 [26968] 
939987 [26969] She suddenly laughed.
939987 [26970] 
939987 [26971] â€œThere is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,â€ Alyosha
939987 [26972] smiled to her.
939987 [26973] 
939987 [26974] â€œThe open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you.
939987 [26975] Whatâ€™s more, I donâ€™t want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.
939987 [26976] Alyosha, why is it I donâ€™t respect you? I am very fond of you, but I donâ€™t
939987 [26977] respect you. If I respected you, I shouldnâ€™t talk to you without shame,
939987 [26978] should I?â€
939987 [26979] 
939987 [26980] â€œNo.â€
939987 [26981] 
939987 [26982] â€œBut do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?â€
939987 [26983] 
939987 [26984] â€œNo, I donâ€™t believe it.â€
939987 [26985] 
939987 [26986] Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.
939987 [26987] 
939987 [26988] â€œI sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha,
939987 [26989] you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having so
939987 [26990] quickly allowed me not to love you.â€
939987 [26991] 
939987 [26992] â€œWhy did you send for me to-day, Lise?â€
939987 [26993] 
939987 [26994] â€œI wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to
939987 [26995] torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I donâ€™t
939987 [26996] want to be happy.â€
939987 [26997] 
939987 [26998] â€œYou are in love with disorder?â€
939987 [26999] 
939987 [27000] â€œYes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keep
939987 [27001] imagining how Iâ€™ll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it must
939987 [27002] be on the sly. Theyâ€™ll try to put it out, but itâ€™ll go on burning. And I
939987 [27003] shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I am!â€
939987 [27004] 
939987 [27005] She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.
939987 [27006] 
939987 [27007] â€œItâ€™s your luxurious life,â€ said Alyosha, softly.
939987 [27008] 
939987 [27009] â€œIs it better, then, to be poor?â€
939987 [27010] 
939987 [27011] â€œYes, it is better.â€
939987 [27012] 
939987 [27013] â€œThatâ€™s what your monk taught you. Thatâ€™s not true. Let me be rich and all
939987 [27014] the rest poor, Iâ€™ll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one
939987 [27015] else. Ach, donâ€™t speak, donâ€™t say anything,â€ she shook her hand at him,
939987 [27016] though Alyosha had not opened his mouth. â€œYouâ€™ve told me all that before,
939987 [27017] I know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder
939987 [27018] somebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhapsâ€”why do
939987 [27019] nothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? Iâ€™ll marry
939987 [27020] you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; weâ€™ll keep a colt,
939987 [27021] shall we? Do you know Kalganov?â€
939987 [27022] 
939987 [27023] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27024] 
939987 [27025] â€œHe is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, â€˜Why live in real life?
939987 [27026] Itâ€™s better to dream. One can dream the most delightful things, but real
939987 [27027] life is a bore.â€™ But heâ€™ll be married soon for all that; heâ€™s been making
939987 [27028] love to me already. Can you spin tops?â€
939987 [27029] 
939987 [27030] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27031] 
939987 [27032] â€œWell, heâ€™s just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning and
939987 [27033] then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, Iâ€™ll keep
939987 [27034] him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?â€
939987 [27035] 
939987 [27036] â€œNo.â€
939987 [27037] 
939987 [27038] â€œYou are awfully cross, because I donâ€™t talk about holy things. I donâ€™t
939987 [27039] want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the
939987 [27040] greatest sin? You must know all about that.â€
939987 [27041] 
939987 [27042] â€œGod will censure you.â€ Alyosha was watching her steadily.
939987 [27043] 
939987 [27044] â€œThatâ€™s just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure me,
939987 [27045] and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like to
939987 [27046] set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still donâ€™t believe me?â€
939987 [27047] 
939987 [27048] â€œWhy? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set
939987 [27049] fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. Itâ€™s a sort of
939987 [27050] disease.â€
939987 [27051] 
939987 [27052] â€œThatâ€™s not true, thatâ€™s not true; there may be children, but thatâ€™s not
939987 [27053] what I mean.â€
939987 [27054] 
939987 [27055] â€œYou take evil for good; itâ€™s a passing crisis, itâ€™s the result of your
939987 [27056] illness, perhaps.â€
939987 [27057] 
939987 [27058] â€œYou do despise me, though! Itâ€™s simply that I donâ€™t want to do good, I
939987 [27059] want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.â€
939987 [27060] 
939987 [27061] â€œWhy do evil?â€
939987 [27062] 
939987 [27063] â€œSo that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be if
939987 [27064] everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing a
939987 [27065] fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a long
939987 [27066] while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every one will
939987 [27067] stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all.
939987 [27068] That would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?â€
939987 [27069] 
939987 [27070] â€œI donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, to
939987 [27071] set fire to something. It happens sometimes.â€
939987 [27072] 
939987 [27073] â€œI not only say it, I shall do it.â€
939987 [27074] 
939987 [27075] â€œI believe you.â€
939987 [27076] 
939987 [27077] â€œAh, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying one
939987 [27078] little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to
939987 [27079] annoy you?â€
939987 [27080] 
939987 [27081] â€œNo, I donâ€™t think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do
939987 [27082] that in it, too.â€
939987 [27083] 
939987 [27084] â€œThere is a little. I never can tell lies to you,â€ she declared, with a
939987 [27085] strange fire in her eyes.
939987 [27086] 
939987 [27087] What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not a
939987 [27088] trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun and
939987 [27089] gayety never deserted her even at her most â€œearnestâ€ moments.
939987 [27090] 
939987 [27091] â€œThere are moments when people love crime,â€ said Alyosha thoughtfully.
939987 [27092] 
939987 [27093] â€œYes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves
939987 [27094] crime, they love it always, not at some â€˜moments.â€™ You know, itâ€™s as
939987 [27095] though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about
939987 [27096] it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all
939987 [27097] love it.â€
939987 [27098] 
939987 [27099] â€œAnd are you still reading nasty books?â€
939987 [27100] 
939987 [27101] â€œYes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal
939987 [27102] them.â€
939987 [27103] 
939987 [27104] â€œArenâ€™t you ashamed to destroy yourself?â€
939987 [27105] 
939987 [27106] â€œI want to destroy myself. Thereâ€™s a boy here, who lay down between the
939987 [27107] railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, your
939987 [27108] brother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves
939987 [27109] his having killed his father.â€
939987 [27110] 
939987 [27111] â€œLoves his having killed his father?â€
939987 [27112] 
939987 [27113] â€œYes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says itâ€™s so awful, but
939987 [27114] secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.â€
939987 [27115] 
939987 [27116] â€œThere is some truth in what you say about every one,â€ said Alyosha
939987 [27117] softly.
939987 [27118] 
939987 [27119] â€œOh, what ideas you have!â€ Lise shrieked in delight. â€œAnd you a monk, too!
939987 [27120] You wouldnâ€™t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies.
939987 [27121] Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils.
939987 [27122] Itâ€™s night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils
939987 [27123] all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the
939987 [27124] doors; thereâ€™s a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and
939987 [27125] seize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross
939987 [27126] myself and they all draw back, though they donâ€™t go away altogether, they
939987 [27127] stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have a
939987 [27128] frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come
939987 [27129] crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I cross myself
939987 [27130] again and they all draw back. Itâ€™s awful fun. it takes oneâ€™s breath away.â€
939987 [27131] 
939987 [27132] â€œIâ€™ve had the same dream, too,â€ said Alyosha suddenly.
939987 [27133] 
939987 [27134] â€œReally?â€ cried Lise, surprised. â€œI say, Alyosha, donâ€™t laugh, thatâ€™s
939987 [27135] awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?â€
939987 [27136] 
939987 [27137] â€œIt seems they can.â€
939987 [27138] 
939987 [27139] â€œAlyosha, I tell you, itâ€™s awfully important,â€ Lise went on, with really
939987 [27140] excessive amazement. â€œItâ€™s not the dream thatâ€™s important, but your having
939987 [27141] the same dream as me. You never lie to me, donâ€™t lie now: is it true? You
939987 [27142] are not laughing?â€
939987 [27143] 
939987 [27144] â€œItâ€™s true.â€
939987 [27145] 
939987 [27146] Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was
939987 [27147] silent.
939987 [27148] 
939987 [27149] â€œAlyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,â€ she said suddenly,
939987 [27150] in a supplicating voice.
939987 [27151] 
939987 [27152] â€œIâ€™ll always come to see you, all my life,â€ answered Alyosha firmly.
939987 [27153] 
939987 [27154] â€œYou are the only person I can talk to, you know,â€ Lise began again. â€œI
939987 [27155] talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to you
939987 [27156] more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a
939987 [27157] bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it
939987 [27158] true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?â€
939987 [27159] 
939987 [27160] â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
939987 [27161] 
939987 [27162] â€œThereâ€™s a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took a
939987 [27163] child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and then
939987 [27164] crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him, and
939987 [27165] afterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, within
939987 [27166] four hours. That was â€˜soonâ€™! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning and
939987 [27167] he stood admiring it. Thatâ€™s nice!â€
939987 [27168] 
939987 [27169] â€œNice?â€
939987 [27170] 
939987 [27171] â€œNice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hang
939987 [27172] there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple _compote_. I
939987 [27173] am awfully fond of pineapple _compote_. Do you like it?â€
939987 [27174] 
939987 [27175] Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly
939987 [27176] contorted, her eyes burned.
939987 [27177] 
939987 [27178] â€œYou know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I kept
939987 [27179] fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four years old
939987 [27180] understands, you know), and all the while the thought of pineapple
939987 [27181] _compote_ haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person,
939987 [27182] begging him _particularly_ to come and see me. He came and I suddenly told
939987 [27183] him all about the child and the pineapple _compote_. _All_ about it,
939987 [27184] _all_, and said that it was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice.
939987 [27185] Then he got up and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he
939987 [27186] despise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise
939987 [27187] me or not?â€ She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.
939987 [27188] 
939987 [27189] â€œTell me,â€ Alyosha asked anxiously, â€œdid you send for that person?â€
939987 [27190] 
939987 [27191] â€œYes, I did.â€
939987 [27192] 
939987 [27193] â€œDid you send him a letter?â€
939987 [27194] 
939987 [27195] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27196] 
939987 [27197] â€œSimply to ask about that, about that child?â€
939987 [27198] 
939987 [27199] â€œNo, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that at
939987 [27200] once. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.â€
939987 [27201] 
939987 [27202] â€œThat person behaved honorably,â€ Alyosha murmured.
939987 [27203] 
939987 [27204] â€œAnd did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?â€
939987 [27205] 
939987 [27206] â€œNo, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple _compote_ himself. He is
939987 [27207] very ill now, too, Lise.â€
939987 [27208] 
939987 [27209] â€œYes, he does believe in it,â€ said Lise, with flashing eyes.
939987 [27210] 
939987 [27211] â€œHe doesnâ€™t despise any one,â€ Alyosha went on. â€œOnly he does not believe
939987 [27212] any one. If he doesnâ€™t believe in people, of course, he does despise
939987 [27213] them.â€
939987 [27214] 
939987 [27215] â€œThen he despises me, me?â€
939987 [27216] 
939987 [27217] â€œYou, too.â€
939987 [27218] 
939987 [27219] â€œGood,â€ Lise seemed to grind her teeth. â€œWhen he went out laughing, I felt
939987 [27220] that it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is nice,
939987 [27221] and to be despised is nice....â€
939987 [27222] 
939987 [27223] And she laughed in Alyoshaâ€™s face, a feverish malicious laugh.
939987 [27224] 
939987 [27225] â€œDo you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should likeâ€”Alyosha, save me!â€ She
939987 [27226] suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with both
939987 [27227] hands. â€œSave me!â€ she almost groaned. â€œIs there any one in the world I
939987 [27228] could tell what Iâ€™ve told you? Iâ€™ve told you the truth, the truth. I shall
939987 [27229] kill myself, because I loathe everything! I donâ€™t want to live, because I
939987 [27230] loathe everything! I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why donâ€™t you
939987 [27231] love me in the least?â€ she finished in a frenzy.
939987 [27232] 
939987 [27233] â€œBut I do love you!â€ answered Alyosha warmly.
939987 [27234] 
939987 [27235] â€œAnd will you weep over me, will you?â€
939987 [27236] 
939987 [27237] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27238] 
939987 [27239] â€œNot because I wonâ€™t be your wife, but simply weep for me?â€
939987 [27240] 
939987 [27241] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27242] 
939987 [27243] â€œThank you! Itâ€™s only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me and
939987 [27244] trample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting _any one_. For
939987 [27245] I donâ€™t love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hate
939987 [27246] him! Go, Alyosha; itâ€™s time you went to your brotherâ€; she tore herself
939987 [27247] away from him suddenly.
939987 [27248] 
939987 [27249] â€œHow can I leave you like this?â€ said Alyosha, almost in alarm.
939987 [27250] 
939987 [27251] â€œGo to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, hereâ€™s your hat. Give my
939987 [27252] love to Mitya, go, go!â€
939987 [27253] 
939987 [27254] And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at her
939987 [27255] with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right
939987 [27256] hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it and
939987 [27257] instantly read the address, â€œTo Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.â€ He looked
939987 [27258] quickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.
939987 [27259] 
939987 [27260] â€œGive it to him, you must give it to him!â€ she ordered him, trembling and
939987 [27261] beside herself. â€œTo-day, at once, or Iâ€™ll poison myself! Thatâ€™s why I sent
939987 [27262] for you.â€
939987 [27263] 
939987 [27264] And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the note
939987 [27265] in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to Madame
939987 [27266] Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone, Lise
939987 [27267] unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack and
939987 [27268] slammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten seconds
939987 [27269] after, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat
939987 [27270] up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the
939987 [27271] blood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept
939987 [27272] whispering rapidly to herself:
939987 [27273] 
939987 [27274] â€œI am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!â€
939987 [27275] 
939987 [27276] 
939987 [27277] 
939987 [27278] Chapter IV. A Hymn And A Secret
939987 [27279] 
939987 [27280] 
939987 [27281] It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at the
939987 [27282] prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he would
939987 [27283] be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, as
939987 [27284] everywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminary
939987 [27285] inquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews
939987 [27286] with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities. But later,
939987 [27287] though the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at
939987 [27288] least, of Mityaâ€™s visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews with
939987 [27289] the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically
939987 [27290] _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_.
939987 [27291] 
939987 [27292] These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha and
939987 [27293] Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police, Mihail
939987 [27294] Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His abuse of her
939987 [27295] at Mokroe weighed on the old manâ€™s conscience, and when he learned the
939987 [27296] whole story, he completely changed his view of her. And strange to say,
939987 [27297] though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in
939987 [27298] prison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. â€œHe
939987 [27299] was a man of good heart, perhaps,â€ he thought, â€œwho had come to grief from
939987 [27300] drinking and dissipation.â€ His first horror had been succeeded by pity. As
939987 [27301] for Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for
939987 [27302] a long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to see
939987 [27303] the prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the â€œpolice
939987 [27304] captainâ€™s young ladies,â€ as he called them, and was always hanging about
939987 [27305] their house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,
939987 [27306] too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his duties, was a
939987 [27307] kind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long
939987 [27308] standing with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him,
939987 [27309] generally on sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in
939987 [27310] awe of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself;
939987 [27311] â€œself-taught,â€ of course. But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for
939987 [27312] him. During the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal
939987 [27313] Gospels, and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend.
939987 [27314] He used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours
939987 [27315] together with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the
939987 [27316] prison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made
939987 [27317] easy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had
939987 [27318] grown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so long
939987 [27319] as the authorities were satisfied.
939987 [27320] 
939987 [27321] When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to the
939987 [27322] place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came upon
939987 [27323] Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talking
939987 [27324] loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while Rakitin
939987 [27325] seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of
939987 [27326] late. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha
939987 [27327] enter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed
939987 [27328] in buttoning his big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at
939987 [27329] once for his umbrella.
939987 [27330] 
939987 [27331] â€œI must mind not to forget my belongings,â€ he muttered, simply to say
939987 [27332] something.
939987 [27333] 
939987 [27334] â€œMind you donâ€™t forget other peopleâ€™s belongings,â€ said Mitya, as a joke,
939987 [27335] and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.
939987 [27336] 
939987 [27337] â€œYouâ€™d better give that advice to your own family, whoâ€™ve always been a
939987 [27338] slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,â€ he cried, suddenly trembling with
939987 [27339] anger.
939987 [27340] 
939987 [27341] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter? I was joking,â€ cried Mitya. â€œDamn it all! They are all
939987 [27342] like that,â€ he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitinâ€™s hurriedly
939987 [27343] retreating figure. â€œHe was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all at
939987 [27344] once he boils up like that. He didnâ€™t even nod to you. Have you broken
939987 [27345] with him completely? Why are you so late? Iâ€™ve not been simply waiting,
939987 [27346] but thirsting for you the whole morning. But never mind. Weâ€™ll make up for
939987 [27347] it now.â€
939987 [27348] 
939987 [27349] â€œWhy does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?â€
939987 [27350] asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin had
939987 [27351] disappeared.
939987 [27352] 
939987 [27353] â€œGreat friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likelyâ€”a pig
939987 [27354] like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They canâ€™t understand a
939987 [27355] joke either, thatâ€™s the worst of such people. They never understand a
939987 [27356] joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prison
939987 [27357] walls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever fellow, very
939987 [27358] clever. Well, Alexey, itâ€™s all over with me now.â€
939987 [27359] 
939987 [27360] He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.
939987 [27361] 
939987 [27362] â€œYes, the trialâ€™s to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?â€ Alyosha said,
939987 [27363] with an apprehensive feeling.
939987 [27364] 
939987 [27365] â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ said Mitya, looking at him rather
939987 [27366] uncertainly. â€œOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now weâ€™ve been
939987 [27367] talking of things that donâ€™t matter, about this trial, but I havenâ€™t said
939987 [27368] a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but it
939987 [27369] wasnâ€™t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you
939987 [27370] look at me so critically?â€
939987 [27371] 
939987 [27372] â€œWhat do you mean, Mitya?â€
939987 [27373] 
939987 [27374] â€œIdeas, ideas, thatâ€™s all! Ethics! What is ethics?â€
939987 [27375] 
939987 [27376] â€œEthics?â€ asked Alyosha, wondering.
939987 [27377] 
939987 [27378] â€œYes; is it a science?â€
939987 [27379] 
939987 [27380] â€œYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I canâ€™t explain to you
939987 [27381] what sort of science it is.â€
939987 [27382] 
939987 [27383] â€œRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! Heâ€™s not going to be a
939987 [27384] monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There heâ€™ll go in for criticism of an
939987 [27385] elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career,
939987 [27386] too. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career! Damn
939987 [27387] ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than
939987 [27388] any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?â€
939987 [27389] 
939987 [27390] â€œKarl Bernard?â€ Alyosha was surprised again.
939987 [27391] 
939987 [27392] â€œNo, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he?
939987 [27393] Chemist or what?â€
939987 [27394] 
939987 [27395] â€œHe must be a savant,â€ answered Alyosha; â€œbut I confess I canâ€™t tell you
939987 [27396] much about him, either. Iâ€™ve heard of him as a savant, but what sort I
939987 [27397] donâ€™t know.â€
939987 [27398] 
939987 [27399] â€œWell, damn him, then! I donâ€™t know either,â€ swore Mitya. â€œA scoundrel of
939987 [27400] some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make his
939987 [27401] way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard. Ugh, these
939987 [27402] Bernards! They are all over the place.â€
939987 [27403] 
939987 [27404] â€œBut what is the matter?â€ Alyosha asked insistently.
939987 [27405] 
939987 [27406] â€œHe wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his
939987 [27407] literary career. Thatâ€™s what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants to
939987 [27408] prove some theory. He wants to say â€˜he couldnâ€™t help murdering his father,
939987 [27409] he was corrupted by his environment,â€™ and so on. He explained it all to
939987 [27410] me. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn
939987 [27411] the fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I donâ€™t care. He canâ€™t bear
939987 [27412] Ivan, he hates him. Heâ€™s not fond of you, either. But I donâ€™t turn him
939987 [27413] out, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him
939987 [27414] just now, â€˜The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for all
939987 [27415] true Russians are philosophers, and though youâ€™ve studied, you are not a
939987 [27416] philosopherâ€”you are a low fellow.â€™ He laughed, so maliciously. And I said
939987 [27417] to him, â€˜_De ideabus non est disputandum_.â€™ Isnâ€™t that rather good? I can
939987 [27418] set up for being a classic, you see!â€ Mitya laughed suddenly.
939987 [27419] 
939987 [27420] â€œWhy is it all over with you? You said so just now,â€ Alyosha interposed.
939987 [27421] 
939987 [27422] â€œWhy is it all over with me? Hâ€™m!... The fact of it is ... if you take it
939987 [27423] as a whole, I am sorry to lose Godâ€”thatâ€™s why it is.â€
939987 [27424] 
939987 [27425] â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜sorry to lose Godâ€™?â€
939987 [27426] 
939987 [27427] â€œImagine: inside, in the nerves, in the headâ€”that is, these nerves are
939987 [27428] there in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, the
939987 [27429] little tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ... that
939987 [27430] is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin
939987 [27431] quivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image
939987 [27432] appears ... it doesnâ€™t appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes
939987 [27433] ... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a momentâ€”devil
939987 [27434] take the moment!â€”but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it!
939987 [27435] Thatâ€™s why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at all
939987 [27436] because Iâ€™ve got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness.
939987 [27437] All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother,
939987 [27438] and it simply bowled me over. Itâ€™s magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A
939987 [27439] new manâ€™s arisingâ€”that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!â€
939987 [27440] 
939987 [27441] â€œWell, thatâ€™s a good thing, anyway,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [27442] 
939987 [27443] â€œThat I am sorry to lose God? Itâ€™s chemistry, brother, chemistry! Thereâ€™s
939987 [27444] no help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry. And
939987 [27445] Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesnâ€™t he dislike Him! Thatâ€™s the sore
939987 [27446] point with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend.
939987 [27447] â€˜Will you preach this in your reviews?â€™ I asked him. â€˜Oh, well, if I did
939987 [27448] it openly, they wonâ€™t let it through,â€™ he said. He laughed. â€˜But what will
939987 [27449] become of men then?â€™ I asked him, â€˜without God and immortal life? All
939987 [27450] things are lawful then, they can do what they like?â€™ â€˜Didnâ€™t you know?â€™ he
939987 [27451] said laughing, â€˜a clever man can do what he likes,â€™ he said. â€˜A clever man
939987 [27452] knows his way about, but youâ€™ve put your foot in it, committing a murder,
939987 [27453] and now you are rotting in prison.â€™ He says that to my face! A regular
939987 [27454] pig! I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a
939987 [27455] lot of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week.
939987 [27456] I copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.â€
939987 [27457] 
939987 [27458] Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:
939987 [27459] 
939987 [27460] â€œ â€˜In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to put
939987 [27461] oneâ€™s personality in contradiction to oneâ€™s reality.â€™ Do you understand
939987 [27462] that?â€
939987 [27463] 
939987 [27464] â€œNo, I donâ€™t,â€ said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him with
939987 [27465] curiosity.
939987 [27466] 
939987 [27467] â€œI donâ€™t understand either. Itâ€™s dark and obscure, but intellectual.
939987 [27468] â€˜Every one writes like that now,â€™ he says, â€˜itâ€™s the effect of their
939987 [27469] environment.â€™ They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry, too,
939987 [27470] the rascal. Heâ€™s written in honor of Madame Hohlakovâ€™s foot. Ha ha ha!â€
939987 [27471] 
939987 [27472] â€œIâ€™ve heard about it,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [27473] 
939987 [27474] â€œHave you? And have you heard the poem?â€
939987 [27475] 
939987 [27476] â€œNo.â€
939987 [27477] 
939987 [27478] â€œIâ€™ve got it. Here it is. Iâ€™ll read it to you. You donâ€™t knowâ€”I havenâ€™t
939987 [27479] told youâ€”thereâ€™s quite a story about it. Heâ€™s a rascal! Three weeks ago he
939987 [27480] began to tease me. â€˜Youâ€™ve got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the
939987 [27481] sake of three thousand, but Iâ€™m going to collar a hundred and fifty
939987 [27482] thousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.â€™ And
939987 [27483] he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She hadnâ€™t much brains in her
939987 [27484] youth, and now at forty she has lost what she had. â€˜But sheâ€™s awfully
939987 [27485] sentimental,â€™ he says; â€˜thatâ€™s how I shall get hold of her. When I marry
939987 [27486] her, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.â€™
939987 [27487] And his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for
939987 [27488] the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to see
939987 [27489] me every day. â€˜She is coming round,â€™ he declared. He was beaming with
939987 [27490] delight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house.
939987 [27491] Perhotinâ€™s carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly
939987 [27492] old noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had written this
939987 [27493] doggerel. â€˜Itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve soiled my hands with writing poetry,â€™
939987 [27494] he said. â€˜Itâ€™s to win her heart, so itâ€™s in a good cause. When I get hold
939987 [27495] of the silly womanâ€™s fortune, I can be of great social utility.â€™ They have
939987 [27496] this social justification for every nasty thing they do! â€˜Anyway itâ€™s
939987 [27497] better than your Pushkinâ€™s poetry,â€™ he said, â€˜for Iâ€™ve managed to advocate
939987 [27498] enlightenment even in that.â€™ I understand what he means about Pushkin, I
939987 [27499] quite see that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about
939987 [27500] womenâ€™s feet. But wasnâ€™t Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity
939987 [27501] of these fellows! â€˜On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object
939987 [27502] of my affectionsâ€™â€”he thought of that for a title. Heâ€™s a waggish fellow.
939987 [27503] 
939987 [27504] 
939987 [27505]     A captivating little foot,
939987 [27506]     Though swollen and red and tender!
939987 [27507]     The doctors come and plasters put,
939987 [27508]     But still they cannot mend her.
939987 [27509] 
939987 [27510]     Yet, â€™tis not for her foot I dreadâ€”
939987 [27511]     A theme for Pushkinâ€™s muse more fitâ€”
939987 [27512]     Itâ€™s not her foot, it is her head:
939987 [27513]     I tremble for her loss of wit!
939987 [27514] 
939987 [27515]     For as her foot swells, strange to say,
939987 [27516]     Her intellect is on the waneâ€”
939987 [27517]     Oh, for some remedy I pray
939987 [27518]     That may restore both foot and brain!
939987 [27519] 
939987 [27520] 
939987 [27521] He is a pig, a regular pig, but heâ€™s very arch, the rascal! And he really
939987 [27522] has put in a progressive idea. And wasnâ€™t he angry when she kicked him
939987 [27523] out! He was gnashing his teeth!â€
939987 [27524] 
939987 [27525] â€œHeâ€™s taken his revenge already,â€ said Alyosha. â€œHeâ€™s written a paragraph
939987 [27526] about Madame Hohlakov.â€
939987 [27527] 
939987 [27528] And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.
939987 [27529] 
939987 [27530] â€œThatâ€™s his doing, thatâ€™s his doing!â€ Mitya assented, frowning. â€œThatâ€™s
939987 [27531] him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been
939987 [27532] written about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... Hâ€™m!â€
939987 [27533] 
939987 [27534] He walked across the room with a harassed air.
939987 [27535] 
939987 [27536] â€œBrother, I cannot stay long,â€ Alyosha said, after a pause. â€œTo-morrow
939987 [27537] will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be
939987 [27538] accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I
939987 [27539] donâ€™t know what ...â€
939987 [27540] 
939987 [27541] â€œNo, donâ€™t be amazed at me,â€ Mitya broke in warmly. â€œAm I to talk of that
939987 [27542] stinking dog? Of the murderer? Weâ€™ve talked enough of him. I donâ€™t want to
939987 [27543] say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you
939987 [27544] will see. Hush!â€
939987 [27545] 
939987 [27546] He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.
939987 [27547] 
939987 [27548] â€œRakitin wouldnâ€™t understand it,â€ he began in a sort of exaltation; â€œbut
939987 [27549] you, youâ€™ll understand it all. Thatâ€™s why I was thirsting for you. You
939987 [27550] see, thereâ€™s so much Iâ€™ve been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here,
939987 [27551] within these peeling walls, but I havenâ€™t said a word about what matters
939987 [27552] most; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I
939987 [27553] must pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two months Iâ€™ve found
939987 [27554] in myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me,
939987 [27555] but would never have come to the surface, if it hadnâ€™t been for this blow
939987 [27556] from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years in
939987 [27557] the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of thatâ€”itâ€™s
939987 [27558] something else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me. Even
939987 [27559] there, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in another
939987 [27560] convict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even
939987 [27561] there one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen
939987 [27562] heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bring
939987 [27563] up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one
939987 [27564] may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them,
939987 [27565] hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamed
939987 [27566] of that â€˜babeâ€™ at such a moment? â€˜Why is the babe so poor?â€™ That was a
939987 [27567] sign to me at that moment. Itâ€™s for the babe Iâ€™m going. Because we are all
939987 [27568] responsible for all. For all the â€˜babes,â€™ for there are big children as
939987 [27569] well as little children. All are â€˜babes.â€™ I go for all, because some one
939987 [27570] must go for all. I didnâ€™t kill father, but Iâ€™ve got to go. I accept it.
939987 [27571] Itâ€™s all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are
939987 [27572] numbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their
939987 [27573] hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but
939987 [27574] then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man
939987 [27575] cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: itâ€™s His privilegeâ€”a grand
939987 [27576] one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground
939987 [27577] there without God? Rakitinâ€™s laughing! If they drive God from the earth,
939987 [27578] we shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison without God;
939987 [27579] itâ€™s even more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground
939987 [27580] will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whom
939987 [27581] is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!â€
939987 [27582] 
939987 [27583] Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. He
939987 [27584] turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
939987 [27585] 
939987 [27586] â€œYes, life is full, there is life even underground,â€ he began again. â€œYou
939987 [27587] wouldnâ€™t believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst for
939987 [27588] existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling
939987 [27589] walls. Rakitin doesnâ€™t understand that; all he cares about is building a
939987 [27590] house and letting flats. But Iâ€™ve been longing for you. And what is
939987 [27591] suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am
939987 [27592] not afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I
939987 [27593] wonâ€™t answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have such strength in
939987 [27594] me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be
939987 [27595] able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, â€˜I exist.â€™ In thousands
939987 [27596] of agoniesâ€”I exist. Iâ€™m tormented on the rackâ€”but I exist! Though I sit
939987 [27597] alone on a pillarâ€”I exist! I see the sun, and if I donâ€™t see the sun, I
939987 [27598] know itâ€™s there. And thereâ€™s a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun
939987 [27599] is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me.
939987 [27600] Damn them! Brother Ivanâ€”â€
939987 [27601] 
939987 [27602] â€œWhat of brother Ivan?â€ interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.
939987 [27603] 
939987 [27604] â€œYou see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden
939987 [27605] away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were
939987 [27606] surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was to
939987 [27607] stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not
939987 [27608] Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he is
939987 [27609] always silent. Itâ€™s God thatâ€™s worrying me. Thatâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s
939987 [27610] worrying me. What if He doesnâ€™t exist? What if Rakitinâ€™s rightâ€”that itâ€™s
939987 [27611] an idea made up by men? Then if He doesnâ€™t exist, man is the chief of the
939987 [27612] earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good
939987 [27613] without God? Thatâ€™s the question. I always come back to that. For whom is
939987 [27614] man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing
939987 [27615] the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without
939987 [27616] God. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I canâ€™t understand
939987 [27617] it. Lifeâ€™s easy for Rakitin. â€˜Youâ€™d better think about the extension of
939987 [27618] civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show
939987 [27619] your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by
939987 [27620] philosophy.â€™ I answered him, â€˜Well, but you, without a God, are more
939987 [27621] likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on
939987 [27622] every copeck.â€™ He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer
939987 [27623] me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a
939987 [27624] Chinaman, so itâ€™s a relative thing. Or isnâ€™t it? Is it not relative? A
939987 [27625] treacherous question! You wonâ€™t laugh if I tell you itâ€™s kept me awake two
939987 [27626] nights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.
939987 [27627] Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. Itâ€™s beyond me. But he is silent.
939987 [27628] I believe he is a free-mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to
939987 [27629] drink from the springs of his soulâ€”he was silent. But once he did drop a
939987 [27630] word.â€
939987 [27631] 
939987 [27632] â€œWhat did he say?â€ Alyosha took it up quickly.
939987 [27633] 
939987 [27634] â€œI said to him, â€˜Then everything is lawful, if it is so?â€™ He frowned.
939987 [27635] â€˜Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,â€™ he said, â€˜was a pig, but his ideas were
939987 [27636] right enough.â€™ That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That was
939987 [27637] going one better than Rakitin.â€
939987 [27638] 
939987 [27639] â€œYes,â€ Alyosha assented bitterly. â€œWhen was he with you?â€
939987 [27640] 
939987 [27641] â€œOf that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing
939987 [27642] about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business here
939987 [27643] is over and the verdict has been given, then Iâ€™ll tell you something. Iâ€™ll
939987 [27644] tell you everything. Weâ€™ve something tremendous on hand.... And you shall
939987 [27645] be my judge in it. But donâ€™t begin about that now; be silent. You talk of
939987 [27646] to-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about
939987 [27647] it.â€
939987 [27648] 
939987 [27649] â€œHave you talked to the counsel?â€
939987 [27650] 
939987 [27651] â€œWhatâ€™s the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. Heâ€™s a soft,
939987 [27652] city-bred rogueâ€”a Bernard! But he doesnâ€™t believe meâ€”not a bit of it. Only
939987 [27653] imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. â€˜In that case,â€™ I asked him, â€˜why
939987 [27654] have you come to defend me?â€™ Hang them all! Theyâ€™ve got a doctor down,
939987 [27655] too, want to prove Iâ€™m mad. I wonâ€™t have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to
939987 [27656] do her â€˜dutyâ€™ to the end, whatever the strain!â€ Mitya smiled bitterly.
939987 [27657] â€œThe cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe
939987 [27658] that she was a woman of â€˜great wrath.â€™ They repeated it. Yes, the facts
939987 [27659] against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks to
939987 [27660] his point. Grigoryâ€™s honest, but a fool. Many people are honest because
939987 [27661] they are fools: thatâ€™s Rakitinâ€™s idea. Grigoryâ€™s my enemy. And there are
939987 [27662] some people who are better as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [27663] I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground
939987 [27664] after that four thousand. Sheâ€™ll pay it back to the last farthing. I donâ€™t
939987 [27665] want her sacrifice; theyâ€™ll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I
939987 [27666] can stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the
939987 [27667] court, canâ€™t you? But damn it all, it doesnâ€™t matter! I shall get through
939987 [27668] somehow. I donâ€™t pity her. Itâ€™s her own doing. She deserves what she gets.
939987 [27669] I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.â€ He smiled bitterly again.
939987 [27670] â€œOnly ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such
939987 [27671] suffering to bear?â€ he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. â€œGrushaâ€™s killing
939987 [27672] me; the thought of herâ€™s killing me, killing me. She was with me just
939987 [27673] now....â€
939987 [27674] 
939987 [27675] â€œShe told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.â€
939987 [27676] 
939987 [27677] â€œI know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her as
939987 [27678] she was going. I didnâ€™t ask her forgiveness.â€
939987 [27679] 
939987 [27680] â€œWhy didnâ€™t you?â€ exclaimed Alyosha.
939987 [27681] 
939987 [27682] Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.
939987 [27683] 
939987 [27684] â€œGod preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault
939987 [27685] from a woman you love. From one you love especially, however greatly you
939987 [27686] may have been in fault. For a womanâ€”devil only knows what to make of a
939987 [27687] woman! I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are
939987 [27688] in fault to a woman. Say, â€˜I am sorry, forgive me,â€™ and a shower of
939987 [27689] reproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply and
939987 [27690] directly, sheâ€™ll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have
939987 [27691] never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her
939987 [27692] own, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it.
939987 [27693] Sheâ€™ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They are
939987 [27694] ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels
939987 [27695] without whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy,
939987 [27696] every decent man ought to be under some womanâ€™s thumb. Thatâ€™s my
939987 [27697] convictionâ€”not conviction, but feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and
939987 [27698] itâ€™s no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a CÃ¦sar! But
939987 [27699] donâ€™t ever beg her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule
939987 [27700] given you by your brother Mitya, whoâ€™s come to ruin through women. No, Iâ€™d
939987 [27701] better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship
939987 [27702] her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesnâ€™t see it. No, she still thinks I
939987 [27703] donâ€™t love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. The
939987 [27704] past was nothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers
939987 [27705] that tortured me, but now Iâ€™ve taken all her soul into my soul and through
939987 [27706] her Iâ€™ve become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they donâ€™t, I shall
939987 [27707] die of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you
939987 [27708] about me?â€
939987 [27709] 
939987 [27710] Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened,
939987 [27711] made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.
939987 [27712] 
939987 [27713] â€œThen she is not angry at my being jealous?â€ he exclaimed. â€œShe is a
939987 [27714] regular woman! â€˜Iâ€™ve a fierce heart myself!â€™ Ah, I love such fierce
939987 [27715] hearts, though I canâ€™t bear any oneâ€™s being jealous of me. I canâ€™t endure
939987 [27716] it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely.
939987 [27717] Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? Thatâ€™s the question. And
939987 [27718] without her I canâ€™t exist....â€
939987 [27719] 
939987 [27720] Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly
939987 [27721] seemed terribly worried.
939987 [27722] 
939987 [27723] â€œSo thereâ€™s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against
939987 [27724] her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka,
939987 [27725] thatâ€™s not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine
939987 [27726] way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! Iâ€™ll tell you our secret!â€
939987 [27727] 
939987 [27728] He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before
939987 [27729] him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one
939987 [27730] could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word
939987 [27731] could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.
939987 [27732] 
939987 [27733] â€œI will tell you all our secret,â€ Mitya whispered hurriedly. â€œI meant to
939987 [27734] tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are
939987 [27735] everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my
939987 [27736] angel. Itâ€™s your decision will decide it. Perhaps itâ€™s you that is
939987 [27737] superior and not Ivan. You see, itâ€™s a question of conscience, question of
939987 [27738] the higher conscienceâ€”the secret is so important that I canâ€™t settle it
939987 [27739] myself, and Iâ€™ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway itâ€™s too
939987 [27740] early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the
939987 [27741] verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Donâ€™t decide it now. Iâ€™ll tell
939987 [27742] you now. You listen, but donâ€™t decide. Stand and keep quiet. I wonâ€™t tell
939987 [27743] you everything. Iâ€™ll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep
939987 [27744] quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what
939987 [27745] shall I do with your eyes? Iâ€™m afraid your eyes will tell me your
939987 [27746] decision, even if you donâ€™t speak. Oo! Iâ€™m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan
939987 [27747] suggests my _escaping_. I wonâ€™t tell you the details: itâ€™s all been
939987 [27748] thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, donâ€™t decide. I should go to
939987 [27749] America with Grusha. You know I canâ€™t live without Grusha! What if they
939987 [27750] wonâ€™t let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan
939987 [27751] thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a
939987 [27752] hammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other
939987 [27753] hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has
939987 [27754] come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on
939987 [27755] it. Ivan says that in America, â€˜with the good-will,â€™ I can be of more use
939987 [27756] than underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? Whatâ€™s
939987 [27757] America? America is vanity again! And thereâ€™s a lot of swindling in
939987 [27758] America, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell
939987 [27759] you, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand
939987 [27760] this. Thereâ€™s no one else. Itâ€™s folly, madness to others, all Iâ€™ve told
939987 [27761] you of the hymn. Theyâ€™ll say Iâ€™m out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of
939987 [27762] my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He
939987 [27763] understands, only he doesnâ€™t answerâ€”he doesnâ€™t speak. He doesnâ€™t believe
939987 [27764] in the hymn. Donâ€™t speak, donâ€™t speak. I see how you look! You have
939987 [27765] already decided. Donâ€™t decide, spare me! I canâ€™t live without Grusha. Wait
939987 [27766] till after the trial!â€
939987 [27767] 
939987 [27768] Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on his
939987 [27769] shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brotherâ€™s.
939987 [27770] 
939987 [27771] â€œThey donâ€™t let convicts marry, do they?â€ he repeated for the third time
939987 [27772] in a supplicating voice.
939987 [27773] 
939987 [27774] Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
939987 [27775] 
939987 [27776] â€œTell me one thing,â€ he said. â€œIs Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was
939987 [27777] it?â€
939987 [27778] 
939987 [27779] â€œHis, his, and he is very keen on it. He didnâ€™t come to see me at first,
939987 [27780] then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away. He
939987 [27781] is awfully keen on it. He doesnâ€™t ask me, but orders me to escape. He
939987 [27782] doesnâ€™t doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my heart as I
939987 [27783] have to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me heâ€™d arrange it;
939987 [27784] heâ€™s found out about everything. But of that later. Heâ€™s simply set on it.
939987 [27785] Itâ€™s all a matter of money: heâ€™ll pay ten thousand for escape and give me
939987 [27786] twenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent
939987 [27787] escape for ten thousand.â€
939987 [27788] 
939987 [27789] â€œAnd he told you on no account to tell me?â€ Alyosha asked again.
939987 [27790] 
939987 [27791] â€œTo tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He is
939987 [27792] afraid, no doubt, that youâ€™ll stand before me as my conscience. Donâ€™t tell
939987 [27793] him I told you. Donâ€™t tell him, for anything.â€
939987 [27794] 
939987 [27795] â€œYou are right,â€ Alyosha pronounced; â€œitâ€™s impossible to decide anything
939987 [27796] before the trial is over. After the trial youâ€™ll decide of yourself. Then
939987 [27797] youâ€™ll find that new man in yourself and he will decide.â€
939987 [27798] 
939987 [27799] â€œA new man, or a Bernard whoâ€™ll decide _Ã  la_ Bernard, for I believe Iâ€™m a
939987 [27800] contemptible Bernard myself,â€ said Mitya, with a bitter grin.
939987 [27801] 
939987 [27802] â€œBut, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?â€
939987 [27803] 
939987 [27804] Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. â€œAlyosha,
939987 [27805] darling, itâ€™s time you were going,â€ he said, with a sudden haste. â€œThereâ€™s
939987 [27806] the superintendent shouting in the yard. Heâ€™ll be here directly. We are
939987 [27807] late; itâ€™s irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the cross,
939987 [27808] darling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow.â€
939987 [27809] 
939987 [27810] They embraced and kissed.
939987 [27811] 
939987 [27812] â€œIvan,â€ said Mitya suddenly, â€œsuggests my escaping; but, of course, he
939987 [27813] believes I did it.â€
939987 [27814] 
939987 [27815] A mournful smile came on to his lips.
939987 [27816] 
939987 [27817] â€œHave you asked him whether he believes it?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [27818] 
939987 [27819] â€œNo, I havenâ€™t. I wanted to, but I couldnâ€™t. I hadnâ€™t the courage. But I
939987 [27820] saw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!â€
939987 [27821] 
939987 [27822] Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when
939987 [27823] Mitya suddenly called him back.
939987 [27824] 
939987 [27825] â€œStand facing me! Thatâ€™s right!â€ And again he seized Alyosha, putting both
939987 [27826] hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it
939987 [27827] was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips
939987 [27828] twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.
939987 [27829] 
939987 [27830] â€œAlyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe
939987 [27831] I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, donâ€™t
939987 [27832] lie!â€ he cried desperately.
939987 [27833] 
939987 [27834] Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a
939987 [27835] stab at his heart.
939987 [27836] 
939987 [27837] â€œHush! What do you mean?â€ he faltered helplessly.
939987 [27838] 
939987 [27839] â€œThe whole truth, the whole, donâ€™t lie!â€ repeated Mitya.
939987 [27840] 
939987 [27841] â€œIâ€™ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!â€ broke in
939987 [27842] a shaking voice from Alyoshaâ€™s breast, and he raised his right hand in the
939987 [27843] air, as though calling God to witness his words.
939987 [27844] 
939987 [27845] Mityaâ€™s whole face was lighted up with bliss.
939987 [27846] 
939987 [27847] â€œThank you!â€ he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him
939987 [27848] after fainting. â€œNow you have given me new life. Would you believe it,
939987 [27849] till this moment Iâ€™ve been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go!
939987 [27850] Youâ€™ve given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along!
939987 [27851] Love Ivan!â€ was Mityaâ€™s last word.
939987 [27852] 
939987 [27853] Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of
939987 [27854] confidence even to him, to Alyoshaâ€”all this suddenly opened before Alyosha
939987 [27855] an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his
939987 [27856] unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly.
939987 [27857] There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. â€œLove Ivan!â€â€”he suddenly
939987 [27858] recalled Mityaâ€™s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see
939987 [27859] Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more
939987 [27860] than ever now.
939987 [27861] 
939987 [27862] 
939987 [27863] 
939987 [27864] Chapter V. Not You, Not You!
939987 [27865] 
939987 [27866] 
939987 [27867] On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was
939987 [27868] living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved
939987 [27869] to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now
939987 [27870] it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the
939987 [27871] terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted
939987 [27872] by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he
939987 [27873] recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina
939987 [27874] Ivanovna.
939987 [27875] 
939987 [27876] â€œAh, itâ€™s only you,â€ said Ivan dryly. â€œWell, good-by! You are going to
939987 [27877] her?â€
939987 [27878] 
939987 [27879] â€œYes.â€
939987 [27880] 
939987 [27881] â€œI donâ€™t advise you to; sheâ€™s upset and youâ€™ll upset her more.â€
939987 [27882] 
939987 [27883] A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:
939987 [27884] 
939987 [27885] â€œNo, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?â€
939987 [27886] 
939987 [27887] â€œYes, I have been with him.â€
939987 [27888] 
939987 [27889] â€œHas he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch,
939987 [27890] you must come back, you must. Do you hear?â€
939987 [27891] 
939987 [27892] There was such a peremptory note in Katyaâ€™s voice that Ivan, after a
939987 [27893] momentâ€™s hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.
939987 [27894] 
939987 [27895] â€œShe was listening,â€ he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it.
939987 [27896] 
939987 [27897] â€œExcuse my keeping my greatcoat on,â€ said Ivan, going into the
939987 [27898] drawing-room. â€œI wonâ€™t sit down. I wonâ€™t stay more than a minute.â€
939987 [27899] 
939987 [27900] â€œSit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ said Katerina Ivanovna, though she
939987 [27901] remained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but there
939987 [27902] was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that
939987 [27903] she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment.
939987 [27904] 
939987 [27905] â€œWhat did he ask you to tell me?â€
939987 [27906] 
939987 [27907] â€œOnly one thing,â€ said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, â€œthat
939987 [27908] you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of whatâ€ (he was a
939987 [27909] little confused) â€œ... passed between you ... at the time of your first
939987 [27910] acquaintance ... in that town.â€
939987 [27911] 
939987 [27912] â€œAh! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!â€ She broke into a
939987 [27913] bitter laugh. â€œWhy, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to
939987 [27914] spareâ€”whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!â€
939987 [27915] 
939987 [27916] Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.
939987 [27917] 
939987 [27918] â€œBoth yourself and him,â€ he answered softly.
939987 [27919] 
939987 [27920] â€œI am glad to hear it,â€ she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly
939987 [27921] blushed.
939987 [27922] 
939987 [27923] â€œYou donâ€™t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,â€ she said menacingly. â€œAnd I
939987 [27924] donâ€™t know myself yet. Perhaps youâ€™ll want to trample me under foot after
939987 [27925] my examination to-morrow.â€
939987 [27926] 
939987 [27927] â€œYou will give your evidence honorably,â€ said Alyosha; â€œthatâ€™s all thatâ€™s
939987 [27928] wanted.â€
939987 [27929] 
939987 [27930] â€œWomen are often dishonorable,â€ she snarled. â€œOnly an hour ago I was
939987 [27931] thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a
939987 [27932] reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Is
939987 [27933] he the murderer?â€ she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning
939987 [27934] quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question
939987 [27935] before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first
939987 [27936] time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.
939987 [27937] 
939987 [27938] â€œIâ€™ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he
939987 [27939] murdered his father. Itâ€™s only you I believed!â€ she continued, still
939987 [27940] addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at
939987 [27941] her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.
939987 [27942] 
939987 [27943] â€œWell, thatâ€™s enough, anyway,â€ Ivan cut short the conversation. â€œI am
939987 [27944] going. Iâ€™ll come to-morrow.â€ And turning at once, he walked out of the
939987 [27945] room and went straight downstairs.
939987 [27946] 
939987 [27947] With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands.
939987 [27948] 
939987 [27949] â€œFollow him! Overtake him! Donâ€™t leave him alone for a minute!â€ she said,
939987 [27950] in a hurried whisper. â€œHeâ€™s mad! Donâ€™t you know that heâ€™s mad? He is in a
939987 [27951] fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....â€
939987 [27952] 
939987 [27953] Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of
939987 [27954] him.
939987 [27955] 
939987 [27956] â€œWhat do you want?â€ He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was
939987 [27957] running after him. â€œShe told you to catch me up, because Iâ€™m mad. I know
939987 [27958] it all by heart,â€ he added irritably.
939987 [27959] 
939987 [27960] â€œShe is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,â€ said
939987 [27961] Alyosha. â€œI was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.â€
939987 [27962] 
939987 [27963] Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.
939987 [27964] 
939987 [27965] â€œAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their
939987 [27966] mind?â€ Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of
939987 [27967] irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.
939987 [27968] 
939987 [27969] â€œNo, I donâ€™t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.â€
939987 [27970] 
939987 [27971] â€œAnd can one observe that oneâ€™s going mad oneself?â€
939987 [27972] 
939987 [27973] â€œI imagine one canâ€™t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,â€ Alyosha
939987 [27974] answered with surprise.
939987 [27975] 
939987 [27976] Ivan paused for half a minute.
939987 [27977] 
939987 [27978] â€œIf you want to talk to me, please change the subject,â€ he said suddenly.
939987 [27979] 
939987 [27980] â€œOh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,â€ said Alyosha timidly,
939987 [27981] and he took Liseâ€™s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were
939987 [27982] just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.
939987 [27983] 
939987 [27984] â€œAh, from that little demon!â€ he laughed maliciously, and, without opening
939987 [27985] the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were
939987 [27986] scattered by the wind.
939987 [27987] 
939987 [27988] â€œSheâ€™s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,â€ he said
939987 [27989] contemptuously, striding along the street again.
939987 [27990] 
939987 [27991] â€œHow do you mean, offering herself?â€ exclaimed Alyosha.
939987 [27992] 
939987 [27993] â€œAs wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.â€
939987 [27994] 
939987 [27995] â€œHow can you, Ivan, how can you?â€ Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved
939987 [27996] voice. â€œShe is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is very
939987 [27997] ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped to
939987 [27998] hear something from you ... that would save her.â€
939987 [27999] 
939987 [28000] â€œYouâ€™ll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Be
939987 [28001] quiet, Alexey. Donâ€™t go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.â€
939987 [28002] 
939987 [28003] They were silent again for a moment.
939987 [28004] 
939987 [28005] â€œShe will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to
939987 [28006] act to-morrow at the trial,â€ he said sharply and angrily again.
939987 [28007] 
939987 [28008] â€œYou ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?â€
939987 [28009] 
939987 [28010] â€œYes. Whether sheâ€™s to save Mitya or ruin him. Sheâ€™ll pray for light from
939987 [28011] above. She canâ€™t make up her mind for herself, you see. She has not had
939987 [28012] time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants me to sing
939987 [28013] lullabies to her.â€
939987 [28014] 
939987 [28015] â€œKaterina Ivanovna loves you, brother,â€ said Alyosha sadly.
939987 [28016] 
939987 [28017] â€œPerhaps; but I am not very keen on her.â€
939987 [28018] 
939987 [28019] â€œShe is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give
939987 [28020] her hope?â€ Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. â€œI know that youâ€™ve given
939987 [28021] her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,â€ he added.
939987 [28022] 
939987 [28023] â€œI canâ€™t behave to her as I oughtâ€”break off altogether and tell her so
939987 [28024] straight out,â€ said Ivan, irritably. â€œI must wait till sentence is passed
939987 [28025] on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge herself on
939987 [28026] me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she hates him and
939987 [28027] knows she hates him. Itâ€™s all a lieâ€”lie upon lie! As long as I donâ€™t break
939987 [28028] off with her, she goes on hoping, and she wonâ€™t ruin that monster, knowing
939987 [28029] how I want to get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would
939987 [28030] come!â€
939987 [28031] 
939987 [28032] The words â€œmurdererâ€ and â€œmonsterâ€ echoed painfully in Alyoshaâ€™s heart.
939987 [28033] 
939987 [28034] â€œBut how can she ruin Mitya?â€ he asked, pondering on Ivanâ€™s words. â€œWhat
939987 [28035] evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?â€
939987 [28036] 
939987 [28037] â€œYou donâ€™t know that yet. Sheâ€™s got a document in her hands, in Mityaâ€™s
939987 [28038] own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor
939987 [28039] Pavlovitch.â€
939987 [28040] 
939987 [28041] â€œThatâ€™s impossible!â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [28042] 
939987 [28043] â€œWhy is it impossible? Iâ€™ve read it myself.â€
939987 [28044] 
939987 [28045] â€œThere canâ€™t be such a document!â€ Alyosha repeated warmly. â€œThere canâ€™t
939987 [28046] be, because heâ€™s not the murderer. Itâ€™s not he murdered father, not he!â€
939987 [28047] 
939987 [28048] Ivan suddenly stopped.
939987 [28049] 
939987 [28050] â€œWho is the murderer then, according to you?â€ he asked, with apparent
939987 [28051] coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.
939987 [28052] 
939987 [28053] â€œYou know who,â€ Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.
939987 [28054] 
939987 [28055] â€œWho? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,
939987 [28056] Smerdyakov?â€
939987 [28057] 
939987 [28058] Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.
939987 [28059] 
939987 [28060] â€œYou know who,â€ broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.
939987 [28061] 
939987 [28062] â€œWho? Who?â€ Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly
939987 [28063] vanished.
939987 [28064] 
939987 [28065] â€œI only know one thing,â€ Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, â€œ_it
939987 [28066] wasnâ€™t you_ killed father.â€
939987 [28067] 
939987 [28068] â€œ â€˜Not youâ€™! What do you mean by â€˜not youâ€™?â€ Ivan was thunderstruck.
939987 [28069] 
939987 [28070] â€œIt was not you killed father, not you!â€ Alyosha repeated firmly.
939987 [28071] 
939987 [28072] The silence lasted for half a minute.
939987 [28073] 
939987 [28074] â€œI know I didnâ€™t. Are you raving?â€ said Ivan, with a pale, distorted
939987 [28075] smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under a
939987 [28076] lamp-post.
939987 [28077] 
939987 [28078] â€œNo, Ivan. Youâ€™ve told yourself several times that you are the murderer.â€
939987 [28079] 
939987 [28080] â€œWhen did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?â€ Ivan
939987 [28081] faltered helplessly.
939987 [28082] 
939987 [28083] â€œYouâ€™ve said so to yourself many times, when youâ€™ve been alone during
939987 [28084] these two dreadful months,â€ Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as
939987 [28085] before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his
939987 [28086] own will, but obeying some irresistible command. â€œYou have accused
939987 [28087] yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no
939987 [28088] one else. But you didnâ€™t do it: you are mistaken: you are not the
939987 [28089] murderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.â€
939987 [28090] 
939987 [28091] They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They were
939987 [28092] both standing still, gazing into each otherâ€™s eyes. They were both pale.
939987 [28093] Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyoshaâ€™s shoulder.
939987 [28094] 
939987 [28095] â€œYouâ€™ve been in my room!â€ he whispered hoarsely. â€œYouâ€™ve been there at
939987 [28096] night, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?â€
939987 [28097] 
939987 [28098] â€œWhom do you meanâ€”Mitya?â€ Alyosha asked, bewildered.
939987 [28099] 
939987 [28100] â€œNot him, damn the monster!â€ Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. â€œDo you know that
939987 [28101] he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!â€
939987 [28102] 
939987 [28103] â€œWho is _he_! I donâ€™t know whom you are talking about,â€ Alyosha faltered,
939987 [28104] beginning to be alarmed.
939987 [28105] 
939987 [28106] â€œYes, you do know ... or how could youâ€”? Itâ€™s impossible that you donâ€™t
939987 [28107] know.â€
939987 [28108] 
939987 [28109] Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to reflect.
939987 [28110] A strange grin contorted his lips.
939987 [28111] 
939987 [28112] â€œBrother,â€ Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, â€œI have said this to
939987 [28113] you, because youâ€™ll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and for
939987 [28114] all, itâ€™s not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into my heart to
939987 [28115] say this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.â€
939987 [28116] 
939987 [28117] But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.
939987 [28118] 
939987 [28119] â€œAlexey Fyodorovitch,â€ he said, with a cold smile, â€œI canâ€™t endure
939987 [28120] prophets and epilepticsâ€”messengers from God especiallyâ€”and you know that
939987 [28121] only too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment and
939987 [28122] probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. Itâ€™s the way to
939987 [28123] your lodgings, too. Youâ€™d better be particularly careful not to come to me
939987 [28124] to-day! Do you hear?â€
939987 [28125] 
939987 [28126] He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.
939987 [28127] 
939987 [28128] â€œBrother,â€ Alyosha called after him, â€œif anything happens to you to-day,
939987 [28129] turn to me before any one!â€
939987 [28130] 
939987 [28131] But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross
939987 [28132] roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and walked
939987 [28133] slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neither
939987 [28134] of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s empty house. Alyosha
939987 [28135] had a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived some
939987 [28136] distance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge
939987 [28137] attached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of
939987 [28138] an official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who
939987 [28139] went to bed at six oâ€™clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.
939987 [28140] Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and very
939987 [28141] fond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one room he
939987 [28142] lived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode.
939987 [28143] 
939987 [28144] He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when he
939987 [28145] suddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.
939987 [28146] Suddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked with
939987 [28147] rapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half to a
939987 [28148] tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the
939987 [28149] neighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s kitchen for soup and to
939987 [28150] whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now
939987 [28151] lodging. She had sold their little house, and was now living here with her
939987 [28152] mother. Smerdyakov, who was illâ€”almost dyingâ€”had been with them ever since
939987 [28153] Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s death. It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by a
939987 [28154] sudden and irresistible prompting.
939987 [28155] 
939987 [28156] 
939987 [28157] 
939987 [28158] Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov
939987 [28159] 
939987 [28160] 
939987 [28161] This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his
939987 [28162] return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him was
939987 [28163] on the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, a
939987 [28164] fortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that it
939987 [28165] was now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard
939987 [28166] anything of him.
939987 [28167] 
939987 [28168] Ivan had only returned five days after his fatherâ€™s death, so that he was
939987 [28169] not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back.
939987 [28170] The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address,
939987 [28171] had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, not
939987 [28172] knowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning
939987 [28173] on Ivanâ€™s going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did
939987 [28174] not go to them till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram,
939987 [28175] he had, of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him
939987 [28176] was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to
939987 [28177] the general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion
939987 [28178] against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on,
939987 [28179] after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the
939987 [28180] details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised at
939987 [28181] Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly
939987 [28182] feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very
939987 [28183] fond.
939987 [28184] 
939987 [28185] By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivanâ€™s feeling to his brother
939987 [28186] Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassion
939987 [28187] for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance.
939987 [28188] Mityaâ€™s whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractive
939987 [28189] to him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s love for his
939987 [28190] brother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and
939987 [28191] that interview, far from shaking Ivanâ€™s belief in his guilt, positively
939987 [28192] strengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya
939987 [28193] had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violent
939987 [28194] language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked
939987 [28195] principally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had been
939987 [28196] â€œstolenâ€ from him by his father.
939987 [28197] 
939987 [28198] â€œThe money was mine, it was my money,â€ Mitya kept repeating. â€œEven if I
939987 [28199] had stolen it, I should have had the right.â€
939987 [28200] 
939987 [28201] He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a
939987 [28202] fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardly
939987 [28203] seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite the
939987 [28204] contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; he
939987 [28205] was continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughed
939987 [28206] contemptuously at Grigoryâ€™s evidence about the open door, and declared
939987 [28207] that it was â€œthe devil that opened it.â€ But he could not bring forward any
939987 [28208] coherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan
939987 [28209] during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for
939987 [28210] people who declared that â€œeverything was lawful,â€ to suspect and question
939987 [28211] him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.
939987 [28212] Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time
939987 [28213] to see Smerdyakov.
939987 [28214] 
939987 [28215] In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of
939987 [28216] Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he
939987 [28217] went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he
939987 [28218] gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the
939987 [28219] time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov,
939987 [28220] who was at that time in the hospital.
939987 [28221] 
939987 [28222] Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital,
939987 [28223] confidently asserted in reply to Ivanâ€™s persistent questions, that
939987 [28224] Smerdyakovâ€™s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised
939987 [28225] indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day
939987 [28226] of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an
939987 [28227] exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that
939987 [28228] the patientâ€™s life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after
939987 [28229] they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the
939987 [28230] patient would survive. â€œThough it might well be,â€ added Doctor
939987 [28231] Herzenstube, â€œthat his reason would be impaired for a considerable period,
939987 [28232] if not permanently.â€ On Ivanâ€™s asking impatiently whether that meant that
939987 [28233] he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full
939987 [28234] sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan
939987 [28235] decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.
939987 [28236] 
939987 [28237] At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov was
939987 [28238] lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was only one other bed in
939987 [28239] the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, who
939987 [28240] was obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to their
939987 [28241] conversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the
939987 [28242] first instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only
939987 [28243] momentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by
939987 [28244] Smerdyakovâ€™s composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he
939987 [28245] was very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his
939987 [28246] tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the
939987 [28247] interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining of headache
939987 [28248] and of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate face seemed to have
939987 [28249] become so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his crest of curls in front
939987 [28250] stood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye, which was screwed up and
939987 [28251] seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged.
939987 [28252] â€œItâ€™s always worth while speaking to a clever man.â€ Ivan was reminded of
939987 [28253] that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with
939987 [28254] painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to
939987 [28255] speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.
939987 [28256] 
939987 [28257] â€œCan you talk to me?â€ asked Ivan. â€œI wonâ€™t tire you much.â€
939987 [28258] 
939987 [28259] â€œCertainly I can,â€ mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. â€œHas your honor
939987 [28260] been back long?â€ he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous
939987 [28261] visitor.
939987 [28262] 
939987 [28263] â€œI only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.â€ Smerdyakov
939987 [28264] sighed.
939987 [28265] 
939987 [28266] â€œWhy do you sigh? You knew of it all along,â€ Ivan blurted out.
939987 [28267] 
939987 [28268] Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.
939987 [28269] 
939987 [28270] â€œHow could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell
939987 [28271] it would turn out like that?â€
939987 [28272] 
939987 [28273] â€œWhat would turn out? Donâ€™t prevaricate! Youâ€™ve foretold youâ€™d have a fit;
939987 [28274] on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.â€
939987 [28275] 
939987 [28276] â€œHave you said so at the examination yet?â€ Smerdyakov queried with
939987 [28277] composure.
939987 [28278] 
939987 [28279] Ivan felt suddenly angry.
939987 [28280] 
939987 [28281] â€œNo, I havenâ€™t yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great deal
939987 [28282] to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with
939987 [28283] me!â€
939987 [28284] 
939987 [28285] â€œWhy should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God
939987 [28286] Almighty?â€ said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment
939987 [28287] closing his eyes.
939987 [28288] 
939987 [28289] â€œIn the first place,â€ began Ivan, â€œI know that epileptic fits canâ€™t be
939987 [28290] told beforehand. Iâ€™ve inquired; donâ€™t try and take me in. You canâ€™t
939987 [28291] foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour
939987 [28292] beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you would
939987 [28293] fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didnâ€™t sham a fit on
939987 [28294] purpose?â€
939987 [28295] 
939987 [28296] â€œI had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,â€
939987 [28297] Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. â€œI fell from the garret just in the same
939987 [28298] way a year ago. Itâ€™s quite true you canâ€™t tell the day and hour of a fit
939987 [28299] beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.â€
939987 [28300] 
939987 [28301] â€œBut you did foretell the day and the hour!â€
939987 [28302] 
939987 [28303] â€œIn regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctors
939987 [28304] here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; itâ€™s no use my
939987 [28305] saying any more about it.â€
939987 [28306] 
939987 [28307] â€œAnd the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?â€
939987 [28308] 
939987 [28309] â€œYou donâ€™t seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to the
939987 [28310] cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most was
939987 [28311] losing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I went down
939987 [28312] into the cellar thinking, â€˜Here, itâ€™ll come on directly, itâ€™ll strike me
939987 [28313] down directly, shall I fall?â€™ And it was through this fear that I suddenly
939987 [28314] felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying. All that and
939987 [28315] all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when
939987 [28316] I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that
939987 [28317] to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer,
939987 [28318] and itâ€™s all been written down in the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr.
939987 [28319] Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it
939987 [28320] brought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that
939987 [28321] the fit seized me. And so theyâ€™ve written it down, that itâ€™s just how it
939987 [28322] must have happened, simply from my fear.â€
939987 [28323] 
939987 [28324] As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.
939987 [28325] 
939987 [28326] â€œThen you have said all that in your evidence?â€ said Ivan, somewhat taken
939987 [28327] aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their
939987 [28328] conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all
939987 [28329] himself.
939987 [28330] 
939987 [28331] â€œWhat have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,â€
939987 [28332] Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.
939987 [28333] 
939987 [28334] â€œAnd have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?â€
939987 [28335] 
939987 [28336] â€œNo, not to say every word.â€
939987 [28337] 
939987 [28338] â€œAnd did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?â€
939987 [28339] 
939987 [28340] â€œNo, I didnâ€™t tell them that either.â€
939987 [28341] 
939987 [28342] â€œTell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?â€
939987 [28343] 
939987 [28344] â€œI was afraid youâ€™d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.â€
939987 [28345] 
939987 [28346] â€œYou are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get
939987 [28347] out of the way of trouble.â€
939987 [28348] 
939987 [28349] â€œThat was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,
939987 [28350] foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare
939987 [28351] myself even more. Thatâ€™s why I told you to get out of harmâ€™s way, that you
939987 [28352] might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would
939987 [28353] remain at home to protect your father.â€
939987 [28354] 
939987 [28355] â€œYou might have said it more directly, you blockhead!â€ Ivan suddenly fired
939987 [28356] up.
939987 [28357] 
939987 [28358] â€œHow could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that
939987 [28359] made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have been
939987 [28360] apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away
939987 [28361] that money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tell
939987 [28362] that it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he would only
939987 [28363] carry off the three thousand that lay under the masterâ€™s mattress in the
939987 [28364] envelope, and you see, heâ€™s murdered him. How could you guess it either,
939987 [28365] sir?â€
939987 [28366] 
939987 [28367] â€œBut if you say yourself that it couldnâ€™t be guessed, how could I have
939987 [28368] guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!â€ said Ivan,
939987 [28369] pondering.
939987 [28370] 
939987 [28371] â€œYou might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to
939987 [28372] Moscow.â€
939987 [28373] 
939987 [28374] â€œHow could I guess it from that?â€
939987 [28375] 
939987 [28376] Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.
939987 [28377] 
939987 [28378] â€œYou might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to
939987 [28379] Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for
939987 [28380] Moscowâ€™s a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not far
939987 [28381] off, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might have
939987 [28382] come to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitchâ€™s
939987 [28383] illness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those
939987 [28384] knocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that
939987 [28385] Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would
939987 [28386] guess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so wouldnâ€™t go
939987 [28387] to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.â€
939987 [28388] 
939987 [28389] â€œHe talks very coherently,â€ thought Ivan, â€œthough he does mumble; whatâ€™s
939987 [28390] the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?â€
939987 [28391] 
939987 [28392] â€œYou are cunning with me, damn you!â€ he exclaimed, getting angry.
939987 [28393] 
939987 [28394] â€œBut I thought at the time that you quite guessed,â€ Smerdyakov parried
939987 [28395] with the simplest air.
939987 [28396] 
939987 [28397] â€œIf Iâ€™d guessed, I should have stayed,â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [28398] 
939987 [28399] â€œWhy, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in
939987 [28400] such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save
939987 [28401] yourself in your fright.â€
939987 [28402] 
939987 [28403] â€œYou think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?â€
939987 [28404] 
939987 [28405] â€œForgive me, I thought you were like me.â€
939987 [28406] 
939987 [28407] â€œOf course, I ought to have guessed,â€ Ivan said in agitation; â€œand I did
939987 [28408] guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying,
939987 [28409] you are lying again,â€ he cried, suddenly recollecting. â€œDo you remember
939987 [28410] how you went up to the carriage and said to me, â€˜Itâ€™s always worth while
939987 [28411] speaking to a clever manâ€™? So you were glad I went away, since you praised
939987 [28412] me?â€
939987 [28413] 
939987 [28414] Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.
939987 [28415] 
939987 [28416] â€œIf I was pleased,â€ he articulated rather breathlessly, â€œit was simply
939987 [28417] because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it was
939987 [28418] nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way of
939987 [28419] praise, but of reproach. You didnâ€™t understand it.â€
939987 [28420] 
939987 [28421] â€œWhat reproach?â€
939987 [28422] 
939987 [28423] â€œWhy, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and
939987 [28424] would not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealing
939987 [28425] that three thousand.â€
939987 [28426] 
939987 [28427] â€œDamn you!â€ Ivan swore again. â€œStay, did you tell the prosecutor and the
939987 [28428] investigating lawyer about those knocks?â€
939987 [28429] 
939987 [28430] â€œI told them everything just as it was.â€
939987 [28431] 
939987 [28432] Ivan wondered inwardly again.
939987 [28433] 
939987 [28434] â€œIf I thought of anything then,â€ he began again, â€œit was solely of some
939987 [28435] wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would stealâ€”I
939987 [28436] did not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness from
939987 [28437] you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that
939987 [28438] for?â€
939987 [28439] 
939987 [28440] â€œIt was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on
939987 [28441] purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just
939987 [28442] foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.â€
939987 [28443] 
939987 [28444] â€œMy brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.â€
939987 [28445] 
939987 [28446] â€œWhat else is left for him to do?â€ said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.
939987 [28447] â€œAnd who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory
939987 [28448] Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never
939987 [28449] mind him! He is trembling to save himself.â€
939987 [28450] 
939987 [28451] He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added:
939987 [28452] 
939987 [28453] â€œAnd look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is
939987 [28454] the work of my handsâ€”Iâ€™ve heard that already. But as to my being clever at
939987 [28455] shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one,
939987 [28456] if I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been
939987 [28457] planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such
939987 [28458] evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is
939987 [28459] that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one
939987 [28460] hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to
939987 [28461] tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me
939987 [28462] completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if
939987 [28463] he is so open-hearted beforehand? Any one can see that.â€
939987 [28464] 
939987 [28465] â€œWell,â€ and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by
939987 [28466] Smerdyakovâ€™s last argument. â€œI donâ€™t suspect you at all, and I think itâ€™s
939987 [28467] absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you for
939987 [28468] setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but Iâ€™ll come again. Meanwhile,
939987 [28469] good-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?â€
939987 [28470] 
939987 [28471] â€œI am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me,
939987 [28472] and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good people
939987 [28473] visit me every day.â€
939987 [28474] 
939987 [28475] â€œGood-by. But I shanâ€™t say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and
939987 [28476] I donâ€™t advise you to, either,â€ something made Ivan say suddenly.
939987 [28477] 
939987 [28478] â€œI quite understand. And if you donâ€™t speak of that, I shall say nothing
939987 [28479] of that conversation of ours at the gate.â€
939987 [28480] 
939987 [28481] Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozen
939987 [28482] steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insulting
939987 [28483] significance in Smerdyakovâ€™s last words. He was almost on the point of
939987 [28484] turning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering,
939987 [28485] â€œNonsense!â€ he went out of the hospital.
939987 [28486] 
939987 [28487] His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not
939987 [28488] Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might have
939987 [28489] been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the reason
939987 [28490] for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his
939987 [28491] sensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something.
939987 [28492] In the following days he became convinced of Mityaâ€™s guilt, as he got to
939987 [28493] know all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people
939987 [28494] of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it
939987 [28495] was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at
939987 [28496] Plotnikovâ€™s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence
939987 [28497] seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of
939987 [28498] the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigoryâ€™s evidence as
939987 [28499] to the open door. Grigoryâ€™s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivanâ€™s questions,
939987 [28500] declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the
939987 [28501] partition wall. â€œHe was not three paces from our bed,â€ and that although
939987 [28502] she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, â€œHe
939987 [28503] was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.â€
939987 [28504] 
939987 [28505] Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was
939987 [28506] not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle
939987 [28507] smile.
939987 [28508] 
939987 [28509] â€œDo you know how he spends his time now?â€ he asked; â€œlearning lists of
939987 [28510] French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the
939987 [28511] French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he
939987 [28512] he!â€
939987 [28513] 
939987 [28514] Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without
939987 [28515] repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that
939987 [28516] Dmitri was not the murderer, and that â€œin all probabilityâ€ Smerdyakov was.
939987 [28517] Ivan always felt that Alyoshaâ€™s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so
939987 [28518] he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that
939987 [28519] Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he
939987 [28520] never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,
939987 [28521] struck Ivan particularly.
939987 [28522] 
939987 [28523] But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart
939987 [28524] from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to
939987 [28525] his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time
939987 [28526] to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivanâ€™s, which left its mark on
939987 [28527] all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another
939987 [28528] novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here
939987 [28529] that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as Iâ€™ve related
939987 [28530] already, told him, â€œI am not keen on her,â€ it was an absolute lie: he
939987 [28531] loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have
939987 [28532] murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by
939987 [28533] what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivanâ€™s return to meet him as
939987 [28534] her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings.
939987 [28535] And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently
939987 [28536] before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she
939987 [28537] considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not
939987 [28538] abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov
939987 [28539] violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She was
939987 [28540] continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted
939987 [28541] Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were
939987 [28542] numerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyosha
939987 [28543] â€œlies upon lies.â€ There was, of course, much that was false in it, and
939987 [28544] that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.
939987 [28545] 
939987 [28546] He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakovâ€™s existence, and yet,
939987 [28547] a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted by the
939987 [28548] same strange thoughts as before. Itâ€™s enough to say that he was
939987 [28549] continually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in Fyodor
939987 [28550] Pavlovitchâ€™s house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and
939987 [28551] listened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he recalled that
939987 [28552] afterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly so
939987 [28553] depressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to
939987 [28554] himself, â€œI am a scoundrelâ€? And now he almost fancied that these
939987 [28555] tormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so
939987 [28556] completely did they take possession of him again. It was just after
939987 [28557] fancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once,
939987 [28558] and put a question to him:
939987 [28559] 
939987 [28560] â€œDo you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and
939987 [28561] afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved â€˜the right to
939987 [28562] desireâ€™?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired fatherâ€™s death or
939987 [28563] not?â€
939987 [28564] 
939987 [28565] â€œI did think so,â€ answered Alyosha, softly.
939987 [28566] 
939987 [28567] â€œIt was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didnâ€™t you fancy
939987 [28568] then that what I wished was just that â€˜one reptile should devour anotherâ€™;
939987 [28569] that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ...
939987 [28570] and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?â€
939987 [28571] 
939987 [28572] Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brotherâ€™s face.
939987 [28573] 
939987 [28574] â€œSpeak!â€ cried Ivan, â€œI want above everything to know what you thought
939987 [28575] then. I want the truth, the truth!â€
939987 [28576] 
939987 [28577] He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.
939987 [28578] 
939987 [28579] â€œForgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,â€ whispered Alyosha, and
939987 [28580] he did not add one softening phrase.
939987 [28581] 
939987 [28582] â€œThanks,â€ snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way.
939987 [28583] From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and
939987 [28584] seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gave
939987 [28585] up going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had not
939987 [28586] gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.
939987 [28587] 
939987 [28588] 
939987 [28589] 
939987 [28590] Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov
939987 [28591] 
939987 [28592] 
939987 [28593] By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knew
939987 [28594] his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a
939987 [28595] passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother, and
939987 [28596] on the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them,
939987 [28597] whether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had
939987 [28598] come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevnaâ€™s betrothed, and was living
939987 [28599] there for a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and
939987 [28600] daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly
939987 [28601] superior to themselves.
939987 [28602] 
939987 [28603] Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the
939987 [28604] passage. By Marya Kondratyevnaâ€™s directions he went straight to the better
939987 [28605] room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in the
939987 [28606] room and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with blue paper, which
939987 [28607] was a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroaches
939987 [28608] swarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling from
939987 [28609] them. The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and two
939987 [28610] chairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with
939987 [28611] pink patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little
939987 [28612] windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table stood a
939987 [28613] little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But
939987 [28614] Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at the
939987 [28615] table on a bench. He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing
939987 [28616] with a pen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick,
939987 [28617] but with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakovâ€™s face that
939987 [28618] he had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,
939987 [28619] fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the
939987 [28620] sides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather
939987 [28621] dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which Ivan had
939987 [28622] never seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenly
939987 [28623] redoubled Ivanâ€™s anger: â€œA creature like that and wearing spectacles!â€
939987 [28624] 
939987 [28625] Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor
939987 [28626] through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from the
939987 [28627] bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least
939987 [28628] possible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly; he
939987 [28629] took it all in and noted it at onceâ€”most of all the look in Smerdyakovâ€™s
939987 [28630] eyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. â€œWhat do you want to
939987 [28631] intrude for?â€ it seemed to say; â€œwe settled everything then; why have you
939987 [28632] come again?â€ Ivan could scarcely control himself.
939987 [28633] 
939987 [28634] â€œItâ€™s hot here,â€ he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.
939987 [28635] 
939987 [28636] â€œTake off your coat,â€ Smerdyakov conceded.
939987 [28637] 
939987 [28638] Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He
939987 [28639] took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakov
939987 [28640] managed to sit down on his bench before him.
939987 [28641] 
939987 [28642] â€œTo begin with, are we alone?â€ Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. â€œCan
939987 [28643] they overhear us in there?â€
939987 [28644] 
939987 [28645] â€œNo one can hear anything. Youâ€™ve seen for yourself: thereâ€™s a passage.â€
939987 [28646] 
939987 [28647] â€œListen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving the
939987 [28648] hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, you
939987 [28649] wouldnâ€™t tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate?
939987 [28650] What do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by it? Were you threatening
939987 [28651] me? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am
939987 [28652] afraid of you?â€
939987 [28653] 
939987 [28654] Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obvious
939987 [28655] intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show
939987 [28656] his cards. Smerdyakovâ€™s eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye winked, and
939987 [28657] he at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and deliberation.
939987 [28658] â€œYou want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,â€
939987 [28659] he seemed to say.
939987 [28660] 
939987 [28661] â€œThis is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowing
939987 [28662] beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his fate, and
939987 [28663] that people mightnâ€™t after that conclude any evil about your feelings and
939987 [28664] perhaps of something else, tooâ€”thatâ€™s what I promised not to tell the
939987 [28665] authorities.â€
939987 [28666] 
939987 [28667] Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself,
939987 [28668] yet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic, resentful
939987 [28669] and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist passed before
939987 [28670] Ivanâ€™s eyes for the first moment.
939987 [28671] 
939987 [28672] â€œHow? What? Are you out of your mind?â€
939987 [28673] 
939987 [28674] â€œIâ€™m perfectly in possession of all my faculties.â€
939987 [28675] 
939987 [28676] â€œDo you suppose I _knew_ of the murder?â€ Ivan cried at last, and he
939987 [28677] brought his fist violently on the table. â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜something
939987 [28678] else, tooâ€™? Speak, scoundrel!â€
939987 [28679] 
939987 [28680] Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.
939987 [28681] 
939987 [28682] â€œSpeak, you stinking rogue, what is that â€˜something else, tooâ€™?â€
939987 [28683] 
939987 [28684] â€œThe â€˜something elseâ€™ I meant was that you probably, too, were very
939987 [28685] desirous of your parentâ€™s death.â€
939987 [28686] 
939987 [28687] Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so that
939987 [28688] he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed in tears.
939987 [28689] Saying, â€œItâ€™s a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,â€ he dried his eyes with
939987 [28690] a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minute
939987 [28691] passed.
939987 [28692] 
939987 [28693] â€œThatâ€™s enough! Leave off,â€ Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.
939987 [28694] â€œDonâ€™t put me out of all patience.â€
939987 [28695] 
939987 [28696] Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered face
939987 [28697] reflected the insult he had just received.
939987 [28698] 
939987 [28699] â€œSo you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant to
939987 [28700] kill my father?â€
939987 [28701] 
939987 [28702] â€œI didnâ€™t know what thoughts were in your mind then,â€ said Smerdyakov
939987 [28703] resentfully; â€œand so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that
939987 [28704] very point.â€
939987 [28705] 
939987 [28706] â€œTo sound what, what?â€
939987 [28707] 
939987 [28708] â€œWhy, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be
939987 [28709] murdered or not.â€
939987 [28710] 
939987 [28711] What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent tone
939987 [28712] to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.
939987 [28713] 
939987 [28714] â€œIt was you murdered him?â€ he cried suddenly.
939987 [28715] 
939987 [28716] Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
939987 [28717] 
939987 [28718] â€œYou know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasnâ€™t I murdered him. And I
939987 [28719] should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of
939987 [28720] it again.â€
939987 [28721] 
939987 [28722] â€œBut why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?â€
939987 [28723] 
939987 [28724] â€œAs you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a
939987 [28725] position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to
939987 [28726] sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then
939987 [28727] the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly,
939987 [28728] too.â€
939987 [28729] 
939987 [28730] â€œLook here, you didnâ€™t say that a fortnight ago.â€
939987 [28731] 
939987 [28732] â€œI meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought
939987 [28733] youâ€™d understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible man
939987 [28734] you wouldnâ€™t care to talk of it openly.â€
939987 [28735] 
939987 [28736] â€œWhat next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I
939987 [28737] have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?â€
939987 [28738] 
939987 [28739] â€œAs for the murder, you couldnâ€™t have done that and didnâ€™t want to, but as
939987 [28740] for wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.â€
939987 [28741] 
939987 [28742] â€œAnd how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it;
939987 [28743] what grounds had I for wanting it?â€
939987 [28744] 
939987 [28745] â€œWhat grounds had you? What about the inheritance?â€ said Smerdyakov
939987 [28746] sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. â€œWhy, after your parentâ€™s
939987 [28747] death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and very
939987 [28748] likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady,
939987 [28749] Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made over to her
939987 [28750] directly after the wedding, for sheâ€™s plenty of sense, so that your parent
939987 [28751] would not have left you two roubles between the three of you. And were
939987 [28752] they far from a wedding, either? Not a hairâ€™s-breadth: that lady had only
939987 [28753] to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with
939987 [28754] his tongue out.â€
939987 [28755] 
939987 [28756] Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
939987 [28757] 
939987 [28758] â€œVery good,â€ he commented at last. â€œYou see, I havenâ€™t jumped up, I
939987 [28759] havenâ€™t knocked you down, I havenâ€™t killed you. Speak on. So, according to
939987 [28760] you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?â€
939987 [28761] 
939987 [28762] â€œHow could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would lose
939987 [28763] all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go off to
939987 [28764] exile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother
939987 [28765] Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so youâ€™d each have not forty, but
939987 [28766] sixty thousand each. Thereâ€™s not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri
939987 [28767] Fyodorovitch.â€
939987 [28768] 
939987 [28769] â€œWhat I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on any
939987 [28770] one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I did
939987 [28771] expect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember my
939987 [28772] impression!â€
939987 [28773] 
939987 [28774] â€œI thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on me
939987 [28775] as well,â€ said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. â€œSo that it was just by
939987 [28776] that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. For if you
939987 [28777] had a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me,
939987 [28778] â€˜You can murder my parent, I wonâ€™t hinder you!â€™ â€
939987 [28779] 
939987 [28780] â€œYou scoundrel! So thatâ€™s how you understood it!â€
939987 [28781] 
939987 [28782] â€œIt was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go to
939987 [28783] Moscow and refused all your fatherâ€™s entreaties to go to Tchermashnyaâ€”and
939987 [28784] simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once! What reason had
939987 [28785] you to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to Tchermashnya with no
939987 [28786] reason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected something
939987 [28787] from me.â€
939987 [28788] 
939987 [28789] â€œNo, I swear I didnâ€™t!â€ shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.
939987 [28790] 
939987 [28791] â€œYou didnâ€™t? Then you ought, as your fatherâ€™s son, to have had me taken to
939987 [28792] the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, to
939987 [28793] have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bit
939987 [28794] angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish
939987 [28795] word and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayed
939987 [28796] to save your parentâ€™s life. How could I help drawing my conclusions?â€
939987 [28797] 
939987 [28798] Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.
939987 [28799] 
939987 [28800] â€œYes, I am sorry I didnâ€™t punch you in the face,â€ he said with a bitter
939987 [28801] smile. â€œI couldnâ€™t have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would have
939987 [28802] believed me and what charge could I bring against you? But the punch in
939987 [28803] the face ... oh, Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t think of it. Though blows are
939987 [28804] forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.â€
939987 [28805] 
939987 [28806] Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.
939987 [28807] 
939987 [28808] â€œIn the ordinary occasions of life,â€ he said in the same complacent and
939987 [28809] sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about
939987 [28810] religion at Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s table, â€œin the ordinary occasions of life,
939987 [28811] blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have given
939987 [28812] them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows,
939987 [28813] not only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republic
939987 [28814] of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave
939987 [28815] off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.â€
939987 [28816] 
939987 [28817] â€œWhat are you learning French words for?â€ Ivan nodded towards the
939987 [28818] exercise-book lying on the table.
939987 [28819] 
939987 [28820] â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that
939987 [28821] I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?â€
939987 [28822] 
939987 [28823] â€œListen, monster.â€ Ivanâ€™s eyes flashed and he trembled all over. â€œI am not
939987 [28824] afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I
939987 [28825] donâ€™t beat you to death, itâ€™s simply because I suspect you of that crime
939987 [28826] and Iâ€™ll drag you to justice. Iâ€™ll unmask you.â€
939987 [28827] 
939987 [28828] â€œTo my thinking, youâ€™d better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of,
939987 [28829] considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if you
939987 [28830] begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.â€
939987 [28831] 
939987 [28832] â€œDo you think I am afraid of you now?â€
939987 [28833] 
939987 [28834] â€œIf the court doesnâ€™t believe all Iâ€™ve said to you just now, the public
939987 [28835] will, and you will be ashamed.â€
939987 [28836] 
939987 [28837] â€œThatâ€™s as much as to say, â€˜Itâ€™s always worth while speaking to a sensible
939987 [28838] man,â€™ eh?â€ snarled Ivan.
939987 [28839] 
939987 [28840] â€œYou hit the mark, indeed. And youâ€™d better be sensible.â€
939987 [28841] 
939987 [28842] Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and
939987 [28843] without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him,
939987 [28844] walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him.
939987 [28845] There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations
939987 [28846] filled his soul. â€œShall I go at once and give information against
939987 [28847] Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On
939987 [28848] the contrary, heâ€™ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for
939987 [28849] Tchermashnya then? What for? What for?â€ Ivan asked himself. â€œYes, of
939987 [28850] course, I was expecting something and he is right....â€ And he remembered
939987 [28851] for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his fatherâ€™s house, he
939987 [28852] had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish
939987 [28853] that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. â€œYes, I
939987 [28854] expected it then, thatâ€™s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder!
939987 [28855] Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I donâ€™t
939987 [28856] dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!â€
939987 [28857] 
939987 [28858] Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed
939987 [28859] her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his
939987 [28860] conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldnâ€™t be calmed,
939987 [28861] however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room,
939987 [28862] speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on
939987 [28863] the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange
939987 [28864] sentence: â€œIf itâ€™s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov whoâ€™s the murderer, I share
939987 [28865] his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I donâ€™t know yet. But if
939987 [28866] he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer,
939987 [28867] too.â€
939987 [28868] 
939987 [28869] When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a
939987 [28870] word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out a
939987 [28871] sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which
939987 [28872] Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a â€œconclusive proofâ€ that Dmitri had
939987 [28873] killed his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [28874] when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on
939987 [28875] the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s, when
939987 [28876] Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed
939987 [28877] to Grushenka. I donâ€™t know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was
939987 [28878] at the â€œMetropolis,â€ where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen
939987 [28879] and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was
939987 [28880] a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was
939987 [28881] like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with
939987 [28882] extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has
939987 [28883] just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine
939987 [28884] fellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out;
939987 [28885] and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with
939987 [28886] drunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty
939987 [28887] piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the
939987 [28888] tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was
939987 [28889] evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only
939987 [28890] filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.
939987 [28891] The letter ran as follows:
939987 [28892] 
939987 [28893] 
939987 [28894]     FATAL KATYA: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three
939987 [28895]     thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my
939987 [28896]     love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it from
939987 [28897]     every one, and if I canâ€™t borrow it, I give you my word of honor I
939987 [28898]     shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from
939987 [28899]     under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to
939987 [28900]     Siberia for it, Iâ€™ll give you back your three thousand. And
939987 [28901]     farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for Iâ€™ve been a
939987 [28902]     scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, youâ€™ll be
939987 [28903]     happier and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love
939987 [28904]     another woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can
939987 [28905]     you forgive? I will murder the man whoâ€™s robbed me! Iâ€™ll leave you
939987 [28906]     all and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not _her_
939987 [28907]     either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!
939987 [28908] 
939987 [28909]     P.S.â€”I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. One
939987 [28910]     string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I
939987 [28911]     shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three
939987 [28912]     thousand from him and fling it to you. Though Iâ€™ve been a
939987 [28913]     scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand.
939987 [28914]     The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a
939987 [28915]     thief, but Iâ€™ll murder my thief. Katya, donâ€™t look disdainful.
939987 [28916]     Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father
939987 [28917]     and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your
939987 [28918]     pride. And he doesnâ€™t love you.
939987 [28919] 
939987 [28920]     P.P.S.â€”I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.â€”Katya, pray to God
939987 [28921]     that some oneâ€™ll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in
939987 [28922]     gore, and if no one doesâ€”I shall! Kill me!
939987 [28923] 
939987 [28924]     Your slave and enemy,
939987 [28925] 
939987 [28926]     D. KARAMAZOV.
939987 [28927] 
939987 [28928] 
939987 [28929] When Ivan read this â€œdocumentâ€ he was convinced. So then it was his
939987 [28930] brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This
939987 [28931] letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There
939987 [28932] could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mityaâ€™s guilt. The suspicion
939987 [28933] never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the
939987 [28934] murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not
939987 [28935] fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he
939987 [28936] only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later
939987 [28937] he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at
939987 [28938] his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him.
939987 [28939] So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice
939987 [28940] he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind.
939987 [28941] 
939987 [28942] â€œHeâ€™ll end in madness,â€ the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and
939987 [28943] Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself
939987 [28944] began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been
939987 [28945] sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time
939987 [28946] his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were
939987 [28947] like two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s â€œreturnsâ€
939987 [28948] to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his
939987 [28949] favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene
939987 [28950] described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan
939987 [28951] had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mityaâ€™s
939987 [28952] guilt, in spite of those â€œreturnsâ€ that were so hateful to him. It is
939987 [28953] remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more
939987 [28954] every day, he realized that it was not on account of Katyaâ€™s â€œreturnsâ€
939987 [28955] that he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_.
939987 [28956] He was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.
939987 [28957] 
939987 [28958] Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed
939987 [28959] to him a plan of escapeâ€”a plan he had obviously thought over a long time.
939987 [28960] He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart
939987 [28961] from a phrase of Smerdyakovâ€™s, that it was to his, Ivanâ€™s, advantage that
939987 [28962] his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance
939987 [28963] and Alyoshaâ€™s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to
939987 [28964] sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mityaâ€™s escape. On his return from
939987 [28965] seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel
939987 [28966] that he was anxious for Mityaâ€™s escape, not only to heal that sore place
939987 [28967] by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. â€œIs it because I
939987 [28968] am as much a murderer at heart?â€ he asked himself. Something very deep
939987 [28969] down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered
939987 [28970] cruelly all that month. But of that later....
939987 [28971] 
939987 [28972] When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his
939987 [28973] hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden
939987 [28974] and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina
939987 [28975] Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyoshaâ€™s presence: â€œIt was
939987 [28976] you, you, persuaded me of hisâ€ (that is, Mityaâ€™s) â€œguilt!â€ Ivan was
939987 [28977] thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her
939987 [28978] that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in
939987 [28979] her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_,
939987 [28980] she, who had produced that â€œdocumentâ€ and proved his brotherâ€™s guilt. And
939987 [28981] now she suddenly exclaimed: â€œIâ€™ve been at Smerdyakovâ€™s myself!â€ When had
939987 [28982] she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so
939987 [28983] sure of Mityaâ€™s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What,
939987 [28984] what, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could
939987 [28985] not understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words
939987 [28986] pass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and
939987 [28987] rushed off to Smerdyakov. â€œI shall kill him, perhaps, this time,â€ he
939987 [28988] thought on the way.
939987 [28989] 
939987 [28990] 
939987 [28991] 
939987 [28992] Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov
939987 [28993] 
939987 [28994] 
939987 [28995] When he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing early
939987 [28996] that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly. It did
939987 [28997] not lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the wind, and soon there
939987 [28998] was a regular snowstorm. There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of
939987 [28999] the town where Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness,
939987 [29000] unconscious of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head
939987 [29001] ached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his
939987 [29002] hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevnaâ€™s
939987 [29003] cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant. He was
939987 [29004] wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was walking in zigzags, grumbling
939987 [29005] and swearing to himself. Then suddenly he would begin singing in a husky
939987 [29006] drunken voice:
939987 [29007] 
939987 [29008] 
939987 [29009]     â€œAch, Vankaâ€™s gone to Petersburg;
939987 [29010]     I wonâ€™t wait till he comes back.â€
939987 [29011] 
939987 [29012] 
939987 [29013] But he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again;
939987 [29014] then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an intense hatred for
939987 [29015] him before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he realized his
939987 [29016] presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down. At that
939987 [29017] moment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt
939987 [29018] against Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. The peasant went flying
939987 [29019] backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground. He uttered one
939987 [29020] plaintive â€œOâ€”oh!â€ and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was
939987 [29021] lying on his back, without movement or consciousness. â€œHe will be frozen,â€
939987 [29022] thought Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakovâ€™s.
939987 [29023] 
939987 [29024] In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with a
939987 [29025] candle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, â€œItâ€™s not that
939987 [29026] heâ€™s laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even told us to take the
939987 [29027] tea away; he wouldnâ€™t have any.â€
939987 [29028] 
939987 [29029] â€œWhy, does he make a row?â€ asked Ivan coarsely.
939987 [29030] 
939987 [29031] â€œOh, dear, no, quite the contrary, heâ€™s very quiet. Only please donâ€™t talk
939987 [29032] to him too long,â€ Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan opened the door and
939987 [29033] stepped into the room.
939987 [29034] 
939987 [29035] It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room. One of
939987 [29036] the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been put a
939987 [29037] large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up, with
939987 [29038] fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearing
939987 [29039] the same dressing-gown. The table had been brought out in front of the
939987 [29040] sofa, so that there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a thick book
939987 [29041] in yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be
939987 [29042] sitting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was
939987 [29043] apparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in
939987 [29044] his face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and there
939987 [29045] were blue marks under them.
939987 [29046] 
939987 [29047] â€œWhy, you really are ill?â€ Ivan stopped short. â€œI wonâ€™t keep you long, I
939987 [29048] wonâ€™t even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?â€
939987 [29049] 
939987 [29050] He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down on
939987 [29051] it.
939987 [29052] 
939987 [29053] â€œWhy do you look at me without speaking? Iâ€™ve only come with one question,
939987 [29054] and I swear I wonâ€™t go without an answer. Has the young lady, Katerina
939987 [29055] Ivanovna, been with you?â€
939987 [29056] 
939987 [29057] Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.
939987 [29058] Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.
939987 [29059] 
939987 [29060] â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you?â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [29061] 
939987 [29062] â€œNothing.â€
939987 [29063] 
939987 [29064] â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜nothingâ€™?â€
939987 [29065] 
939987 [29066] â€œYes, she has. Itâ€™s no matter to you. Let me alone.â€
939987 [29067] 
939987 [29068] â€œNo, I wonâ€™t let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?â€
939987 [29069] 
939987 [29070] â€œWhy, Iâ€™d quite forgotten about her,â€ said Smerdyakov, with a scornful
939987 [29071] smile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him with a look of
939987 [29072] frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on him at their last
939987 [29073] interview, a month before.
939987 [29074] 
939987 [29075] â€œYou seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you donâ€™t look like
939987 [29076] yourself,â€ he said to Ivan.
939987 [29077] 
939987 [29078] â€œNever mind my health, tell me what I ask you.â€
939987 [29079] 
939987 [29080] â€œBut why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow. Are you so
939987 [29081] worried?â€ He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright.
939987 [29082] 
939987 [29083] â€œListen; Iâ€™ve told you I wonâ€™t go away without an answer!â€ Ivan cried,
939987 [29084] intensely irritated.
939987 [29085] 
939987 [29086] â€œWhy do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?â€ said Smerdyakov,
939987 [29087] with a look of suffering.
939987 [29088] 
939987 [29089] â€œDamn it! Iâ€™ve nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and Iâ€™ll go
939987 [29090] away.â€
939987 [29091] 
939987 [29092] â€œIâ€™ve no answer to give you,â€ said Smerdyakov, looking down again.
939987 [29093] 
939987 [29094] â€œYou may be sure Iâ€™ll make you answer!â€
939987 [29095] 
939987 [29096] â€œWhy are you so uneasy?â€ Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply with
939987 [29097] contempt, but almost with repulsion. â€œIs this because the trial begins
939987 [29098] to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; canâ€™t you believe that at last? Go
939987 [29099] home, go to bed and sleep in peace, donâ€™t be afraid of anything.â€
939987 [29100] 
939987 [29101] â€œI donâ€™t understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?â€ Ivan
939987 [29102] articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in
939987 [29103] fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.
939987 [29104] 
939987 [29105] â€œYou donâ€™t understand?â€ he drawled reproachfully. â€œItâ€™s a strange thing a
939987 [29106] sensible man should care to play such a farce!â€
939987 [29107] 
939987 [29108] Ivan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious tone
939987 [29109] of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in itself. He
939987 [29110] had not taken such a tone even at their last interview.
939987 [29111] 
939987 [29112] â€œI tell you, youâ€™ve nothing to be afraid of. I wonâ€™t say anything about
939987 [29113] you; thereâ€™s no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling!
939987 [29114] Why are your fingers moving like that? Go home, _you_ did not murder him.â€
939987 [29115] 
939987 [29116] Ivan started. He remembered Alyosha.
939987 [29117] 
939987 [29118] â€œI know it was not I,â€ he faltered.
939987 [29119] 
939987 [29120] â€œDo you?â€ Smerdyakov caught him up again.
939987 [29121] 
939987 [29122] Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.
939987 [29123] 
939987 [29124] â€œTell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!â€
939987 [29125] 
939987 [29126] Smerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes on Ivan
939987 [29127] with insane hatred.
939987 [29128] 
939987 [29129] â€œWell, it was you who murdered him, if thatâ€™s it,â€ he whispered furiously.
939987 [29130] 
939987 [29131] Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He laughed
939987 [29132] malignantly.
939987 [29133] 
939987 [29134] â€œYou mean my going away. What you talked about last time?â€
939987 [29135] 
939987 [29136] â€œYou stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understand
939987 [29137] it now.â€
939987 [29138] 
939987 [29139] â€œAll I understand is that you are mad.â€
939987 [29140] 
939987 [29141] â€œArenâ€™t you tired of it? Here we are face to face; whatâ€™s the use of going
939987 [29142] on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it all
939987 [29143] on me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real murderer, I was
939987 [29144] only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your
939987 [29145] words I did it.â€
939987 [29146] 
939987 [29147] â€œ_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?â€ Ivan turned cold.
939987 [29148] 
939987 [29149] Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over with
939987 [29150] a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly; probably
939987 [29151] the genuineness of Ivanâ€™s horror struck him.
939987 [29152] 
939987 [29153] â€œYou donâ€™t mean to say you really did not know?â€ he faltered
939987 [29154] mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still gazed
939987 [29155] at him, and seemed unable to speak.
939987 [29156] 
939987 [29157] 
939987 [29158]     Ach, Vankaâ€™s gone to Petersburg;
939987 [29159]     I wonâ€™t wait till he comes back,
939987 [29160] 
939987 [29161] 
939987 [29162] suddenly echoed in his head.
939987 [29163] 
939987 [29164] â€œDo you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting before
939987 [29165] me,â€ he muttered.
939987 [29166] 
939987 [29167] â€œThereâ€™s no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he is
939987 [29168] here, that third, between us.â€
939987 [29169] 
939987 [29170] â€œWho is he? Who is here? What third person?â€ Ivan cried in alarm, looking
939987 [29171] about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.
939987 [29172] 
939987 [29173] â€œThat third is God Himselfâ€”Providence. He is the third beside us now. Only
939987 [29174] donâ€™t look for Him, you wonâ€™t find Him.â€
939987 [29175] 
939987 [29176] â€œItâ€™s a lie that you killed him!â€ Ivan cried madly. â€œYou are mad, or
939987 [29177] teasing me again!â€
939987 [29178] 
939987 [29179] Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of fear. He
939987 [29180] could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied that Ivan
939987 [29181] knew everything and was trying to â€œthrow it all on him to his face.â€
939987 [29182] 
939987 [29183] â€œWait a minute,â€ he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing up
939987 [29184] his left leg from under the table, he began turning up his trouser leg. He
939987 [29185] was wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he took off his
939987 [29186] garter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and
939987 [29187] suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror.
939987 [29188] 
939987 [29189] â€œHeâ€™s mad!â€ he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that he
939987 [29190] knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and
939987 [29191] straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirely
939987 [29192] unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his stocking, as though he
939987 [29193] were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull
939987 [29194] it out. At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that
939987 [29195] it was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it
939987 [29196] out and laid it on the table.
939987 [29197] 
939987 [29198] â€œHere,â€ he said quietly.
939987 [29199] 
939987 [29200] â€œWhat is it?â€ asked Ivan, trembling.
939987 [29201] 
939987 [29202] â€œKindly look at it,â€ Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.
939987 [29203] 
939987 [29204] Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began
939987 [29205] unfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from
939987 [29206] contact with a loathsome reptile.
939987 [29207] 
939987 [29208] â€œYour hands keep twitching,â€ observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately
939987 [29209] unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets of
939987 [29210] hundred-rouble notes.
939987 [29211] 
939987 [29212] â€œThey are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not count
939987 [29213] them. Take them,â€ Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes. Ivan
939987 [29214] sank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief.
939987 [29215] 
939987 [29216] â€œYou frightened me ... with your stocking,â€ he said, with a strange grin.
939987 [29217] 
939987 [29218] â€œCan you really not have known till now?â€ Smerdyakov asked once more.
939987 [29219] 
939987 [29220] â€œNo, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!â€ He
939987 [29221] suddenly clutched his head in both hands.
939987 [29222] 
939987 [29223] â€œListen. Did you kill him alone? With my brotherâ€™s help or without?â€
939987 [29224] 
939987 [29225] â€œIt was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri
939987 [29226] Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.â€
939987 [29227] 
939987 [29228] â€œAll right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I
939987 [29229] canâ€™t speak properly.â€
939987 [29230] 
939987 [29231] â€œYou were bold enough then. You said â€˜everything was lawful,â€™ and how
939987 [29232] frightened you are now,â€ Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. â€œWonâ€™t you have
939987 [29233] some lemonade? Iâ€™ll ask for some at once. Itâ€™s very refreshing. Only I
939987 [29234] must hide this first.â€
939987 [29235] 
939987 [29236] And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up and call
939987 [29237] at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them,
939987 [29238] but, looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see
939987 [29239] them, he first took out his handkerchief, and as it turned out to be very
939987 [29240] dirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on
939987 [29241] the table, and put it over the notes. The book was _The Sayings of the
939987 [29242] Holy Father Isaac the Syrian_. Ivan read it mechanically.
939987 [29243] 
939987 [29244] â€œI wonâ€™t have any lemonade,â€ he said. â€œTalk of me later. Sit down and tell
939987 [29245] me how you did it. Tell me all about it.â€
939987 [29246] 
939987 [29247] â€œYouâ€™d better take off your greatcoat, or youâ€™ll be too hot.â€ Ivan, as
939987 [29248] though heâ€™d only just thought of it, took off his coat, and, without
939987 [29249] getting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.
939987 [29250] 
939987 [29251] â€œSpeak, please, speak.â€
939987 [29252] 
939987 [29253] He seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell him
939987 [29254] _all_ about it.
939987 [29255] 
939987 [29256] â€œHow it was done?â€ sighed Smerdyakov. â€œIt was done in a most natural way,
939987 [29257] following your very words.â€
939987 [29258] 
939987 [29259] â€œOf my words later,â€ Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete
939987 [29260] self-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting as before.
939987 [29261] â€œOnly tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as it happened. Donâ€™t
939987 [29262] forget anything. The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.â€
939987 [29263] 
939987 [29264] â€œYouâ€™d gone away, then I fell into the cellar.â€
939987 [29265] 
939987 [29266] â€œIn a fit or in a sham one?â€
939987 [29267] 
939987 [29268] â€œA sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down the steps to
939987 [29269] the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a scream,
939987 [29270] and struggled, till they carried me out.â€
939987 [29271] 
939987 [29272] â€œStay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the hospital?â€
939987 [29273] 
939987 [29274] â€œNo, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me to the
939987 [29275] hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than Iâ€™ve had for
939987 [29276] years. For two days I was quite unconscious.â€
939987 [29277] 
939987 [29278] â€œAll right, all right. Go on.â€
939987 [29279] 
939987 [29280] â€œThey laid me on the bed. I knew Iâ€™d be the other side of the partition,
939987 [29281] for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there, near them.
939987 [29282] Sheâ€™s always been very kind to me, from my birth up. At night I moaned,
939987 [29283] but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.â€
939987 [29284] 
939987 [29285] â€œExpecting him? To come to you?â€
939987 [29286] 
939987 [29287] â€œNot to me. I expected him to come into the house, for Iâ€™d no doubt that
939987 [29288] heâ€™d come that night, for being without me and getting no news, heâ€™d be
939987 [29289] sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used to, and do something.â€
939987 [29290] 
939987 [29291] â€œAnd if he hadnâ€™t come?â€
939987 [29292] 
939987 [29293] â€œThen nothing would have happened. I should never have brought myself to
939987 [29294] it without him.â€
939987 [29295] 
939987 [29296] â€œAll right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, donâ€™t hurry; above all,
939987 [29297] donâ€™t leave anything out!â€
939987 [29298] 
939987 [29299] â€œI expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain, for
939987 [29300] I had prepared him for it ... during the last few days.... He knew about
939987 [29301] the knocks, that was the chief thing. With his suspiciousness and the fury
939987 [29302] which had been growing in him all those days, he was bound to get into the
939987 [29303] house by means of those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expecting
939987 [29304] him.â€
939987 [29305] 
939987 [29306] â€œStay,â€ Ivan interrupted; â€œif he had killed him, he would have taken the
939987 [29307] money and carried it away; you must have considered that. What would you
939987 [29308] have got by it afterwards? I donâ€™t see.â€
939987 [29309] 
939987 [29310] â€œBut he would never have found the money. That was only what I told him,
939987 [29311] that the money was under the mattress. But that wasnâ€™t true. It had been
939987 [29312] lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was
939987 [29313] the only person he trusted, to hide the envelope with the notes in the
939987 [29314] corner behind the ikons, for no one would have guessed that place,
939987 [29315] especially if they came in a hurry. So thatâ€™s where the envelope lay, in
939987 [29316] the corner behind the ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it under
939987 [29317] the mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was
939987 [29318] under the mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [29319] had committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have run away
939987 [29320] in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or he
939987 [29321] would have been arrested. So I could always have clambered up to the ikons
939987 [29322] and have taken away the money next morning or even that night, and it
939987 [29323] would have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon
939987 [29324] that.â€
939987 [29325] 
939987 [29326] â€œBut what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?â€
939987 [29327] 
939987 [29328] â€œIf he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take the
939987 [29329] money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he would
939987 [29330] beat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then Iâ€™d
939987 [29331] make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [29332] who had taken the money after beating him.â€
939987 [29333] 
939987 [29334] â€œStop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him;
939987 [29335] you only took the money?â€
939987 [29336] 
939987 [29337] â€œNo, he didnâ€™t kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now that he
939987 [29338] was the murderer.... But I donâ€™t want to lie to you now, because ...
939987 [29339] because if you really havenâ€™t understood till now, as I see for myself,
939987 [29340] and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face,
939987 [29341] you are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the murder and
939987 [29342] charged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it. And so I want to
939987 [29343] prove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the
939987 [29344] whole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You
939987 [29345] are the rightful murderer.â€
939987 [29346] 
939987 [29347] â€œWhy, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!â€ Ivan cried, unable to restrain
939987 [29348] himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself
939987 [29349] till the end of the conversation. â€œYou still mean that Tchermashnya? Stay,
939987 [29350] tell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took Tchermashnya for
939987 [29351] consent? How will you explain that now?â€
939987 [29352] 
939987 [29353] â€œAssured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldnâ€™t have made
939987 [29354] an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if Iâ€™d been
939987 [29355] suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice; on the
939987 [29356] contrary, you would have protected me from others.... And when you got
939987 [29357] your inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all the
939987 [29358] rest of your life. For youâ€™d have received your inheritance through me,
939987 [29359] seeing that if he had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldnâ€™t have had
939987 [29360] a farthing.â€
939987 [29361] 
939987 [29362] â€œAh! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,â€ snarled Ivan.
939987 [29363] â€œAnd what if I hadnâ€™t gone away then, but had informed against you?â€
939987 [29364] 
939987 [29365] â€œWhat could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to Tchermashnya?
939987 [29366] Thatâ€™s all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you would either have
939987 [29367] gone away or have stayed. If you had stayed, nothing would have happened.
939987 [29368] I should have known that you didnâ€™t want it done, and should have
939987 [29369] attempted nothing. As you went away, it meant you assured me that you
939987 [29370] wouldnâ€™t dare to inform against me at the trial, and that youâ€™d overlook
939987 [29371] my having the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldnâ€™t have prosecuted me
939987 [29372] afterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court; that is,
939987 [29373] not that I had stolen the money or killed himâ€”I shouldnâ€™t have said
939987 [29374] thatâ€”but that youâ€™d put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didnâ€™t
939987 [29375] consent to it. Thatâ€™s why I needed your consent, so that you couldnâ€™t have
939987 [29376] cornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have had? I could always
939987 [29377] have cornered you, revealing your eagerness for your fatherâ€™s death, and I
939987 [29378] tell you the public would have believed it all, and you would have been
939987 [29379] ashamed for the rest of your life.â€
939987 [29380] 
939987 [29381] â€œWas I then so eager, was I?â€ Ivan snarled again.
939987 [29382] 
939987 [29383] â€œTo be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doing
939987 [29384] it.â€ Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He was very weak and spoke
939987 [29385] slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him on. He evidently
939987 [29386] had some design. Ivan felt that.
939987 [29387] 
939987 [29388] â€œGo on,â€ he said. â€œTell me what happened that night.â€
939987 [29389] 
939987 [29390] â€œWhat more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard the master
939987 [29391] shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came
939987 [29392] out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence and darkness.
939987 [29393] I lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldnâ€™t bear it. I got up at
939987 [29394] last, went out. I saw the window open on the left into the garden, and I
939987 [29395] stepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and I
939987 [29396] heard the master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. â€˜Ech!â€™ I
939987 [29397] thought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, â€˜Itâ€™s I.â€™ And he
939987 [29398] shouted to me, â€˜Heâ€™s been, heâ€™s been; heâ€™s run away.â€™ He meant Dmitri
939987 [29399] Fyodorovitch had been. â€˜Heâ€™s killed Grigory!â€™ â€˜Where?â€™ I whispered.
939987 [29400] â€˜There, in the corner,â€™ he pointed. He was whispering, too. â€˜Wait a bit,â€™
939987 [29401] I said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and there I came upon
939987 [29402] Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless. So
939987 [29403] itâ€™s true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that
939987 [29404] came into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, as
939987 [29405] Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, as
939987 [29406] he lay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake
939987 [29407] up. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came over
939987 [29408] me, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master
939987 [29409] and said, â€˜Sheâ€™s here, sheâ€™s come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants
939987 [29410] to be let in.â€™ And he started like a baby. â€˜Where is she?â€™ he fairly
939987 [29411] gasped, but couldnâ€™t believe it. â€˜Sheâ€™s standing there,â€™ said I. â€˜Open.â€™
939987 [29412] He looked out of the window at me, half believing and half distrustful,
939987 [29413] but afraid to open. â€˜Why, he is afraid of me now,â€™ I thought. And it was
939987 [29414] funny. I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps weâ€™d agreed
939987 [29415] upon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his
939987 [29416] eyes. He didnâ€™t seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps,
939987 [29417] he ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but
939987 [29418] he stood in the way to prevent me passing. â€˜Where is she? Where is she?â€™
939987 [29419] He looked at me, all of a tremble. â€˜Well,â€™ thought I, â€˜if heâ€™s so
939987 [29420] frightened of me as all that, itâ€™s a bad look out!â€™ And my legs went weak
939987 [29421] with fright that he wouldnâ€™t let me in or would call out, or Marfa
939987 [29422] Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might happen. I donâ€™t remember
939987 [29423] now, but I must have stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, â€˜Why,
939987 [29424] sheâ€™s there, there, under the window; how is it you donâ€™t see her?â€™ I
939987 [29425] said. â€˜Bring her then, bring her.â€™ â€˜Sheâ€™s afraid,â€™ said I; â€˜she was
939987 [29426] frightened at the noise, sheâ€™s hidden in the bushes; go and call to her
939987 [29427] yourself from the study.â€™ He ran to the window, put the candle in the
939987 [29428] window. â€˜Grushenka,â€™ he cried, â€˜Grushenka, are you here?â€™ Though he cried
939987 [29429] that, he didnâ€™t want to lean out of the window, he didnâ€™t want to move
939987 [29430] away from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didnâ€™t
939987 [29431] dare to turn his back on me. â€˜Why, here she is,â€™ said I. I went up to the
939987 [29432] window and leaned right out of it. â€˜Here she is; sheâ€™s in the bush,
939987 [29433] laughing at you, donâ€™t you see her?â€™ He suddenly believed it; he was all
939987 [29434] of a shakeâ€”he was awfully crazy about herâ€”and he leaned right out of the
939987 [29435] window. I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table; do you
939987 [29436] remember, weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top
939987 [29437] of the skull with the corner of it. He didnâ€™t even cry out. He only sank
939987 [29438] down suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I
939987 [29439] knew Iâ€™d broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face upwards,
939987 [29440] covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on me, not a spot.
939987 [29441] I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up to the ikons, took the
939987 [29442] money out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on the floor and the
939987 [29443] pink ribbon beside it. I went out into the garden all of a tremble,
939987 [29444] straight to the apple-tree with a hollow in itâ€”you know that hollow. Iâ€™d
939987 [29445] marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I
939987 [29446] wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And
939987 [29447] there it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out
939987 [29448] of the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, â€˜If Grigory
939987 [29449] Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me, but if
939987 [29450] he is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then heâ€™ll bear
939987 [29451] witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he must have killed
939987 [29452] him and taken the money.â€™ Then I began groaning with suspense and
939987 [29453] impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last
939987 [29454] she got up and she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch
939987 [29455] was not there, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And that
939987 [29456] set it all going and set my mind at rest.â€
939987 [29457] 
939987 [29458] He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without
939987 [29459] stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov
939987 [29460] glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept his eyes
939987 [29461] averted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated and was breathing
939987 [29462] hard. The perspiration stood out on his face. But it was impossible to
939987 [29463] tell whether it was remorse he was feeling, or what.
939987 [29464] 
939987 [29465] â€œStay,â€ cried Ivan, pondering. â€œWhat about the door? If he only opened the
939987 [29466] door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before? For Grigory saw
939987 [29467] it before you went.â€
939987 [29468] 
939987 [29469] It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone, not
939987 [29470] angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment and
939987 [29471] peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded that they were
939987 [29472] talking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.
939987 [29473] 
939987 [29474] â€œAs for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitchâ€™s having seen it open, thatâ€™s
939987 [29475] only his fancy,â€ said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. â€œHe is not a man, I
939987 [29476] assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didnâ€™t see it, but fancied he had
939987 [29477] seen it, and thereâ€™s no shaking him. Itâ€™s just our luck he took that
939987 [29478] notion into his head, for they canâ€™t fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch
939987 [29479] after that.â€
939987 [29480] 
939987 [29481] â€œListen ...â€ said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making an
939987 [29482] effort to grasp something. â€œListen. There are a lot of questions I want to
939987 [29483] ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.
939987 [29484] Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and leave it
939987 [29485] there on the floor? Why didnâ€™t you simply carry off the envelope?... When
939987 [29486] you were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the
939987 [29487] right thing to do ... but why, I canâ€™t understand....â€
939987 [29488] 
939987 [29489] â€œI did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about it, as I
939987 [29490] did for instance, if heâ€™d seen those notes before, and perhaps had put
939987 [29491] them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up and
939987 [29492] addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done the murder, what
939987 [29493] should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards, especially in such
939987 [29494] desperate haste, since heâ€™d know for certain the notes must be in the
939987 [29495] envelope? No, if the robber had been some one like me, heâ€™d simply have
939987 [29496] put the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he
939987 [29497] could. But itâ€™d be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew
939987 [29498] about the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if heâ€™d found it,
939987 [29499] for instance, under the mattress, heâ€™d have torn it open as quickly as
939987 [29500] possible to make sure the notes were in it. And heâ€™d have thrown the
939987 [29501] envelope down, without having time to think that it would be evidence
939987 [29502] against him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had never directly
939987 [29503] stolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born, and if he did bring
939987 [29504] himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking what
939987 [29505] was his own, for heâ€™d told the whole town he meant to before, and had even
939987 [29506] bragged aloud before every one that heâ€™d go and take his property from
939987 [29507] Fyodor Pavlovitch. I didnâ€™t say that openly to the prosecutor when I was
939987 [29508] being examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as
939987 [29509] though I didnâ€™t see it myself, and as though heâ€™d thought of it himself
939987 [29510] and I hadnâ€™t prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutorâ€™s mouth positively
939987 [29511] watered at my suggestion.â€
939987 [29512] 
939987 [29513] â€œBut can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?â€ cried Ivan,
939987 [29514] overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm.
939987 [29515] 
939987 [29516] â€œMercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry? It
939987 [29517] was all thought out beforehand.â€
939987 [29518] 
939987 [29519] â€œWell ... well, it was the devil helped you!â€ Ivan cried again. â€œNo, you
939987 [29520] are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....â€
939987 [29521] 
939987 [29522] He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was in terrible
939987 [29523] distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room to
939987 [29524] pass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stood
939987 [29525] and sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, as
939987 [29526] he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before.
939987 [29527] 
939987 [29528] â€œListen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Donâ€™t you understand that
939987 [29529] if I havenâ€™t killed you, itâ€™s simply because I am keeping you to answer
939987 [29530] to-morrow at the trial. God sees,â€ Ivan raised his hand, â€œperhaps I, too,
939987 [29531] was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my fatherâ€™s ...
939987 [29532] death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didnâ€™t
939987 [29533] urge you on at all. No, no, I didnâ€™t urge you on! But no matter, I will
939987 [29534] give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial. Iâ€™m determined to! I
939987 [29535] shall tell everything, everything. But weâ€™ll make our appearance together.
939987 [29536] And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you
939987 [29537] give, Iâ€™ll face it; I am not afraid of you. Iâ€™ll confirm it all myself!
939987 [29538] But you must confess, too! You must, you must; weâ€™ll go together. Thatâ€™s
939987 [29539] how it shall be!â€
939987 [29540] 
939987 [29541] Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it
939987 [29542] could be seen that it would be so.
939987 [29543] 
939987 [29544] â€œYou are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,â€ Smerdyakov
939987 [29545] commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact.
939987 [29546] 
939987 [29547] â€œWeâ€™ll go together,â€ Ivan repeated. â€œAnd if you wonâ€™t go, no matter, Iâ€™ll
939987 [29548] go alone.â€
939987 [29549] 
939987 [29550] Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
939987 [29551] 
939987 [29552] â€œThereâ€™ll be nothing of the sort, and you wonâ€™t go,â€ he concluded at last
939987 [29553] positively.
939987 [29554] 
939987 [29555] â€œYou donâ€™t understand me,â€ Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
939987 [29556] 
939987 [29557] â€œYouâ€™ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, whatâ€™s more, it
939987 [29558] will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never said
939987 [29559] anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it looks
939987 [29560] like it, too), or that youâ€™re so sorry for your brother that you are
939987 [29561] sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me, for
939987 [29562] youâ€™ve always thought no more of me than if Iâ€™d been a fly. And who will
939987 [29563] believe you, and what single proof have you got?â€
939987 [29564] 
939987 [29565] â€œListen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.â€
939987 [29566] 
939987 [29567] Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
939987 [29568] 
939987 [29569] â€œTake that money away with you,â€ Smerdyakov sighed.
939987 [29570] 
939987 [29571] â€œOf course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you
939987 [29572] committed the murder for the sake of it?â€ Ivan looked at him with great
939987 [29573] surprise.
939987 [29574] 
939987 [29575] â€œI donâ€™t want it,â€ Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a
939987 [29576] gesture of refusal. â€œI did have an idea of beginning a new life with that
939987 [29577] money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chiefly
939987 [29578] because â€˜all things are lawful.â€™ That was quite right what you taught me,
939987 [29579] for you talked a lot to me about that. For if thereâ€™s no everlasting God,
939987 [29580] thereâ€™s no such thing as virtue, and thereâ€™s no need of it. You were right
939987 [29581] there. So thatâ€™s how I looked at it.â€
939987 [29582] 
939987 [29583] â€œDid you come to that of yourself?â€ asked Ivan, with a wry smile.
939987 [29584] 
939987 [29585] â€œWith your guidance.â€
939987 [29586] 
939987 [29587] â€œAnd now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back the
939987 [29588] money?â€
939987 [29589] 
939987 [29590] â€œNo, I donâ€™t believe,â€ whispered Smerdyakov.
939987 [29591] 
939987 [29592] â€œThen why are you giving it back?â€
939987 [29593] 
939987 [29594] â€œLeave off ... thatâ€™s enough!â€ Smerdyakov waved his hand again. â€œYou used
939987 [29595] to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so upset,
939987 [29596] too? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself.... Only
939987 [29597] thereâ€™ll be nothing of the sort! You wonâ€™t go to give evidence,â€
939987 [29598] Smerdyakov decided with conviction.
939987 [29599] 
939987 [29600] â€œYouâ€™ll see,â€ said Ivan.
939987 [29601] 
939987 [29602] â€œIt isnâ€™t possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I know
939987 [29603] that. You like to be respected, too, for youâ€™re very proud; you are far
939987 [29604] too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living in
939987 [29605] undisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any oneâ€”thatâ€™s what you
939987 [29606] care most about. You wonâ€™t want to spoil your life for ever by taking such
939987 [29607] a disgrace on yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like
939987 [29608] him than any of his children; youâ€™ve the same soul as he had.â€
939987 [29609] 
939987 [29610] â€œYou are not a fool,â€ said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to his
939987 [29611] face. â€œYou are serious now!â€ he observed, looking suddenly at Smerdyakov
939987 [29612] with a different expression.
939987 [29613] 
939987 [29614] â€œIt was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the money.â€
939987 [29615] 
939987 [29616] Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without
939987 [29617] wrapping them in anything.
939987 [29618] 
939987 [29619] â€œI shall show them at the court to-morrow,â€ he said.
939987 [29620] 
939987 [29621] â€œNobody will believe you, as youâ€™ve plenty of money of your own; you may
939987 [29622] simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court.â€
939987 [29623] 
939987 [29624] Ivan rose from his seat.
939987 [29625] 
939987 [29626] â€œI repeat,â€ he said, â€œthe only reason I havenâ€™t killed you is that I need
939987 [29627] you for to-morrow, remember that, donâ€™t forget it!â€
939987 [29628] 
939987 [29629] â€œWell, kill me. Kill me now,â€ Smerdyakov said, all at once looking
939987 [29630] strangely at Ivan. â€œYou wonâ€™t dare do that even!â€ he added, with a bitter
939987 [29631] smile. â€œYou wonâ€™t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!â€
939987 [29632] 
939987 [29633] â€œTill to-morrow,â€ cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
939987 [29634] 
939987 [29635] â€œStay a moment.... Show me those notes again.â€
939987 [29636] 
939987 [29637] Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at them
939987 [29638] for ten seconds.
939987 [29639] 
939987 [29640] â€œWell, you can go,â€ he said, with a wave of his hand. â€œIvan Fyodorovitch!â€
939987 [29641] he called after him again.
939987 [29642] 
939987 [29643] â€œWhat do you want?â€ Ivan turned without stopping.
939987 [29644] 
939987 [29645] â€œGood-by!â€
939987 [29646] 
939987 [29647] â€œTill to-morrow!â€ Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage.
939987 [29648] 
939987 [29649] The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, but
939987 [29650] suddenly began staggering. â€œItâ€™s something physical,â€ he thought with a
939987 [29651] grin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was conscious
939987 [29652] of unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering that had so
939987 [29653] tortured him of late. His determination was taken, â€œand now it will not be
939987 [29654] changed,â€ he thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against
939987 [29655] something and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feet
939987 [29656] the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless. The
939987 [29657] snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized him and lifted him in his
939987 [29658] arms. Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up, knocked
939987 [29659] at the shutters, and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him
939987 [29660] carry the peasant to the police-station, promising him three roubles. The
939987 [29661] man got ready and came out. I wonâ€™t describe in detail how Ivan succeeded
939987 [29662] in his object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging
939987 [29663] for a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the
939987 [29664] expenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan
939987 [29665] was well content with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.
939987 [29666] 
939987 [29667] â€œIf I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,â€ he reflected
939987 [29668] with satisfaction, â€œI should not have stayed a whole hour to look after
939987 [29669] the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his being
939987 [29670] frozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,â€ he thought at
939987 [29671] the same instant, with still greater satisfaction, â€œalthough they have
939987 [29672] decided that I am going out of my mind!â€
939987 [29673] 
939987 [29674] Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself suddenly
939987 [29675] hadnâ€™t he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything. He
939987 [29676] decided the question by turning back to the house. â€œEverything together
939987 [29677] to-morrow!â€ he whispered to himself, and, strange to say, almost all his
939987 [29678] gladness and self-satisfaction passed in one instant.
939987 [29679] 
939987 [29680] As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his
939987 [29681] heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of something
939987 [29682] agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and had
939987 [29683] been there before. He sank wearily on his sofa. The old woman brought him
939987 [29684] a samovar; he made tea, but did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt
939987 [29685] giddy. He felt that he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop
939987 [29686] asleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his
939987 [29687] drowsiness. At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness
939987 [29688] that he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round, as
939987 [29689] though searching for something. This happened several times. At last his
939987 [29690] eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush
939987 [29691] suffused his face. He sat a long time in his place, his head propped on
939987 [29692] both arms, though he looked sideways at the same point, at the sofa that
939987 [29693] stood against the opposite wall. There was evidently something, some
939987 [29694] object, that irritated him there, worried him and tormented him.
939987 [29695] 
939987 [29696] 
939987 [29697] 
939987 [29698] Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivanâ€™s Nightmare
939987 [29699] 
939987 [29700] 
939987 [29701] I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must
939987 [29702] inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivanâ€™s illness.
939987 [29703] Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment on
939987 [29704] the very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long been
939987 [29705] affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the
939987 [29706] end gained complete mastery over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I
939987 [29707] venture to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible
939987 [29708] effort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of
939987 [29709] course, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he loathed
939987 [29710] the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis in
939987 [29711] his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him, to say what he
939987 [29712] had to say boldly and resolutely and â€œto justify himself to himself.â€
939987 [29713] 
939987 [29714] He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from
939987 [29715] Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s to which I have
939987 [29716] referred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor came
939987 [29717] to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the
939987 [29718] brain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had
939987 [29719] reluctantly made him. â€œHallucinations are quite likely in your condition,â€
939987 [29720] the doctor opined, â€œthough it would be better to verify them ... you must
939987 [29721] take steps at once, without a momentâ€™s delay, or things will go badly with
939987 [29722] you.â€ But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to
939987 [29723] his bed to be nursed. â€œI am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I
939987 [29724] drop, itâ€™ll be different then, any one may nurse me who likes,â€ he
939987 [29725] decided, dismissing the subject.
939987 [29726] 
939987 [29727] And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as I
939987 [29728] have said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa against
939987 [29729] the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodness
939987 [29730] knows how he had come in, for he had not been in the room when Ivan came
939987 [29731] into it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more
939987 [29732] accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer
939987 [29733] young, _qui faisait la cinquantaine_, as the French say, with rather long,
939987 [29734] still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed
939987 [29735] beard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently
939987 [29736] made by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,
939987 [29737] that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two
939987 [29738] years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are
939987 [29739] worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his
939987 [29740] linen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare. The
939987 [29741] visitorâ€™s check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light in
939987 [29742] color and too tight for the present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat was
939987 [29743] out of keeping with the season.
939987 [29744] 
939987 [29745] In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. It
939987 [29746] looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners
939987 [29747] who used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had unmistakably been, at
939987 [29748] some time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections,
939987 [29749] had possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming
939987 [29750] gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the
939987 [29751] position of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old
939987 [29752] friend to another and received by them for his companionable and
939987 [29753] accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could
939987 [29754] be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place of
939987 [29755] honor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who
939987 [29756] can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion
939987 [29757] for any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary
939987 [29758] creatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but
939987 [29759] if so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some
939987 [29760] auntâ€™s, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming
939987 [29761] ashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children
939987 [29762] altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas
939987 [29763] letter from them and sometimes even answer it.
939987 [29764] 
939987 [29765] The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, as
939987 [29766] accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might
939987 [29767] arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black
939987 [29768] ribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring
939987 [29769] with a cheap opal stone in it.
939987 [29770] 
939987 [29771] Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The visitor
939987 [29772] waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his
939987 [29773] room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeing
939987 [29774] that his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was ready for any
939987 [29775] affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it. All at once his
939987 [29776] face expressed a sudden solicitude.
939987 [29777] 
939987 [29778] â€œI say,â€ he began to Ivan, â€œexcuse me, I only mention it to remind you.
939987 [29779] You went to Smerdyakovâ€™s to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you came
939987 [29780] away without finding out anything about her, you probably forgotâ€”â€
939987 [29781] 
939987 [29782] â€œAh, yes,â€ broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. â€œYes,
939987 [29783] Iâ€™d forgotten ... but it doesnâ€™t matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,â€
939987 [29784] he muttered to himself, â€œand you,â€ he added, addressing his visitor, â€œI
939987 [29785] should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was
939987 [29786] tormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you
939987 [29787] prompted me, and that I didnâ€™t remember it of myself?â€
939987 [29788] 
939987 [29789] â€œDonâ€™t believe it then,â€ said the gentleman, smiling amicably, â€œwhatâ€™s the
939987 [29790] good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to
939987 [29791] believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he saw
939987 [29792] Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look at the
939987 [29793] spiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them ... only fancy,
939987 [29794] they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because the
939987 [29795] devils show them their horns from the other world. That, they say, is a
939987 [29796] material proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world. The other
939987 [29797] world and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does
939987 [29798] proving thereâ€™s a devil prove that thereâ€™s a God? I want to join an
939987 [29799] idealist society, Iâ€™ll lead the opposition in it, Iâ€™ll say I am a realist,
939987 [29800] but not a materialist, he he!â€
939987 [29801] 
939987 [29802] â€œListen,â€ Ivan suddenly got up from the table. â€œI seem to be delirious....
939987 [29803] I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I donâ€™t care! You
939987 [29804] wonâ€™t drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehow
939987 [29805] ashamed.... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes donâ€™t see you
939987 [29806] and donâ€™t even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess what
939987 [29807] you are prating, for itâ€™s I, _I myself speaking, not you_. Only I donâ€™t
939987 [29808] know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. Iâ€™ll
939987 [29809] wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps youâ€™ll vanish into air.â€
939987 [29810] 
939987 [29811] Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a
939987 [29812] wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.
939987 [29813] 
939987 [29814] â€œI am so glad you treat me so familiarly,â€ the visitor began.
939987 [29815] 
939987 [29816] â€œFool,â€ laughed Ivan, â€œdo you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you?
939987 [29817] I am in good spirits now, though Iâ€™ve a pain in my forehead ... and in the
939987 [29818] top of my head ... only please donâ€™t talk philosophy, as you did last
939987 [29819] time. If you canâ€™t take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk
939987 [29820] gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What a
939987 [29821] nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. Iâ€™ll get the better of you.
939987 [29822] I wonâ€™t be taken to a mad-house!â€
939987 [29823] 
939987 [29824] â€œ_Câ€™est charmant_, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what
939987 [29825] am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you and
939987 [29826] am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for
939987 [29827] something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring last
939987 [29828] timeâ€”â€
939987 [29829] 
939987 [29830] â€œNever for one minute have I taken you for reality,â€ Ivan cried with a
939987 [29831] sort of fury. â€œYou are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. Itâ€™s
939987 [29832] only that I donâ€™t know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a
939987 [29833] time. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, but
939987 [29834] only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the
939987 [29835] nastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of
939987 [29836] interest to me, if only I had time to waste on youâ€”â€
939987 [29837] 
939987 [29838] â€œExcuse me, excuse me, Iâ€™ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under
939987 [29839] the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him, â€˜You learnt it from _him_!
939987 [29840] How do you know that _he_ visits me?â€™ you were thinking of me then. So for
939987 [29841] one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,â€ the gentleman
939987 [29842] laughed blandly.
939987 [29843] 
939987 [29844] â€œYes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldnâ€™t believe in you. I
939987 [29845] donâ€™t know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only
939987 [29846] dreaming then and didnâ€™t see you really at allâ€”â€
939987 [29847] 
939987 [29848] â€œAnd why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; Iâ€™ve
939987 [29849] treated him badly over Father Zossima.â€
939987 [29850] 
939987 [29851] â€œDonâ€™t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!â€ Ivan laughed again.
939987 [29852] 
939987 [29853] â€œYou scold me, but you laughâ€”thatâ€™s a good sign. But you are ever so much
939987 [29854] more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution
939987 [29855] of yoursâ€”â€
939987 [29856] 
939987 [29857] â€œDonâ€™t speak of my resolution,â€ cried Ivan, savagely.
939987 [29858] 
939987 [29859] â€œI understand, I understand, _câ€™est noble, câ€™est charmant_, you are going
939987 [29860] to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _Câ€™est
939987 [29861] chevaleresque_.â€
939987 [29862] 
939987 [29863] â€œHold your tongue, Iâ€™ll kick you!â€
939987 [29864] 
939987 [29865] â€œI shanâ€™t be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained. If you
939987 [29866] kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people donâ€™t kick ghosts.
939987 [29867] Joking apart, it doesnâ€™t matter to me, scold if you like, though itâ€™s
939987 [29868] better to be a trifle more polite even to me. â€˜Fool, flunkey!â€™ what
939987 [29869] words!â€
939987 [29870] 
939987 [29871] â€œScolding you, I scold myself,â€ Ivan laughed again, â€œyou are myself,
939987 [29872] myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am thinking ...
939987 [29873] and are incapable of saying anything new!â€
939987 [29874] 
939987 [29875] â€œIf I am like you in my way of thinking, itâ€™s all to my credit,â€ the
939987 [29876] gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
939987 [29877] 
939987 [29878] â€œYou choose out only my worst thoughts, and whatâ€™s more, the stupid ones.
939987 [29879] You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I canâ€™t put up with
939987 [29880] you! What am I to do, what am I to do?â€ Ivan said through his clenched
939987 [29881] teeth.
939987 [29882] 
939987 [29883] â€œMy dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to
939987 [29884] be recognized as such,â€ the visitor began in an excess of deprecating and
939987 [29885] simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. â€œI am poor, but ... I
939987 [29886] wonâ€™t say very honest, but ... itâ€™s an axiom generally accepted in society
939987 [29887] that I am a fallen angel. I certainly canâ€™t conceive how I can ever have
939987 [29888] been an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that thereâ€™s
939987 [29889] no harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a
939987 [29890] gentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I
939987 [29891] love men genuinely, Iâ€™ve been greatly calumniated! Here when I stay with
939987 [29892] you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and thatâ€™s what I
939987 [29893] like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I
939987 [29894] love the realism of earth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed,
939987 [29895] here all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but
939987 [29896] indeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming.
939987 [29897] Besides, on earth I become superstitious. Please donâ€™t laugh, thatâ€™s just
939987 [29898] what I like, to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: Iâ€™ve
939987 [29899] grown fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go
939987 [29900] and steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becoming
939987 [29901] incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchantâ€™s wife
939987 [29902] weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she believes. My ideal is to
939987 [29903] go to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it
939987 [29904] is. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like being doctored
939987 [29905] too; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was
939987 [29906] vaccinated in a foundling hospitalâ€”if only you knew how I enjoyed myself
939987 [29907] that day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But you
939987 [29908] are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this evening? I
939987 [29909] know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well, what about your health?
939987 [29910] What did the doctor say?â€
939987 [29911] 
939987 [29912] â€œFool!â€ Ivan snapped out.
939987 [29913] 
939987 [29914] â€œBut you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didnâ€™t ask out of
939987 [29915] sympathy. You neednâ€™t answer. Now rheumatism has come in againâ€”â€
939987 [29916] 
939987 [29917] â€œFool!â€ repeated Ivan.
939987 [29918] 
939987 [29919] â€œYou keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism
939987 [29920] last year that I remember it to this day.â€
939987 [29921] 
939987 [29922] â€œThe devil have rheumatism!â€
939987 [29923] 
939987 [29924] â€œWhy not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form and I
939987 [29925] take the consequences. Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto_.â€
939987 [29926] 
939987 [29927] â€œWhat, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... thatâ€™s not bad for the
939987 [29928] devil!â€
939987 [29929] 
939987 [29930] â€œI am glad Iâ€™ve pleased you at last.â€
939987 [29931] 
939987 [29932] â€œBut you didnâ€™t get that from me.â€ Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.
939987 [29933] â€œThat never entered my head, thatâ€™s strange.â€
939987 [29934] 
939987 [29935] â€œ_Câ€™est du nouveau, nâ€™est-ce pas?_ This time Iâ€™ll act honestly and explain
939987 [29936] to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestion
939987 [29937] or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and
939987 [29938] real actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such
939987 [29939] a plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the
939987 [29940] last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such
939987 [29941] dreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people,
939987 [29942] officials, journalists, priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A
939987 [29943] statesman confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him
939987 [29944] when he was asleep. Well, thatâ€™s how it is now, though I am your
939987 [29945] hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which had
939987 [29946] not entered your head before. So I donâ€™t repeat your ideas, yet I am only
939987 [29947] your nightmare, nothing more.â€
939987 [29948] 
939987 [29949] â€œYou are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my
939987 [29950] nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.â€
939987 [29951] 
939987 [29952] â€œMy dear fellow, Iâ€™ve adopted a special method to-day, Iâ€™ll explain it to
939987 [29953] you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I caught cold then,
939987 [29954] only not here but yonder.â€
939987 [29955] 
939987 [29956] â€œWhere is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Canâ€™t you go away?â€ Ivan
939987 [29957] exclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat down on the
939987 [29958] sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in both
939987 [29959] hands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation. It was
939987 [29960] evidently of no use.
939987 [29961] 
939987 [29962] â€œYour nerves are out of order,â€ observed the gentleman, with a carelessly
939987 [29963] easy, though perfectly polite, air. â€œYou are angry with me even for being
939987 [29964] able to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way. I was
939987 [29965] hurrying then to a diplomatic _soirÃ©e_ at the house of a lady of high rank
939987 [29966] in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry. Well, an
939987 [29967] evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows where and had to
939987 [29968] fly through space to reach your earth.... Of course, it took only an
939987 [29969] instant, but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight
939987 [29970] minutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat. Spirits donâ€™t
939987 [29971] freeze, but when oneâ€™s in fleshly form, well ... in brief, I didnâ€™t think,
939987 [29972] and set off, and you know in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is
939987 [29973] above the firmament, thereâ€™s such a frost ... at least one canâ€™t call it
939987 [29974] frost, you can fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the
939987 [29975] village girls playâ€”they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees
939987 [29976] of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin
939987 [29977] off, so it bleeds. But thatâ€™s only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagine
939987 [29978] it would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it would be the end of
939987 [29979] it ... if only there could be an ax there.â€
939987 [29980] 
939987 [29981] â€œAnd can there be an ax there?â€ Ivan interrupted, carelessly and
939987 [29982] disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the
939987 [29983] delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
939987 [29984] 
939987 [29985] â€œAn ax?â€ the guest interrupted in surprise.
939987 [29986] 
939987 [29987] â€œYes, what would become of an ax there?â€ Ivan cried suddenly, with a sort
939987 [29988] of savage and insistent obstinacy.
939987 [29989] 
939987 [29990] â€œWhat would become of an ax in space? _Quelle idÃ©e!_ If it were to fall to
939987 [29991] any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth without
939987 [29992] knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would calculate the rising
939987 [29993] and the setting of the ax, _Gatzuk_ would put it in his calendar, thatâ€™s
939987 [29994] all.â€
939987 [29995] 
939987 [29996] â€œYou are stupid, awfully stupid,â€ said Ivan peevishly. â€œFib more cleverly
939987 [29997] or I wonâ€™t listen. You want to get the better of me by realism, to
939987 [29998] convince me that you exist, but I donâ€™t want to believe you exist! I wonâ€™t
939987 [29999] believe it!â€
939987 [30000] 
939987 [30001] â€œBut I am not fibbing, itâ€™s all the truth; the truth is unhappily hardly
939987 [30002] ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big of me, and
939987 [30003] perhaps something fine. Thatâ€™s a great pity, for I only give what I canâ€”â€
939987 [30004] 
939987 [30005] â€œDonâ€™t talk philosophy, you ass!â€
939987 [30006] 
939987 [30007] â€œPhilosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning and
939987 [30008] groaning. Iâ€™ve tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnose
939987 [30009] beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips, but
939987 [30010] theyâ€™ve no idea how to cure you. There was an enthusiastic little student
939987 [30011] here, â€˜You may die,â€™ said he, â€˜but youâ€™ll know perfectly what disease you
939987 [30012] are dying of!â€™ And then what a way they have sending people to
939987 [30013] specialists! â€˜We only diagnose,â€™ they say, â€˜but go to such-and-such a
939987 [30014] specialist, heâ€™ll cure you.â€™ The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of
939987 [30015] disease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are only
939987 [30016] specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong
939987 [30017] with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European
939987 [30018] specialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris, heâ€™ll look at your nose; I
939987 [30019] can only cure your right nostril, heâ€™ll tell you, for I donâ€™t cure the
939987 [30020] left nostril, thatâ€™s not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there thereâ€™s a
939987 [30021] specialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I fell
939987 [30022] back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub myself with
939987 [30023] honey and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an extra bath I went,
939987 [30024] smeared myself all over and it did me no good at all. In despair I wrote
939987 [30025] to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a book and some drops, bless him,
939987 [30026] and, only fancy, Hoffâ€™s malt extract cured me! I bought it by accident,
939987 [30027] drank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took it away
939987 [30028] completely. I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was
939987 [30029] prompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a
939987 [30030] bother: not a single paper would take my letter. â€˜It would be very
939987 [30031] reactionary,â€™ they said, â€˜no one will believe it. _Le diable nâ€™existe
939987 [30032] point._ Youâ€™d better remain anonymous,â€™ they advised me. What use is a
939987 [30033] letter of thanks if itâ€™s anonymous? I laughed with the men at the
939987 [30034] newspaper office; â€˜Itâ€™s reactionary to believe in God in our days,â€™ I
939987 [30035] said, â€˜but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.â€™ â€˜We quite understand
939987 [30036] that,â€™ they said. â€˜Who doesnâ€™t believe in the devil? Yet it wonâ€™t do, it
939987 [30037] might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.â€™ But I thought as a
939987 [30038] joke it wouldnâ€™t be very witty. So it wasnâ€™t printed. And do you know, I
939987 [30039] have felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, for
939987 [30040] instance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.â€
939987 [30041] 
939987 [30042] â€œPhilosophical reflections again?â€ Ivan snarled malignantly.
939987 [30043] 
939987 [30044] â€œGod preserve me from it, but one canâ€™t help complaining sometimes. I am a
939987 [30045] slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can see
939987 [30046] you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isnâ€™t the only thing! I have
939987 [30047] naturally a kind and merry heart. â€˜I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.â€™
939987 [30048] You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more
939987 [30049] serious one. Before time was, by some decree which I could never make out,
939987 [30050] I was pre-destined â€˜to denyâ€™ and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not
939987 [30051] at all inclined to negation. â€˜No, you must go and deny, without denial
939987 [30052] thereâ€™s no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of
939987 [30053] criticism?â€™ Without criticism it would be nothing but one â€˜hosannah.â€™ But
939987 [30054] nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried in
939987 [30055] the crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style. But I donâ€™t meddle in
939987 [30056] that, I didnâ€™t create it, I am not answerable for it. Well, theyâ€™ve chosen
939987 [30057] their scapegoat, theyâ€™ve made me write the column of criticism and so life
939987 [30058] was made possible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask
939987 [30059] for annihilation. No, live, I am told, for thereâ€™d be nothing without you.
939987 [30060] If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen. There
939987 [30061] would be no events without you, and there must be events. So against the
939987 [30062] grain I serve to produce events and do whatâ€™s irrational because I am
939987 [30063] commanded to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farce
939987 [30064] as something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course
939987 [30065] ... but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for
939987 [30066] suffering is life. Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It
939987 [30067] would be transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but
939987 [30068] tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I donâ€™t live. I am x in
939987 [30069] an indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all
939987 [30070] beginning and end, and who has even forgotten his own name. You are
939987 [30071] laughingâ€” no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. You are for ever
939987 [30072] angry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that I would
939987 [30073] give away all this super-stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply to
939987 [30074] be transformed into the soul of a merchantâ€™s wife weighing eighteen stone
939987 [30075] and set candles at Godâ€™s shrine.â€
939987 [30076] 
939987 [30077] â€œThen even you donâ€™t believe in God?â€ said Ivan, with a smile of hatred.
939987 [30078] 
939987 [30079] â€œWhat can I say?â€”that is, if you are in earnestâ€”â€
939987 [30080] 
939987 [30081] â€œIs there a God or not?â€ Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
939987 [30082] 
939987 [30083] â€œAh, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I donâ€™t know.
939987 [30084] There! Iâ€™ve said it now!â€
939987 [30085] 
939987 [30086] â€œYou donâ€™t know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you are
939987 [30087] myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!â€
939987 [30088] 
939987 [30089] â€œWell, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true.
939987 [30090] _Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest, all these
939987 [30091] worlds, God and even Satanâ€”all that is not proved, to my mind. Does all
939987 [30092] that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical
939987 [30093] development of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make haste
939987 [30094] to stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.â€
939987 [30095] 
939987 [30096] â€œYouâ€™d better tell me some anecdote!â€ said Ivan miserably.
939987 [30097] 
939987 [30098] â€œThere is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an
939987 [30099] anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you donâ€™t
939987 [30100] believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are all
939987 [30101] in a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there used
939987 [30102] to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung together
939987 [30103] somehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since weâ€™ve
939987 [30104] learned that youâ€™ve discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and
939987 [30105] the devil knows what, we had to lower our crest. Thereâ€™s a regular muddle,
939987 [30106] and, above all, superstition, scandal; thereâ€™s as much scandal among us as
939987 [30107] among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for we
939987 [30108] have our secret police department where private information is received.
939987 [30109] Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle agesâ€”not yours, but oursâ€”and
939987 [30110] no one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen stone,
939987 [30111] not your old ladies I mean, but ours. Weâ€™ve everything you have, I am
939987 [30112] revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you; though itâ€™s
939987 [30113] forbidden. This legend is about Paradise. There was, they say, here on
939987 [30114] earth a thinker and philosopher. He rejected everything, â€˜laws,
939987 [30115] conscience, faith,â€™ and, above all, the future life. He died; he expected
939987 [30116] to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before
939987 [30117] him. He was astounded and indignant. â€˜This is against my principles!â€™ he
939987 [30118] said. And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me, I am
939987 [30119] just repeating what I heard myself, itâ€™s only a legend ... he was
939987 [30120] sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (weâ€™ve adopted the
939987 [30121] metric system, you know) and when he has finished that quadrillion, the
939987 [30122] gates of heaven would be opened to him and heâ€™ll be forgivenâ€”â€
939987 [30123] 
939987 [30124] â€œAnd what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion
939987 [30125] kilometers?â€ asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
939987 [30126] 
939987 [30127] â€œWhat tortures? Ah, donâ€™t ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now they
939987 [30128] have taken chiefly to moral punishmentsâ€”â€˜the stings of conscienceâ€™ and all
939987 [30129] that nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of your
939987 [30130] manners. And whoâ€™s the better for it? Only those who have got no
939987 [30131] conscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have
939987 [30132] none? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor suffer
939987 [30133] for it. Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them,
939987 [30134] especially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but
939987 [30135] mischief! The ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned
939987 [30136] to the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down
939987 [30137] across the road. â€˜I wonâ€™t go, I refuse on principle!â€™ Take the soul of an
939987 [30138] enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah,
939987 [30139] who sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and you
939987 [30140] get the character of that thinker who lay across the road.â€
939987 [30141] 
939987 [30142] â€œWhat did he lie on there?â€
939987 [30143] 
939987 [30144] â€œWell, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not laughing?â€
939987 [30145] 
939987 [30146] â€œBravo!â€ cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he was
939987 [30147] listening with an unexpected curiosity. â€œWell, is he lying there now?â€
939987 [30148] 
939987 [30149] â€œThatâ€™s the point, that he isnâ€™t. He lay there almost a thousand years and
939987 [30150] then he got up and went on.â€
939987 [30151] 
939987 [30152] â€œWhat an ass!â€ cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming to be
939987 [30153] pondering something intently. â€œDoes it make any difference whether he lies
939987 [30154] there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take a
939987 [30155] billion years to walk it?â€
939987 [30156] 
939987 [30157] â€œMuch more than that. I havenâ€™t got a pencil and paper or I could work it
939987 [30158] out. But he got there long ago, and thatâ€™s where the story begins.â€
939987 [30159] 
939987 [30160] â€œWhat, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do it?â€
939987 [30161] 
939987 [30162] â€œWhy, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present earth may
939987 [30163] have been repeated a billion times. Why, itâ€™s become extinct, been frozen;
939987 [30164] cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again â€˜the water
939987 [30165] above the firmament,â€™ then again a comet, again a sun, again from the sun
939987 [30166] it becomes earthâ€”and the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly
939987 [30167] and exactly the same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably
939987 [30168] tediousâ€”â€
939987 [30169] 
939987 [30170] â€œWell, well, what happened when he arrived?â€
939987 [30171] 
939987 [30172] â€œWhy, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked in, before
939987 [30173] he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to my thinking his
939987 [30174] watch must have long dissolved into its elements on the way), he cried out
939987 [30175] that those two seconds were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometers but
939987 [30176] a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the quadrillionth power! In fact,
939987 [30177] he sang â€˜hosannahâ€™ and overdid it so, that some persons there of lofty
939987 [30178] ideas wouldnâ€™t shake hands with him at firstâ€”heâ€™d become too rapidly
939987 [30179] reactionary, they said. The Russian temperament. I repeat, itâ€™s a legend.
939987 [30180] I give it for what itâ€™s worth. So thatâ€™s the sort of ideas we have on such
939987 [30181] subjects even now.â€
939987 [30182] 
939987 [30183] â€œIâ€™ve caught you!â€ Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight, as though
939987 [30184] he had succeeded in remembering something at last. â€œThat anecdote about
939987 [30185] the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen then, I was at
939987 [30186] the high school. I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow
939987 [30187] called Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic
939987 [30188] that I couldnâ€™t have taken it from anywhere. I thought Iâ€™d forgotten it
939987 [30189] ... but Iâ€™ve unconsciously recalled itâ€”I recalled it myselfâ€”it was not you
939987 [30190] telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that
939987 [30191] even when people are being taken to execution ... itâ€™s come back to me in
939987 [30192] a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream, not a living creature!â€
939987 [30193] 
939987 [30194] â€œFrom the vehemence with which you deny my existence,â€ laughed the
939987 [30195] gentleman, â€œI am convinced that you believe in me.â€
939987 [30196] 
939987 [30197] â€œNot in the slightest! I havenâ€™t a hundredth part of a grain of faith in
939987 [30198] you!â€
939987 [30199] 
939987 [30200] â€œBut you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses perhaps are the
939987 [30201] strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the ten-thousandth of a
939987 [30202] grain.â€
939987 [30203] 
939987 [30204] â€œNot for one minute,â€ cried Ivan furiously. â€œBut I should like to believe
939987 [30205] in you,â€ he added strangely.
939987 [30206] 
939987 [30207] â€œAha! Thereâ€™s an admission! But I am good-natured. Iâ€™ll come to your
939987 [30208] assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me. I told you your
939987 [30209] anecdote youâ€™d forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in me
939987 [30210] completely.â€
939987 [30211] 
939987 [30212] â€œYou are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of your
939987 [30213] existence!â€
939987 [30214] 
939987 [30215] â€œJust so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
939987 [30216] disbeliefâ€”is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as you
939987 [30217] are, that itâ€™s better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you are
939987 [30218] inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling you
939987 [30219] that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and I have my
939987 [30220] motive in it. Itâ€™s the new method. As soon as you disbelieve in me
939987 [30221] completely, youâ€™ll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but
939987 [30222] a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained my object, which is an
939987 [30223] honorable one. I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will
939987 [30224] grow into an oak-treeâ€”and such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will
939987 [30225] long to enter the ranks of â€˜the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly
939987 [30226] women,â€™ for that is what you are secretly longing for. Youâ€™ll dine on
939987 [30227] locusts, youâ€™ll wander into the wilderness to save your soul!â€
939987 [30228] 
939987 [30229] â€œThen itâ€™s for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, you
939987 [30230] scoundrel?â€
939987 [30231] 
939987 [30232] â€œOne must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you are!â€
939987 [30233] 
939987 [30234] â€œFool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed
939987 [30235] seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss?â€
939987 [30236] 
939987 [30237] â€œMy dear fellow, Iâ€™ve done nothing else. One forgets the whole world and
939987 [30238] all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he is a very
939987 [30239] precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes worth a whole
939987 [30240] constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you know. The conquest is
939987 [30241] priceless! And some of them, on my word, are not inferior to you in
939987 [30242] culture, though you wonâ€™t believe it. They can contemplate such depths of
939987 [30243] belief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems
939987 [30244] that they are within a hairâ€™s-breadth of being â€˜turned upside down,â€™ as
939987 [30245] the actor Gorbunov says.â€
939987 [30246] 
939987 [30247] â€œWell, did you get your nose pulled?â€(8)
939987 [30248] 
939987 [30249] â€œMy dear fellow,â€ observed the visitor sententiously, â€œitâ€™s better to get
939987 [30250] off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an afflicted
939987 [30251] marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated by a specialist)
939987 [30252] in confession to his spiritual fatherâ€”a Jesuit. I was present, it was
939987 [30253] simply charming. â€˜Give me back my nose!â€™ he said, and he beat his breast.
939987 [30254] â€˜My son,â€™ said the priest evasively, â€˜all things are accomplished in
939987 [30255] accordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and what seems a
939987 [30256] misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits.
939987 [30257] If stern destiny has deprived you of your nose, itâ€™s to your advantage
939987 [30258] that no one can ever pull you by your nose.â€™ â€˜Holy father, thatâ€™s no
939987 [30259] comfort,â€™ cried the despairing marquis. â€˜Iâ€™d be delighted to have my nose
939987 [30260] pulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.â€™ â€˜My
939987 [30261] son,â€™ sighs the priest, â€˜you canâ€™t expect every blessing at once. This is
939987 [30262] murmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, for
939987 [30263] if you repine as you repined just now, declaring youâ€™d be glad to have
939987 [30264] your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already been
939987 [30265] fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by the
939987 [30266] nose.â€™ â€
939987 [30267] 
939987 [30268] â€œFool, how stupid!â€ cried Ivan.
939987 [30269] 
939987 [30270] â€œMy dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear thatâ€™s the
939987 [30271] genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for word as
939987 [30272] Iâ€™ve told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble. The
939987 [30273] unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got home. I was by
939987 [30274] his side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit confessionals are really
939987 [30275] my most delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Hereâ€™s another
939987 [30276] incident that happened only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of
939987 [30277] twentyâ€”a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth
939987 [30278] waterâ€”comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her sin into the
939987 [30279] grating. â€˜Why, my daughter, have you fallen again already?â€™ cries the
939987 [30280] priest. â€˜O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not the same man this time, how
939987 [30281] long is this going on? Arenâ€™t you ashamed!â€™ â€˜_Ah, mon pÃ¨re_,â€™ answers the
939987 [30282] sinner with tears of penitence, â€˜_Ã§a lui fait tant de plaisir, et Ã  moi si
939987 [30283] peu de peine!_â€™ Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of
939987 [30284] nature, better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on
939987 [30285] the spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the
939987 [30286] priest at the grating making an appointment with her for the
939987 [30287] eveningâ€”though he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It
939987 [30288] was nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning
939987 [30289] up your nose again? Angry again? I donâ€™t know how to please youâ€”â€
939987 [30290] 
939987 [30291] â€œLeave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare,â€
939987 [30292] Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition. â€œI am bored with
939987 [30293] you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give anything to be able to
939987 [30294] shake you off!â€
939987 [30295] 
939987 [30296] â€œI repeat, moderate your expectations, donâ€™t demand of me â€˜everything
939987 [30297] great and nobleâ€™ and youâ€™ll see how well we shall get on,â€ said the
939987 [30298] gentleman impressively. â€œYou are really angry with me for not having
939987 [30299] appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with scorched
939987 [30300] wings, but have shown myself in such a modest form. You are wounded, in
939987 [30301] the first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride.
939987 [30302] How could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is
939987 [30303] that romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I canâ€™t
939987 [30304] help it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
939987 [30305] appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
939987 [30306] Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I was
939987 [30307] positively afraid of doing it, for youâ€™d have thrashed me for daring to
939987 [30308] pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the Polar Star
939987 [30309] or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid, but, mercy on us! I
939987 [30310] make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence. Mephistopheles declared
939987 [30311] to Faust that he desired evil, but did only good. Well, he can say what he
939987 [30312] likes, itâ€™s quite the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all
939987 [30313] creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good. I was there when
939987 [30314] the Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom
939987 [30315] the soul of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim
939987 [30316] singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim
939987 [30317] which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all thatâ€™s
939987 [30318] sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all. The
939987 [30319] word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you know
939987 [30320] how susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am. But common senseâ€”oh,
939987 [30321] a most unhappy trait in my characterâ€”kept me in due bounds and I let the
939987 [30322] moment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have
939987 [30323] happened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been
939987 [30324] extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so, solely
939987 [30325] from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress the
939987 [30326] good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody takes all the credit
939987 [30327] of whatâ€™s good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me. But
939987 [30328] I donâ€™t envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious.
939987 [30329] Why am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent
939987 [30330] people and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to
939987 [30331] take such consequences sometimes? I know, of course, thereâ€™s a secret in
939987 [30332] it, but they wonâ€™t tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps,
939987 [30333] seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable
939987 [30334] minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme
939987 [30335] throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the end of
939987 [30336] everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who would take them in?
939987 [30337] I know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled. I, too, shall
939987 [30338] walk my quadrillion and learn the secret. But till that happens I am
939987 [30339] sulking and fulfill my destiny though itâ€™s against the grainâ€”that is, to
939987 [30340] ruin thousands for the sake of saving one. How many souls have had to be
939987 [30341] ruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that
939987 [30342] one righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days!
939987 [30343] Yes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for
939987 [30344] meâ€”one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the
939987 [30345] other my own. And thereâ€™s no knowing which will turn out the better....
939987 [30346] Are you asleep?â€
939987 [30347] 
939987 [30348] â€œI might well be,â€ Ivan groaned angrily. â€œAll my stupid ideasâ€”outgrown,
939987 [30349] thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcassâ€”you present to
939987 [30350] me as something new!â€
939987 [30351] 
939987 [30352] â€œThereâ€™s no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by my
939987 [30353] literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasnâ€™t bad, was it? And
939987 [30354] then that ironical tone _Ã  la_ Heine, eh?â€
939987 [30355] 
939987 [30356] â€œNo, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a flunkey
939987 [30357] like you?â€
939987 [30358] 
939987 [30359] â€œMy dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russian
939987 [30360] gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, the
939987 [30361] author of a promising poem entitled _The Grand Inquisitor_. I was only
939987 [30362] thinking of him!â€
939987 [30363] 
939987 [30364] â€œI forbid you to speak of _The Grand Inquisitor_,â€ cried Ivan, crimson
939987 [30365] with shame.
939987 [30366] 
939987 [30367] â€œAnd the _Geological Cataclysm_. Do you remember? That was a poem, now!â€
939987 [30368] 
939987 [30369] â€œHold your tongue, or Iâ€™ll kill you!â€
939987 [30370] 
939987 [30371] â€œYouâ€™ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to
939987 [30372] that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quivering
939987 [30373] with eagerness for life! â€˜There are new men,â€™ you decided last spring,
939987 [30374] when you were meaning to come here, â€˜they propose to destroy everything
939987 [30375] and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didnâ€™t ask my advice! I
939987 [30376] maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the
939987 [30377] idea of God in man, thatâ€™s how we have to set to work. Itâ€™s that, that we
939987 [30378] must begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon
939987 [30379] as men have all of them denied Godâ€”and I believe that period, analogous
939987 [30380] with geological periods, will come to passâ€”the old conception of the
939987 [30381] universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, whatâ€™s more, the
939987 [30382] old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from
939987 [30383] life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.
939987 [30384] Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the
939987 [30385] man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature
939987 [30386] infinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from
939987 [30387] hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of
939987 [30388] the joys of heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept
939987 [30389] death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that itâ€™s
939987 [30390] useless for him to repine at lifeâ€™s being a moment, and he will love his
939987 [30391] brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment
939987 [30392] of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify
939987 [30393] its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the
939987 [30394] graveâ€™... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!â€
939987 [30395] 
939987 [30396] Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears,
939987 [30397] but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.
939987 [30398] 
939987 [30399] â€œThe question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such
939987 [30400] a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanity
939987 [30401] is settled for ever. But as, owing to manâ€™s inveterate stupidity, this
939987 [30402] cannot come about for at least a thousand years, every one who recognizes
939987 [30403] the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the
939987 [30404] new principles. In that sense, â€˜all things are lawfulâ€™ for him. Whatâ€™s
939987 [30405] more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no
939987 [30406] God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if
939987 [30407] he is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position,
939987 [30408] he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the
939987 [30409] old slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands,
939987 [30410] the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ...
939987 [30411] â€˜all things are lawfulâ€™ and thatâ€™s the end of it! Thatâ€™s all very
939987 [30412] charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for
939987 [30413] doing it? But thatâ€™s our modern Russian all over. He canâ€™t bring himself
939987 [30414] to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truthâ€”â€
939987 [30415] 
939987 [30416] The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence, speaking
939987 [30417] louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he did not
939987 [30418] succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table and
939987 [30419] flung it at the orator.
939987 [30420] 
939987 [30421] â€œ_Ah, mais câ€™est bÃªte enfin_,â€ cried the latter, jumping up from the sofa
939987 [30422] and shaking the drops of tea off himself. â€œHe remembers Lutherâ€™s inkstand!
939987 [30423] He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! Itâ€™s like a woman!
939987 [30424] I suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears.â€
939987 [30425] 
939987 [30426] A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan jumped
939987 [30427] up from the sofa.
939987 [30428] 
939987 [30429] â€œDo you hear? Youâ€™d better open,â€ cried the visitor; â€œitâ€™s your brother
939987 [30430] Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, Iâ€™ll be bound!â€
939987 [30431] 
939987 [30432] â€œBe silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and of
939987 [30433] course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings â€˜news,â€™ â€ Ivan
939987 [30434] exclaimed frantically.
939987 [30435] 
939987 [30436] â€œOpen, open to him. Thereâ€™s a snowstorm and he is your brother. _Monsieur
939987 [30437] sait-il le temps quâ€™il fait? Câ€™est Ã  ne pas mettre un chien dehors_.â€
939987 [30438] 
939987 [30439] The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something
939987 [30440] seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break his
939987 [30441] chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. At
939987 [30442] last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked
939987 [30443] round him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just
939987 [30444] thrown at his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one
939987 [30445] on the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on
939987 [30446] persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his
939987 [30447] dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
939987 [30448] 
939987 [30449] â€œIt was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened just
939987 [30450] now!â€ cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
939987 [30451] 
939987 [30452] â€œAlyosha, I told you not to come,â€ he cried fiercely to his brother. â€œIn
939987 [30453] two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?â€
939987 [30454] 
939987 [30455] â€œAn hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,â€ Alyosha answered from the yard.
939987 [30456] 
939987 [30457] â€œCome round to the steps, Iâ€™ll open at once,â€ said Ivan, going to open the
939987 [30458] door to Alyosha.
939987 [30459] 
939987 [30460] 
939987 [30461] 
939987 [30462] Chapter X. â€œIt Was He Who Said Thatâ€
939987 [30463] 
939987 [30464] 
939987 [30465] Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya
939987 [30466] Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken
939987 [30467] his own life. â€œI went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a
939987 [30468] nail in the wall.â€ On Alyoshaâ€™s inquiring whether she had informed the
939987 [30469] police, she answered that she had told no one, â€œbut I flew straight to
939987 [30470] you, Iâ€™ve run all the way.â€ She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported,
939987 [30471] and was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he
939987 [30472] found Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: â€œI destroy my
939987 [30473] life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.â€
939987 [30474] Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain
939987 [30475] and told him all about it. â€œAnd from him Iâ€™ve come straight to you,â€ said
939987 [30476] Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivanâ€™s face. He had not
939987 [30477] taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though struck by
939987 [30478] something in his expression.
939987 [30479] 
939987 [30480] â€œBrother,â€ he cried suddenly, â€œyou must be terribly ill. You look and
939987 [30481] donâ€™t seem to understand what I tell you.â€
939987 [30482] 
939987 [30483] â€œItâ€™s a good thing you came,â€ said Ivan, as though brooding, and not
939987 [30484] hearing Alyoshaâ€™s exclamation. â€œI knew he had hanged himself.â€
939987 [30485] 
939987 [30486] â€œFrom whom?â€
939987 [30487] 
939987 [30488] â€œI donâ€™t know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told me so just
939987 [30489] now.â€
939987 [30490] 
939987 [30491] Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same brooding
939987 [30492] tone, looking at the ground.
939987 [30493] 
939987 [30494] â€œWho is _he_?â€ asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
939987 [30495] 
939987 [30496] â€œHeâ€™s slipped away.â€
939987 [30497] 
939987 [30498] Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
939987 [30499] 
939987 [30500] â€œHe was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a â€˜pure cherub.â€™ Dmitri
939987 [30501] calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim.
939987 [30502] What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps that
939987 [30503] constellation is only a chemical molecule. Thereâ€™s a constellation of the
939987 [30504] Lion and the Sun. Donâ€™t you know it?â€
939987 [30505] 
939987 [30506] â€œBrother, sit down,â€ said Alyosha in alarm. â€œFor goodnessâ€™ sake, sit down
939987 [30507] on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow, thatâ€™s right.
939987 [30508] Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps it will do you good.â€
939987 [30509] 
939987 [30510] â€œGive me the towel: itâ€™s here on the chair. I just threw it down there.â€
939987 [30511] 
939987 [30512] â€œItâ€™s not here. Donâ€™t worry yourself. I know where it isâ€”here,â€ said
939987 [30513] Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivanâ€™s
939987 [30514] dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked strangely at
939987 [30515] the towel: recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant.
939987 [30516] 
939987 [30517] â€œStayâ€â€”he got up from the sofaâ€”â€œan hour ago I took that new towel from
939987 [30518] there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ...
939987 [30519] How is it itâ€™s dry? There was no other.â€
939987 [30520] 
939987 [30521] â€œYou put that towel on your head?â€ asked Alyosha.
939987 [30522] 
939987 [30523] â€œYes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles
939987 [30524] burnt down so? Whatâ€™s the time?â€
939987 [30525] 
939987 [30526] â€œNearly twelve.â€
939987 [30527] 
939987 [30528] â€œNo, no, no!â€ Ivan cried suddenly. â€œIt was not a dream. He was here; he
939987 [30529] was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw a
939987 [30530] glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but this
939987 [30531] dream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha
939987 [30532] ... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ...
939987 [30533] though I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is
939987 [30534] frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.â€ Ivan laughed suddenly
939987 [30535] and began pacing about the room.
939987 [30536] 
939987 [30537] â€œWho is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?â€ Alyosha asked anxiously
939987 [30538] again.
939987 [30539] 
939987 [30540] â€œThe devil! Heâ€™s taken to visiting me. Heâ€™s been here twice, almost three
939987 [30541] times. He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not
939987 [30542] Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning. But he is not Satan:
939987 [30543] thatâ€™s a lie. He is an impostor. He is simply a devilâ€”a paltry, trivial
939987 [30544] devil. He goes to the baths. If you undressed him, youâ€™d be sure to find
939987 [30545] he had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish dogâ€™s, a yard long, dun
939987 [30546] color.... Alyosha, you are cold. Youâ€™ve been in the snow. Would you like
939987 [30547] some tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some? _Câ€™est Ã  ne
939987 [30548] pas mettre un chien dehors._...â€
939987 [30549] 
939987 [30550] Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to sit
939987 [30551] down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He sat down beside him.
939987 [30552] 
939987 [30553] â€œWhat were you telling me just now about Lise?â€ Ivan began again. (He was
939987 [30554] becoming very talkative.) â€œI like Lise. I said something nasty about her.
939987 [30555] It was a lie. I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more
939987 [30556] afraid of her than of anything. On account of the future. She will cast me
939987 [30557] off to-morrow and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining
939987 [30558] Mitya from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But itâ€™s not so.
939987 [30559] To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shanâ€™t hang myself. Do you
939987 [30560] know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it because I am base? I am
939987 [30561] not a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that Smerdyakov had
939987 [30562] hanged himself? Yes, it was _he_ told me so.â€
939987 [30563] 
939987 [30564] â€œAnd you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?â€ asked
939987 [30565] Alyosha.
939987 [30566] 
939987 [30567] â€œYes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him away. You did
939987 [30568] drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I love your face,
939987 [30569] Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ is myself, Alyosha.
939987 [30570] All thatâ€™s base in me, all thatâ€™s mean and contemptible. Yes, I am a
939987 [30571] romantic. He guessed it ... though itâ€™s a libel. He is frightfully stupid;
939987 [30572] but itâ€™s to his advantage. He has cunning, animal cunningâ€”he knew how to
939987 [30573] infuriate me. He kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how
939987 [30574] he made me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great deal
939987 [30575] that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it to
939987 [30576] myself. Do you know, Alyosha,â€ Ivan added in an intensely earnest and
939987 [30577] confidential tone, â€œI should be awfully glad to think that it was _he_ and
939987 [30578] not I.â€
939987 [30579] 
939987 [30580] â€œHe has worn you out,â€ said Alyosha, looking compassionately at his
939987 [30581] brother.
939987 [30582] 
939987 [30583] â€œHeâ€™s been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so cleverly.
939987 [30584] â€˜Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why am I
939987 [30585] tormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind for the
939987 [30586] seven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we shall be gods.â€™ It was
939987 [30587] he said that, it was he said that!â€
939987 [30588] 
939987 [30589] â€œAnd not you, not you?â€ Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly at
939987 [30590] his brother. â€œNever mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him.
939987 [30591] And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!â€
939987 [30592] 
939987 [30593] â€œYes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,â€
939987 [30594] Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. â€œBut he was unfair to me, unfair to
939987 [30595] me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. â€˜Oh, you are
939987 [30596] going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your
939987 [30597] father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.â€™ â€
939987 [30598] 
939987 [30599] â€œBrother,â€ Alyosha interposed, â€œrestrain yourself. It was not you murdered
939987 [30600] him. Itâ€™s not true!â€
939987 [30601] 
939987 [30602] â€œThatâ€™s what he says, he, and he knows it. â€˜You are going to perform an
939987 [30603] act of heroic virtue, and you donâ€™t believe in virtue; thatâ€™s what
939987 [30604] tortures you and makes you angry, thatâ€™s why you are so vindictive.â€™ He
939987 [30605] said that to me about me and he knows what he says.â€
939987 [30606] 
939987 [30607] â€œItâ€™s you say that, not he,â€ exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, â€œand you say it
939987 [30608] because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.â€
939987 [30609] 
939987 [30610] â€œNo, he knows what he says. â€˜You are going from pride,â€™ he says. â€˜Youâ€™ll
939987 [30611] stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror?
939987 [30612] You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!â€™ He said
939987 [30613] that about me. â€˜And do you know you are longing for their praiseâ€”â€œhe is a
939987 [30614] criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his
939987 [30615] brother and he confessed.â€ â€™ Thatâ€™s a lie, Alyosha!â€ Ivan cried suddenly,
939987 [30616] with flashing eyes. â€œI donâ€™t want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I
939987 [30617] donâ€™t! Thatâ€™s a lie! Thatâ€™s why I threw the glass at him and it broke
939987 [30618] against his ugly face.â€
939987 [30619] 
939987 [30620] â€œBrother, calm yourself, stop!â€ Alyosha entreated him.
939987 [30621] 
939987 [30622] â€œYes, he knows how to torment one. Heâ€™s cruel,â€ Ivan went on, unheeding.
939987 [30623] â€œI had an inkling from the first what he came for. â€˜Granting that you go
939987 [30624] through pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and
939987 [30625] sent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while you would only be
939987 [30626] punished with moral condemnationâ€™ (â€˜Do you hear?â€™ he laughed then)â€”â€˜and
939987 [30627] some people will praise you. But now Smerdyakovâ€™s dead, he has hanged
939987 [30628] himself, and whoâ€™ll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are
939987 [30629] going, youâ€™ll go all the same, youâ€™ve decided to go. What are you going
939987 [30630] for now?â€™ Thatâ€™s awful, Alyosha. I canâ€™t endure such questions. Who dare
939987 [30631] ask me such questions?â€
939987 [30632] 
939987 [30633] â€œBrother,â€ interposed Alyoshaâ€”his heart sank with terror, but he still
939987 [30634] seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reasonâ€”â€œhow could he have told you of
939987 [30635] Smerdyakovâ€™s death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was no
939987 [30636] time for any one to know of it?â€
939987 [30637] 
939987 [30638] â€œHe told me,â€ said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. â€œIt was all he
939987 [30639] did talk about, if you come to that. â€˜And it would be all right if you
939987 [30640] believed in virtue,â€™ he said. â€˜No matter if they disbelieve you, you are
939987 [30641] going for the sake of principle. But you are a little pig like Fyodor
939987 [30642] Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to go
939987 [30643] meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you donâ€™t know
939987 [30644] yourself why you go! Oh, youâ€™d give a great deal to know yourself why you
939987 [30645] go! And can you have made up your mind? Youâ€™ve not made up your mind.
939987 [30646] Youâ€™ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;
939987 [30647] you know youâ€™ll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decision
939987 [30648] does not depend on you. Youâ€™ll go because you wonâ€™t dare not to go. Why
939987 [30649] wonâ€™t you dare? You must guess that for yourself. Thatâ€™s a riddle for
939987 [30650] you!â€™ He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me a
939987 [30651] coward, Alyosha! _Le mot de lâ€™Ã©nigme_ is that I am a coward. â€˜It is not
939987 [30652] for such eagles to soar above the earth.â€™ It was he added thatâ€”he! And
939987 [30653] Smerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. Iâ€™ve seen
939987 [30654] that for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! â€˜You are going
939987 [30655] in order to be praised.â€™ Thatâ€™s a brutal lie! And you despise me too,
939987 [30656] Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I
939987 [30657] hate the monster! I donâ€™t want to save the monster. Let him rot in
939987 [30658] Siberia! Heâ€™s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow Iâ€™ll go, stand before
939987 [30659] them, and spit in their faces!â€
939987 [30660] 
939987 [30661] He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and
939987 [30662] down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. â€œI seem to be
939987 [30663] sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.â€ It seemed to
939987 [30664] be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed
939987 [30665] through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his
939987 [30666] brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees
939987 [30667] Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking,
939987 [30668] talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his
939987 [30669] words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in
939987 [30670] time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed
939987 [30671] him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two
939987 [30672] hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and
939987 [30673] evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without
939987 [30674] undressing.
939987 [30675] 
939987 [30676] As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand
939987 [30677] Ivanâ€™s illness. â€œThe anguish of a proud determination. An earnest
939987 [30678] conscience!â€ God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining
939987 [30679] mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. â€œYes,â€ the thought
939987 [30680] floated through Alyoshaâ€™s head as it lay on the pillow, â€œyes, if
939987 [30681] Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivanâ€™s evidence; but he will go
939987 [30682] and give it.â€ Alyosha smiled softly. â€œGod will conquer!â€ he thought. â€œHe
939987 [30683] will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... heâ€™ll perish in hate,
939987 [30684] revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does
939987 [30685] not believe in,â€ Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.

939987 [30694] Chapter I. The Fatal Day
939987 [30695] 
939987 [30696] 
939987 [30697] At ten oâ€™clock in the morning of the day following the events I have
939987 [30698] described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.
939987 [30699] 
939987 [30700] I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable
939987 [30701] of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in
939987 [30702] the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full
939987 [30703] explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I
939987 [30704] may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have
939987 [30705] selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may
939987 [30706] have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall
939987 [30707] do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for
939987 [30708] himself that I have done all I can.
939987 [30709] 
939987 [30710] And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what
939987 [30711] surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was
939987 [30712] surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great
939987 [30713] interest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to
939987 [30714] begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and
939987 [30715] surmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too,
939987 [30716] that the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not
939987 [30717] imagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every
939987 [30718] one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident at
939987 [30719] the trial this day.
939987 [30720] 
939987 [30721] Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, but
939987 [30722] from several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and Petersburg.
939987 [30723] Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguished
939987 [30724] personages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched up. A special
939987 [30725] place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the
939987 [30726] most distinguished and important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs
939987 [30727] had been placed thereâ€”something exceptional, which had never been allowed
939987 [30728] before. A large proportionâ€”not less than half of the publicâ€”were ladies.
939987 [30729] There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not
939987 [30730] know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since been eagerly
939987 [30731] sought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the room, behind the
939987 [30732] platform, a special partition hurriedly put up, behind which all these
939987 [30733] lawyers were admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standing
939987 [30734] room there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space, and the
939987 [30735] crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed,
939987 [30736] shoulder to shoulder.
939987 [30737] 
939987 [30738] Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made their
939987 [30739] appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority of the
939987 [30740] ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed hysterical,
939987 [30741] intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar factâ€”established afterwards
939987 [30742] by many observationsâ€”was that almost all the ladies, or, at least the vast
939987 [30743] majority of them, were on Mityaâ€™s side and in favor of his being
939987 [30744] acquitted. This was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror
939987 [30745] of female hearts. It was known that two women rivals were to appear in the
939987 [30746] case. One of themâ€”Katerina Ivanovnaâ€”was an object of general interest. All
939987 [30747] sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes of her
939987 [30748] passion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and â€œaristocratic
939987 [30749] connectionsâ€ were particularly insisted upon (she had called upon scarcely
939987 [30750] any one in the town). People said she intended to petition the Government
939987 [30751] for leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him
939987 [30752] somewhere in the mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited
939987 [30753] with no less impatience. The public was looking forward with anxious
939987 [30754] curiosity to the meeting of the two rivalsâ€”the proud aristocratic girl and
939987 [30755] â€œthe hetaira.â€ But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of
939987 [30756] the district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen â€œthe woman who
939987 [30757] had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,â€ and all, almost without
939987 [30758] exception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with â€œsuch a
939987 [30759] very common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.â€
939987 [30760] 
939987 [30761] In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that there
939987 [30762] were several serious family quarrels on Mityaâ€™s account in our town. Many
939987 [30763] ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion
939987 [30764] about the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the husbands of
939987 [30765] these ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner, should
939987 [30766] enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him. In fact, one may say
939987 [30767] pretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine,
939987 [30768] part of the audience were biased against the prisoner. There were numbers
939987 [30769] of severe, frowning, even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to
939987 [30770] offend many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,
939987 [30771] of course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of
939987 [30772] Mitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the majority
939987 [30773] of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal,
939987 [30774] except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than in
939987 [30775] the moral aspect of the case.
939987 [30776] 
939987 [30777] Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,
939987 [30778] Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first time
939987 [30779] he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And if he
939987 [30780] defended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over
939987 [30781] Russia. There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about the
939987 [30782] President of the Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a
939987 [30783] tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from the
939987 [30784] beginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitive
939987 [30785] prosecutor, who always considered that he had been aggrieved by some one
939987 [30786] in Petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated, was
939987 [30787] keenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of
939987 [30788] rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,
939987 [30789] was his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutor
939987 [30790] was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the
939987 [30791] contrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase of danger. It
939987 [30792] must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly
939987 [30793] impressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case and work at it
939987 [30794] as though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result.
939987 [30795] This was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this
939987 [30796] characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have
939987 [30797] been expected from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his
939987 [30798] passion for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor
939987 [30799] was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed.
939987 [30800] But with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset
939987 [30801] of his career and had never made up for it later.
939987 [30802] 
939987 [30803] As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a humane and
939987 [30804] cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressive
939987 [30805] views. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself greatly about
939987 [30806] his future career. The great aim of his life was to be a man of advanced
939987 [30807] ideas. He was, too, a man of connections and property. He felt, as we
939987 [30808] learnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a
939987 [30809] social, not from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a
939987 [30810] social phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product of
939987 [30811] our social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on,
939987 [30812] and so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic
939987 [30813] significance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner, was
939987 [30814] rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.
939987 [30815] 
939987 [30816] The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their
939987 [30817] appearance. Our court is the best hall in the townâ€”spacious, lofty, and
939987 [30818] good for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on a raised platform,
939987 [30819] a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury. On the
939987 [30820] left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense. In
939987 [30821] the middle of the court, near the judges, was a table with the â€œmaterial
939987 [30822] proofs.â€ On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s white silk dressing-gown, stained
939987 [30823] with blood; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been
939987 [30824] committed; Mityaâ€™s shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat, stained
939987 [30825] with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put his
939987 [30826] handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by now quite
939987 [30827] yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotinâ€™s with a view to suicide,
939987 [30828] and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the
939987 [30829] envelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for
939987 [30830] Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied, and many
939987 [30831] other articles I donâ€™t remember. In the body of the hall, at some
939987 [30832] distance, came the seats for the public. But in front of the balustrade a
939987 [30833] few chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after
939987 [30834] giving their evidence.
939987 [30835] 
939987 [30836] At ten oâ€™clock the three judges arrivedâ€”the President, one honorary
939987 [30837] justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, entered
939987 [30838] immediately after. The President was a short, stout, thick-set man of
939987 [30839] fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut short,
939987 [30840] and a red ribbon, of what Order I donâ€™t remember. The prosecutor struck me
939987 [30841] and the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost green. His face
939987 [30842] seemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I
939987 [30843] had seen him looking as usual only two days before. The President began
939987 [30844] with asking the court whether all the jury were present.
939987 [30845] 
939987 [30846] But I see I canâ€™t go on like this, partly because some things I did not
939987 [30847] hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most of
939987 [30848] all because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space to
939987 [30849] mention everything that was said and done. I only know that neither side
939987 [30850] objected to very many of the jurymen. I remember the twelve jurymenâ€”four
939987 [30851] were petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and six peasants and
939987 [30852] artisans of the town. I remember, long before the trial, questions were
939987 [30853] continually asked with some surprise, especially by ladies: â€œCan such a
939987 [30854] delicate, complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to
939987 [30855] petty officials and even peasants?â€ and â€œWhat can an official, still more
939987 [30856] a peasant, understand in such an affair?â€ All the four officials in the
939987 [30857] jury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one who
939987 [30858] was rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in society,
939987 [30859] who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly,
939987 [30860] unpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and
939987 [30861] stockings. At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of course,
939987 [30862] had never read a single book. The two merchants looked respectable, but
939987 [30863] were strangely silent and stolid. One of them was close-shaven, and was
939987 [30864] dressed in European style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a
939987 [30865] red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need
939987 [30866] to speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans of
939987 [30867] Skotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of
939987 [30868] them also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier
939987 [30869] and more uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might well
939987 [30870] wonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, â€œwhat men like that
939987 [30871] could possibly make of such a case?â€ Yet their faces made a strangely
939987 [30872] imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and frowning.
939987 [30873] 
939987 [30874] At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [30875] Karamazov. I donâ€™t quite remember how he described him. The court usher
939987 [30876] was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his appearance. There
939987 [30877] was a hush through the court. One could have heard a fly. I donâ€™t know how
939987 [30878] it was with others, but Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He
939987 [30879] looked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that
939987 [30880] he had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own
939987 [30881] tailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves and
939987 [30882] exquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking stiffly
939987 [30883] straight in front of him, and sat down in his place with a most
939987 [30884] unperturbed air.
939987 [30885] 
939987 [30886] At the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated Fetyukovitch,
939987 [30887] entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court. He was a
939987 [30888] tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely long, thin, pale
939987 [30889] fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, rather short hair, and thin
939987 [30890] lips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile.
939987 [30891] He looked about forty. His face would have been pleasant, if it had not
939987 [30892] been for his eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set
939987 [30893] remarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing
939987 [30894] line between them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about
939987 [30895] his face. He was in evening dress and white tie.
939987 [30896] 
939987 [30897] I remember the Presidentâ€™s first questions to Mitya, about his name, his
939987 [30898] calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was so
939987 [30899] unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the
939987 [30900] prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to take
939987 [30901] part in the proceedingsâ€”that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was a
939987 [30902] long list. Four of the witnesses were not presentâ€”MiÃ¼sov, who had given
939987 [30903] evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov
939987 [30904] and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his
939987 [30905] sudden death, of which an official statement from the police was
939987 [30906] presented. The news of Smerdyakovâ€™s death produced a sudden stir and
939987 [30907] whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of
939987 [30908] the sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mityaâ€™s sudden outburst As
939987 [30909] soon as the statement of Smerdyakovâ€™s death was made, he cried out aloud
939987 [30910] from his place:
939987 [30911] 
939987 [30912] â€œHe was a dog and died like a dog!â€
939987 [30913] 
939987 [30914] I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President addressed
939987 [30915] him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity were
939987 [30916] repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times
939987 [30917] abruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret:
939987 [30918] 
939987 [30919] â€œI wonâ€™t again, I wonâ€™t. It escaped me. I wonâ€™t do it again.â€
939987 [30920] 
939987 [30921] And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the
939987 [30922] public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was under
939987 [30923] the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read. It was
939987 [30924] rather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he
939987 [30925] had been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great
939987 [30926] impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole
939987 [30927] tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in
939987 [30928] a fatal and pitiless light. I remember how, immediately after it had been
939987 [30929] read, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:
939987 [30930] 
939987 [30931] â€œPrisoner, do you plead guilty?â€
939987 [30932] 
939987 [30933] Mitya suddenly rose from his seat.
939987 [30934] 
939987 [30935] â€œI plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,â€ he exclaimed, again in a
939987 [30936] startling, almost frenzied, voice, â€œto idleness and debauchery. I meant to
939987 [30937] become an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck down
939987 [30938] by fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and my
939987 [30939] father. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri
939987 [30940] Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.â€
939987 [30941] 
939987 [30942] He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President again
939987 [30943] briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was asked,
939987 [30944] and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered the case
939987 [30945] to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I saw
939987 [30946] them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to
939987 [30947] give evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from the
939987 [30948] priest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit
939987 [30949] as far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them up
939987 [30950] one by one.
939987 [30951] 
939987 [30952] 
939987 [30953] 
939987 [30954] Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses
939987 [30955] 
939987 [30956] 
939987 [30957] I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the
939987 [30958] prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it
939987 [30959] was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. I
939987 [30960] only know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first. I
939987 [30961] repeat I donâ€™t intend to describe all the questions step by step. Besides,
939987 [30962] my account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the speeches
939987 [30963] for the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidence
939987 [30964] was brought together and set in a strong and significant light, and I took
939987 [30965] down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them
939987 [30966] in due course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected
939987 [30967] episode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly
939987 [30968] influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.
939987 [30969] 
939987 [30970] I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar
939987 [30971] characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all, that is,
939987 [30972] the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the
939987 [30973] arguments the defense had to rely upon. Every one realized it from the
939987 [30974] first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single
939987 [30975] point, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed.
939987 [30976] Every one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute,
939987 [30977] that there was no doubt about it, that there could be really no
939987 [30978] discussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form, and that the
939987 [30979] prisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine that
939987 [30980] even the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the
939987 [30981] interesting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convinced
939987 [30982] of his guilt. Whatâ€™s more, I believe they would have been mortified if his
939987 [30983] guilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened the
939987 [30984] effect of the closing scene of the criminalâ€™s acquittal. That he would be
939987 [30985] acquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the
939987 [30986] very last moment. â€œHe is guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives of
939987 [30987] humanity, in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had
939987 [30988] come into fashion,â€ and so on, and so on. And that was why they had
939987 [30989] crowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested in the
939987 [30990] contest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All were
939987 [30991] wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like
939987 [30992] Fetyukovitchâ€™s make of such a desperate case; and so they followed his
939987 [30993] achievements, step by step, with concentrated attention.
939987 [30994] 
939987 [30995] But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to his
939987 [30996] speech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some design, that he
939987 [30997] was working towards some object, but it was almost impossible to guess
939987 [30998] what it was. His confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable, however.
939987 [30999] Every one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that he, after so short a stay,
939987 [31000] not more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded
939987 [31001] in mastering the case and â€œhad studied it to a nicety.â€ People described
939987 [31002] with relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had â€œtaken downâ€ all the
939987 [31003] witnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and,
939987 [31004] whatâ€™s more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of
939987 [31005] their evidence. But it was supposed that he did this rather by way of
939987 [31006] sport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had been
939987 [31007] omitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he could do
939987 [31008] no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was more
939987 [31009] aware of this than any one, having some idea of his own in the background,
939987 [31010] some concealed weapon of defense, which he would suddenly reveal when the
939987 [31011] time came. But meanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed to be
939987 [31012] diverting himself.
939987 [31013] 
939987 [31014] So, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™s old servant, who had
939987 [31015] given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, was
939987 [31016] examined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him when
939987 [31017] his turn came to question him. It must be noted that Grigory entered the
939987 [31018] hall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least disconcerted by
939987 [31019] the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him. He gave
939987 [31020] evidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with his
939987 [31021] Marfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was impossible to make him
939987 [31022] contradict himself. The prosecutor questioned him first in detail about
939987 [31023] the family life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid
939987 [31024] colors. It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and
939987 [31025] impartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his
939987 [31026] deceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to Mitya and
939987 [31027] â€œhadnâ€™t brought up his children as he should. Heâ€™d have been devoured by
939987 [31028] lice when he was little, if it hadnâ€™t been for me,â€ he added, describing
939987 [31029] Mityaâ€™s early childhood. â€œIt wasnâ€™t fair either of the father to wrong his
939987 [31030] son over his motherâ€™s property, which was by right his.â€
939987 [31031] 
939987 [31032] In reply to the prosecutorâ€™s question what grounds he had for asserting
939987 [31033] that Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money relations,
939987 [31034] Grigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bring
939987 [31035] forward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son was
939987 [31036] â€œunfair,â€ and that he ought â€œto have paid him several thousand roubles
939987 [31037] more.â€ I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this question
939987 [31038] whether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mityaâ€™s inheritance
939987 [31039] with marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, not
939987 [31040] excepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact information from any
939987 [31041] one; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring forward any
939987 [31042] distinct proof. Grigoryâ€™s description of the scene at the dinner-table,
939987 [31043] when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father, threatening to come back
939987 [31044] to kill him, made a sinister impression on the court, especially as the
939987 [31045] old servantâ€™s composure in telling it, his parsimony of words and peculiar
939987 [31046] phraseology, were as effective as eloquence. He observed that he was not
939987 [31047] angry with Mitya for having knocked him down and struck him on the face;
939987 [31048] he had forgiven him long ago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov he
939987 [31049] observed, crossing himself, that he was a lad of ability, but stupid and
939987 [31050] afflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [31051] and his elder son who had taught him to be so. But he defended
939987 [31052] Smerdyakovâ€™s honesty almost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had
939987 [31053] once found the masterâ€™s money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it,
939987 [31054] had taken it to his master, who had rewarded him with a â€œgold pieceâ€ for
939987 [31055] it, and trusted him implicitly from that time forward. He maintained
939987 [31056] obstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he was asked
939987 [31057] so many questions that I canâ€™t recall them all.
939987 [31058] 
939987 [31059] At last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him, and the
939987 [31060] first question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [31061] was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for â€œa certain person.â€
939987 [31062] â€œHave you ever seen it, you, who were for so many years in close
939987 [31063] attendance on your master?â€ Grigory answered that he had not seen it and
939987 [31064] had never heard of the money from any one â€œtill everybody was talking
939987 [31065] about it.â€ This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every one
939987 [31066] who could conceivably have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor
939987 [31067] asked his question about Dmitriâ€™s inheritance, and got the same answer
939987 [31068] from all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.
939987 [31069] From the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitchâ€™s persistence on this
939987 [31070] subject.
939987 [31071] 
939987 [31072] â€œNow, with your permission Iâ€™ll ask you a question,â€ Fetyukovitch said,
939987 [31073] suddenly and unexpectedly. â€œOf what was that balsam, or, rather,
939987 [31074] decoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you used
939987 [31075] on that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?â€
939987 [31076] 
939987 [31077] Grigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence
939987 [31078] muttered, â€œThere was saffron in it.â€
939987 [31079] 
939987 [31080] â€œNothing but saffron? Donâ€™t you remember any other ingredient?â€
939987 [31081] 
939987 [31082] â€œThere was milfoil in it, too.â€
939987 [31083] 
939987 [31084] â€œAnd pepper perhaps?â€ Fetyukovitch queried.
939987 [31085] 
939987 [31086] â€œYes, there was pepper, too.â€
939987 [31087] 
939987 [31088] â€œEtcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?â€
939987 [31089] 
939987 [31090] â€œIn spirit.â€
939987 [31091] 
939987 [31092] There was a faint sound of laughter in the court.
939987 [31093] 
939987 [31094] â€œYou see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank what
939987 [31095] was left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to your
939987 [31096] wife?â€
939987 [31097] 
939987 [31098] â€œI did.â€
939987 [31099] 
939987 [31100] â€œDid you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?â€
939987 [31101] 
939987 [31102] â€œIt might have been a tumbler-full.â€
939987 [31103] 
939987 [31104] â€œA tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?â€
939987 [31105] 
939987 [31106] Grigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.
939987 [31107] 
939987 [31108] â€œA glass and a half of neat spiritâ€”is not at all bad, donâ€™t you think? You
939987 [31109] might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?â€
939987 [31110] 
939987 [31111] Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The
939987 [31112] President made a movement.
939987 [31113] 
939987 [31114] â€œDo you know for a fact,â€ Fetyukovitch persisted, â€œwhether you were awake
939987 [31115] or not when you saw the open door?â€
939987 [31116] 
939987 [31117] â€œI was on my legs.â€
939987 [31118] 
939987 [31119] â€œThatâ€™s not a proof that you were awake.â€ (There was again laughter in the
939987 [31120] court.) â€œCould you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you
939987 [31121] a questionâ€”for instance, what year it is?â€
939987 [31122] 
939987 [31123] â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
939987 [31124] 
939987 [31125] â€œAnd what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?â€
939987 [31126] 
939987 [31127] Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.
939987 [31128] Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was.
939987 [31129] 
939987 [31130] â€œBut perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?â€
939987 [31131] 
939987 [31132] â€œI am a servant,â€ Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. â€œIf
939987 [31133] my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.â€
939987 [31134] 
939987 [31135] Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,
939987 [31136] reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowed
939987 [31137] with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness.
939987 [31138] The public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt in
939987 [31139] their minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a
939987 [31140] certain cure, have seen â€œthe gates of heaven,â€ and who did not even know
939987 [31141] what year he was living in. But before Grigory left the box another
939987 [31142] episode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him
939987 [31143] whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.
939987 [31144] 
939987 [31145] â€œExcept about the door, all he has said is true,â€ cried Mitya, in a loud
939987 [31146] voice. â€œFor combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my blows,
939987 [31147] I thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to
939987 [31148] my father as seven hundred poodles.â€
939987 [31149] 
939987 [31150] â€œPrisoner, be careful in your language,â€ the President admonished him.
939987 [31151] 
939987 [31152] â€œI am not a poodle,â€ Grigory muttered.
939987 [31153] 
939987 [31154] â€œAll right, itâ€™s I am a poodle myself,â€ cried Mitya. â€œIf itâ€™s an insult, I
939987 [31155] take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. I
939987 [31156] was cruel to Ã†sop too.â€
939987 [31157] 
939987 [31158] â€œWhat Ã†sop?â€ the President asked sternly again.
939987 [31159] 
939987 [31160] â€œOh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.â€
939987 [31161] 
939987 [31162] The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly
939987 [31163] to be more careful in his language.
939987 [31164] 
939987 [31165] â€œYou are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.â€
939987 [31166] 
939987 [31167] The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the
939987 [31168] evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading
939987 [31169] witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. It
939987 [31170] appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had been
939987 [31171] everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the
939987 [31172] biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it
939987 [31173] is true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely
939987 [31174] Mityaâ€™s exploits in the â€œMetropolis,â€ all his compromising doings and
939987 [31175] sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryovâ€™s â€œwisp of tow.â€ But even
939987 [31176] Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mityaâ€™s inheritance, and confined
939987 [31177] himself to contemptuous generalities.
939987 [31178] 
939987 [31179] â€œWho could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to the
939987 [31180] other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one
939987 [31181] could make head or tail of it?â€ He attributed the tragic crime to the
939987 [31182] habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed
939987 [31183] condition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions. He was,
939987 [31184] in fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This was the first occasion on
939987 [31185] which Rakitin showed what he could do, and attracted notice. The
939987 [31186] prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the
939987 [31187] case, and afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some
939987 [31188] ideas from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The picture
939987 [31189] drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly
939987 [31190] strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitinâ€™s discourse
939987 [31191] fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility
939987 [31192] of its ideas. There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he
939987 [31193] spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia.
939987 [31194] 
939987 [31195] But Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which the
939987 [31196] counsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage. Answering certain
939987 [31197] questions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of his own
939987 [31198] sentiments and his success, of which he was, of course, conscious, he went
939987 [31199] so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as
939987 [31200] â€œthe kept mistress of Samsonov.â€ He would have given a good deal to take
939987 [31201] back his words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at
939987 [31202] once. And it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having
939987 [31203] been able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so short
939987 [31204] a time.
939987 [31205] 
939987 [31206] â€œAllow me to ask,â€ began the counsel for the defense, with the most
939987 [31207] affable and even respectful smile, â€œyou are, of course, the same Mr.
939987 [31208] Rakitin whose pamphlet, _The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father Zossima_,
939987 [31209] published by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and religious
939987 [31210] reflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to the
939987 [31211] bishop, I have just read with such pleasure?â€
939987 [31212] 
939987 [31213] â€œI did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,â€
939987 [31214] muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost
939987 [31215] ashamed.
939987 [31216] 
939987 [31217] â€œOh, thatâ€™s excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to, take
939987 [31218] the widest view of every social question. Your most instructive pamphlet
939987 [31219] has been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop, and has
939987 [31220] been of appreciable service.... But this is the chief thing I should like
939987 [31221] to learn from you. You stated just now that you were very intimately
939987 [31222] acquainted with Madame Svyetlov.â€ (It must be noted that Grushenkaâ€™s
939987 [31223] surname was Svyetlov. I heard it for the first time that day, during the
939987 [31224] case.)
939987 [31225] 
939987 [31226] â€œI cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and who
939987 [31227] can be responsible for every one he meets?â€ cried Rakitin, flushing all
939987 [31228] over.
939987 [31229] 
939987 [31230] â€œI understand, I quite understand,â€ cried Fetyukovitch, as though he, too,
939987 [31231] were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. â€œYou, like any other,
939987 [31232] might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautiful
939987 [31233] woman who would readily entertain the _Ã©lite_ of the youth of the
939987 [31234] neighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ... It has come to my
939987 [31235] knowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of months
939987 [31236] ago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey
939987 [31237] Fyodorovitch, and promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him
939987 [31238] to her in his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the evening
939987 [31239] of the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the
939987 [31240] present investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov to
939987 [31241] Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from Madame
939987 [31242] Svyetlov as a reward, thatâ€™s what I wanted to hear from you?â€
939987 [31243] 
939987 [31244] â€œIt was a joke.... I donâ€™t see of what interest that can be to you.... I
939987 [31245] took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later....â€
939987 [31246] 
939987 [31247] â€œThen you did takeâ€” But you have not given it back yet ... or have you?â€
939987 [31248] 
939987 [31249] â€œThatâ€™s of no consequence,â€ muttered Rakitin, â€œI refuse to answer such
939987 [31250] questions.... Of course I shall give it back.â€
939987 [31251] 
939987 [31252] The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no more
939987 [31253] questions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box not
939987 [31254] absolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect left by the
939987 [31255] lofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitchâ€™s
939987 [31256] expression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to suggest to the public
939987 [31257] â€œthis is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons who accuse him.â€ I
939987 [31258] remember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreak
939987 [31259] from Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to
939987 [31260] Grushenka, he suddenly shouted â€œBernard!â€ When, after Rakitinâ€™s
939987 [31261] cross-examination, the President asked the prisoner if he had anything to
939987 [31262] say, Mitya cried loudly:
939987 [31263] 
939987 [31264] â€œSince Iâ€™ve been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is a
939987 [31265] contemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesnâ€™t believe in God; he
939987 [31266] took the bishop in!â€
939987 [31267] 
939987 [31268] Mitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his
939987 [31269] language, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryovâ€™s evidence was a
939987 [31270] failure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared in ragged and
939987 [31271] dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and expert
939987 [31272] observation of the police officers, he turned out to be hopelessly drunk.
939987 [31273] On being asked about Mityaâ€™s attack upon him, he refused to answer.
939987 [31274] 
939987 [31275] â€œGod bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me yonder.â€
939987 [31276] 
939987 [31277] â€œWho told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?â€
939987 [31278] 
939987 [31279] â€œIlusha, my little son. â€˜Father, father, how he insulted you!â€™ He said
939987 [31280] that at the stone. Now he is dying....â€
939987 [31281] 
939987 [31282] The captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his knees before
939987 [31283] the President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of the
939987 [31284] public. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all.
939987 [31285] 
939987 [31286] Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazed
939987 [31287] people more and more by his minute knowledge of the case. Thus, for
939987 [31288] example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, very
939987 [31289] prejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his fingers that on his
939987 [31290] first visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles, â€œor
939987 [31291] very little less. Just think what he squandered on those gypsy girls
939987 [31292] alone! And as for our lousy peasants, it wasnâ€™t a case of flinging half a
939987 [31293] rouble in the street, he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each,
939987 [31294] at least, he didnâ€™t give them less. And what a lot of money was simply
939987 [31295] stolen from him! And if any one did steal, he did not leave a receipt. How
939987 [31296] could one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the
939987 [31297] time? Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for their
939987 [31298] souls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village girls! Theyâ€™re
939987 [31299] completely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be poor.â€ He
939987 [31300] recalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all up. So the
939987 [31301] theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been put
939987 [31302] aside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.
939987 [31303] 
939987 [31304] â€œI saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it with my
939987 [31305] own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,â€ cried
939987 [31306] Trifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy â€œhis betters.â€
939987 [31307] 
939987 [31308] When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried to refute
939987 [31309] his evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal
939987 [31310] at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another peasant
939987 [31311] called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles
939987 [31312] dropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and had given them to Trifon
939987 [31313] Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so. â€œWell,â€
939987 [31314] asked the lawyer, â€œdid you give that hundred roubles back to Mr.
939987 [31315] Karamazov?â€ Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain.... He was obliged, after
939987 [31316] the peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundred
939987 [31317] roubles, only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri
939987 [31318] Fyodorovitch â€œin perfect honesty, and itâ€™s only because his honor was in
939987 [31319] liquor at the time, he wouldnâ€™t remember it.â€ But, as he had denied the
939987 [31320] incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove
939987 [31321] it, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded
939987 [31322] with great suspicion. So one of the most dangerous witnesses brought
939987 [31323] forward by the prosecution was again discredited.
939987 [31324] 
939987 [31325] The same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude of pride
939987 [31326] and independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the
939987 [31327] service of the Crown, and that â€œPan Mityaâ€ had offered them three thousand
939987 [31328] â€œto buy their honor,â€ and that they had seen a large sum of money in his
939987 [31329] hands. Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words into
939987 [31330] his sentences, and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the
939987 [31331] eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, and
939987 [31332] ended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch caught them, too,
939987 [31333] in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was forced, in spite of his
939987 [31334] evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack of
939987 [31335] cards for the one he had provided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated
939987 [31336] during the game. Kalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left the
939987 [31337] witness-box with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
939987 [31338] 
939987 [31339] Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous
939987 [31340] witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, and
939987 [31341] dismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers and experts were lost
939987 [31342] in admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose
939987 [31343] could be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case for the
939987 [31344] prosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more tragically
939987 [31345] overwhelming. But from the confidence of the â€œgreat magicianâ€ they saw
939987 [31346] that he was serene, and they waited, feeling that â€œsuch a manâ€ had not
939987 [31347] come from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return
939987 [31348] unsuccessful.
939987 [31349] 
939987 [31350] 
939987 [31351] 
939987 [31352] Chapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts
939987 [31353] 
939987 [31354] 
939987 [31355] The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the
939987 [31356] prisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much
939987 [31357] upon it. The medical line of defense had only been taken up through the
939987 [31358] insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor from
939987 [31359] Moscow on purpose. The case for the defense could, of course, lose nothing
939987 [31360] by it and might, with luck, gain something from it. There was, however, an
939987 [31361] element of comedy about it, through the difference of opinion of the
939987 [31362] doctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our
939987 [31363] doctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two latter
939987 [31364] appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.
939987 [31365] 
939987 [31366] The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube.
939987 [31367] He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdy
939987 [31368] build. He was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town. He was
939987 [31369] a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or
939987 [31370] Moravian brother, I am not quite sure which. He had been living amongst us
939987 [31371] for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted
939987 [31372] and humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited
939987 [31373] them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he was as
939987 [31374] obstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into his head, there was
939987 [31375] no shaking it. Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, that
939987 [31376] the famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his presence
939987 [31377] among us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor
939987 [31378] Herzenstubeâ€™s qualifications. Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five
939987 [31379] roubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to take
939987 [31380] advantage of his arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense.
939987 [31381] All these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube,
939987 [31382] and the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme
939987 [31383] harshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them,
939987 [31384] â€œWell, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube? He, he!â€
939987 [31385] Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three
939987 [31386] doctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined.
939987 [31387] 
939987 [31388] Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisonerâ€™s
939987 [31389] mental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his grounds for this
939987 [31390] opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was not only
939987 [31391] evident in many of the prisonerâ€™s actions in the past, but was apparent
939987 [31392] even now at this very moment. When he was asked to explain how it was
939987 [31393] apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple-hearted
939987 [31394] directness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had â€œan
939987 [31395] extraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstancesâ€; that he had â€œmarched
939987 [31396] in like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it would have been
939987 [31397] more natural for him to look to the left where, among the public, the
939987 [31398] ladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex
939987 [31399] and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,â€ the
939987 [31400] old man concluded in his peculiar language.
939987 [31401] 
939987 [31402] I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed in
939987 [31403] German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always been
939987 [31404] a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly, better
939987 [31405] indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs,
939987 [31406] always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most
939987 [31407] expressive sayings in the whole world. I may remark, too, that in
939987 [31408] conversation, through absent-mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary
939987 [31409] words, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew them
939987 [31410] perfectly. The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German, and at
939987 [31411] such times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to
939987 [31412] catch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he
939987 [31413] had found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to have
939987 [31414] looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the
939987 [31415] audience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too,
939987 [31416] that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary
939987 [31417] conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures. And so his unexpected
939987 [31418] observation struck every one as very queer.
939987 [31419] 
939987 [31420] The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and
939987 [31421] emphatically repeated that he considered the prisonerâ€™s mental condition
939987 [31422] abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and with erudition of
939987 [31423] â€œaberrationâ€ and â€œmania,â€ and argued that, from all the facts collected,
939987 [31424] the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several
939987 [31425] days before his arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him, it
939987 [31426] must, even if he were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he
939987 [31427] had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.
939987 [31428] 
939987 [31429] But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which
939987 [31430] premised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (It
939987 [31431] must be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use of
939987 [31432] very learned and professional language.) â€œAll his actions are in
939987 [31433] contravention of common sense and logic,â€ he continued. â€œNot to refer to
939987 [31434] what I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole catastrophe,
939987 [31435] the day before yesterday, while he was talking to me, he had an
939987 [31436] unaccountably fixed look in his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there
939987 [31437] was nothing to laugh at. He showed continual and inexplicable
939987 [31438] irritability, using strange words, â€˜Bernard!â€™ â€˜Ethics!â€™ and others equally
939987 [31439] inappropriate.â€ But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that
939987 [31440] the prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which
939987 [31441] he considered himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary
939987 [31442] irritation, though he could speak comparatively lightly of other
939987 [31443] misfortunes and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in the
939987 [31444] past, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on,
939987 [31445] flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to be a disinterested
939987 [31446] and not grasping man.
939987 [31447] 
939987 [31448] â€œAs to the opinion of my learned colleague,â€ the Moscow doctor added
939987 [31449] ironically in conclusion, â€œthat the prisoner would, on entering the court,
939987 [31450] have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him, I will
939987 [31451] only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radically
939987 [31452] unsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on entering the court
939987 [31453] where his fate will be decided, would not naturally look straight before
939987 [31454] him in that fixed way, and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal
939987 [31455] mental condition, at the same time I maintain that he would naturally not
939987 [31456] look to the left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to find
939987 [31457] his legal adviser, on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defense
939987 [31458] all his future depends.â€ The doctor expressed his opinion positively and
939987 [31459] emphatically.
939987 [31460] 
939987 [31461] But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch
939987 [31462] of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts. In his opinion
939987 [31463] the prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a perfectly normal
939987 [31464] condition, and, although he certainly must have been in a nervous and
939987 [31465] exceedingly excited state before his arrest, this might have been due to
939987 [31466] several perfectly obvious causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness,
939987 [31467] and so on. But this nervous condition would not involve the mental
939987 [31468] aberration of which mention had just been made. As to the question whether
939987 [31469] the prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering
939987 [31470] the court, â€œin his modest opinion,â€ the prisoner would naturally look
939987 [31471] straight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done, as that
939987 [31472] was where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting. So that it
939987 [31473] was just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectly
939987 [31474] normal state of mind at the present. The young doctor concluded his
939987 [31475] â€œmodestâ€ testimony with some heat.
939987 [31476] 
939987 [31477] â€œBravo, doctor!â€ cried Mitya, from his seat, â€œjust so!â€
939987 [31478] 
939987 [31479] Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctorâ€™s opinion had a
939987 [31480] decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appeared
939987 [31481] afterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor Herzenstube, when called
939987 [31482] as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya. As an old resident
939987 [31483] in the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he furnished
939987 [31484] some facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though
939987 [31485] recalling something, he added:
939987 [31486] 
939987 [31487] â€œBut the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he had a
939987 [31488] good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know. But the
939987 [31489] Russian proverb says, â€˜If a man has one head, itâ€™s good, but if another
939987 [31490] clever man comes to visit him, it would be better still, for then there
939987 [31491] will be two heads and not only one.â€™ â€
939987 [31492] 
939987 [31493] â€œOne head is good, but two are better,â€ the prosecutor put in impatiently.
939987 [31494] He knew the old manâ€™s habit of talking slowly and deliberately, regardless
939987 [31495] of the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing, and
939987 [31496] highly prizing his flat, dull and always gleefully complacent German wit.
939987 [31497] The old man was fond of making jokes.
939987 [31498] 
939987 [31499] â€œOh, yes, thatâ€™s what I say,â€ he went on stubbornly. â€œOne head is good,
939987 [31500] but two are much better, but he did not meet another head with wits, and
939987 [31501] his wits went. Where did they go? Iâ€™ve forgotten the word.â€ He went on,
939987 [31502] passing his hand before his eyes, â€œOh, yes, _spazieren_.â€
939987 [31503] 
939987 [31504] â€œWandering?â€
939987 [31505] 
939987 [31506] â€œOh, yes, wandering, thatâ€™s what I say. Well, his wits went wandering and
939987 [31507] fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he was a grateful
939987 [31508] and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well, a little chap so high,
939987 [31509] left neglected by his father in the back yard, when he ran about without
939987 [31510] boots on his feet, and his little breeches hanging by one button.â€
939987 [31511] 
939987 [31512] A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old manâ€™s
939987 [31513] voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting something, and
939987 [31514] caught at it instantly.
939987 [31515] 
939987 [31516] â€œOh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty-five
939987 [31517] then, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry for the boy then; I
939987 [31518] asked myself why shouldnâ€™t I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what? Iâ€™ve
939987 [31519] forgotten what itâ€™s called. A pound of what children are very fond of,
939987 [31520] what is it, what is it?â€ The doctor began waving his hands again. â€œIt
939987 [31521] grows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one....â€
939987 [31522] 
939987 [31523] â€œApples?â€
939987 [31524] 
939987 [31525] â€œOh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are a
939987 [31526] lot of them, and all little. You put them in the mouth and crack.â€
939987 [31527] 
939987 [31528] â€œNuts?â€
939987 [31529] 
939987 [31530] â€œQuite so, nuts, I say so.â€ The doctor repeated in the calmest way as
939987 [31531] though he had been at no loss for a word. â€œAnd I bought him a pound of
939987 [31532] nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before. And I
939987 [31533] lifted my finger and said to him, â€˜Boy, _Gott der Vater_.â€™ He laughed and
939987 [31534] said, â€˜_Gott der Vater_.â€™... â€˜_Gott der Sohn_.â€™ He laughed again and
939987 [31535] lisped, â€˜_Gott der Sohn_.â€™ â€˜_Gott der heilige Geist_.â€™ Then he laughed and
939987 [31536] said as best he could, â€˜_Gott der heilige Geist_.â€™ I went away, and two
939987 [31537] days after I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me of himself,
939987 [31538] â€˜Uncle, _Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_,â€™ and he had only forgotten â€˜_Gott
939987 [31539] der heilige Geist_.â€™ But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for
939987 [31540] him again. But he was taken away, and I did not see him again.
939987 [31541] Twenty-three years passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, a
939987 [31542] white-haired old man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man,
939987 [31543] whom I should never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,
939987 [31544] laughing, â€˜_Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_, and _Gott der heilige Geist_.
939987 [31545] I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for
939987 [31546] no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one that ever
939987 [31547] did.â€™ And then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard,
939987 [31548] without boots on his feet, and my heart was touched and I said, â€˜You are a
939987 [31549] grateful young man, for you have remembered all your life the pound of
939987 [31550] nuts I bought you in your childhood.â€™ And I embraced him and blessed him.
939987 [31551] And I shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian
939987 [31552] often laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. And
939987 [31553] now, alas!...â€
939987 [31554] 
939987 [31555] â€œAnd I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,â€
939987 [31556] Mitya cried suddenly.
939987 [31557] 
939987 [31558] In any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the
939987 [31559] public. But the chief sensation in Mityaâ€™s favor was created by the
939987 [31560] evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,
939987 [31561] when the witnesses _Ã  dÃ©charge_, that is, called by the defense, began
939987 [31562] giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to
939987 [31563] Mitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to the
939987 [31564] counsel for the defense. But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyosha
939987 [31565] was examined, and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive
939987 [31566] evidence against one important point made by the prosecution.
939987 [31567] 
939987 [31568] 
939987 [31569] 
939987 [31570] Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya
939987 [31571] 
939987 [31572] 
939987 [31573] It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not required
939987 [31574] to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him very gently
939987 [31575] and sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for goodness had
939987 [31576] preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint, but
939987 [31577] his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to
939987 [31578] one question, he sketched his brotherâ€™s character as that of a man,
939987 [31579] violent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same
939987 [31580] time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if
939987 [31581] necessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka
939987 [31582] and his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an
939987 [31583] intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the suggestion that
939987 [31584] his brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though he
939987 [31585] recognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession
939987 [31586] with Mitya; that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he had
939987 [31587] been cheated of by his father, and that, indifferent as he was to money as
939987 [31588] a rule, he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury. As
939987 [31589] for the rivalry of the two â€œladies,â€ as the prosecutor expressed itâ€”that
939987 [31590] is, of Grushenka and Katyaâ€”he answered evasively and was even unwilling to
939987 [31591] answer one or two questions altogether.
939987 [31592] 
939987 [31593] â€œDid your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your father?â€
939987 [31594] asked the prosecutor. â€œYou can refuse to answer if you think necessary,â€
939987 [31595] he added.
939987 [31596] 
939987 [31597] â€œHe did not tell me so directly,â€ answered Alyosha.
939987 [31598] 
939987 [31599] â€œHow so? Did he indirectly?â€
939987 [31600] 
939987 [31601] â€œHe spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at an
939987 [31602] extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.â€
939987 [31603] 
939987 [31604] â€œAnd you believed him?â€
939987 [31605] 
939987 [31606] â€œI am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higher
939987 [31607] feeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed saved
939987 [31608] him, for it was not he killed my father,â€ Alyosha said firmly, in a loud
939987 [31609] voice that was heard throughout the court.
939987 [31610] 
939987 [31611] The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.
939987 [31612] 
939987 [31613] â€œLet me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your
939987 [31614] conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for
939987 [31615] your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is
939987 [31616] known to us already from the preliminary investigation. I wonâ€™t attempt to
939987 [31617] conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the
939987 [31618] other evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential
939987 [31619] to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your
939987 [31620] brotherâ€™s innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you
939987 [31621] gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?â€
939987 [31622] 
939987 [31623] â€œI only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,â€
939987 [31624] replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. â€œI made no accusation against
939987 [31625] Smerdyakov of myself.â€
939987 [31626] 
939987 [31627] â€œYet you gave evidence against him?â€
939987 [31628] 
939987 [31629] â€œI was led to do so by my brother Dmitriâ€™s words. I was told what took
939987 [31630] place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was
939987 [31631] examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he
939987 [31632] didnâ€™t commit the murder, thenâ€”â€
939987 [31633] 
939987 [31634] â€œThen Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded
939987 [31635] of your brotherâ€™s innocence?â€
939987 [31636] 
939987 [31637] â€œI cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldnâ€™t lie to me. I saw
939987 [31638] from his face he wasnâ€™t lying.â€
939987 [31639] 
939987 [31640] â€œOnly from his face? Is that all the proof you have?â€
939987 [31641] 
939987 [31642] â€œI have no other proof.â€
939987 [31643] 
939987 [31644] â€œAnd of Smerdyakovâ€™s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brotherâ€™s
939987 [31645] word and the expression of his face?â€
939987 [31646] 
939987 [31647] â€œNo, I have no other proof.â€
939987 [31648] 
939987 [31649] The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left
939987 [31650] by Alyoshaâ€™s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been
939987 [31651] talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some
939987 [31652] one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered
939987 [31653] together some extraordinary proofs of his brotherâ€™s innocence and
939987 [31654] Smerdyakovâ€™s guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except
939987 [31655] certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.
939987 [31656] 
939987 [31657] But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking Alyosha when
939987 [31658] it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father and
939987 [31659] that he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance, at
939987 [31660] their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he answered,
939987 [31661] as though only just recollecting and understanding something.
939987 [31662] 
939987 [31663] â€œI remember one circumstance now which Iâ€™d quite forgotten myself. It
939987 [31664] wasnâ€™t clear to me at the time, but nowâ€”â€
939987 [31665] 
939987 [31666] And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he recounted
939987 [31667] eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree,
939987 [31668] on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, â€œthe
939987 [31669] upper part of the breast,â€ and had repeated several times that he had a
939987 [31670] means of regaining his honor, that that means was here, here on his
939987 [31671] breast. â€œI thought, when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it
939987 [31672] was in his heart,â€ Alyosha continued, â€œthat he might find in his heart
939987 [31673] strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him
939987 [31674] and which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did think
939987 [31675] at the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace he
939987 [31676] was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some
939987 [31677] violence to him. Yet it was just then that he pointed to something on his
939987 [31678] breast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart
939987 [31679] is not on that part of the breast, but below, and that he struck himself
939987 [31680] much too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My
939987 [31681] idea seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to
939987 [31682] that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!â€
939987 [31683] 
939987 [31684] â€œJust so,â€ Mitya cried from his place. â€œThatâ€™s right, Alyosha, it was the
939987 [31685] little bag I struck with my fist.â€
939987 [31686] 
939987 [31687] Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and at
939987 [31688] the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by his
939987 [31689] recollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably
939987 [31690] just that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have returned to
939987 [31691] Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he had yet
939987 [31692] determined not to repay her and to use for another purposeâ€”namely, to
939987 [31693] enable him to elope with Grushenka, if she consented.
939987 [31694] 
939987 [31695] â€œIt is so, it must be so,â€ exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. â€œMy
939987 [31696] brother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he said
939987 [31697] _half_ several times) he could free himself from at once, but that he was
939987 [31698] so unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldnâ€™t do it ... that he knew
939987 [31699] beforehand he was incapable of doing it!â€
939987 [31700] 
939987 [31701] â€œAnd you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on this
939987 [31702] part of the breast?â€ Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.
939987 [31703] 
939987 [31704] â€œClearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, â€˜Why does he strike
939987 [31705] himself up there when the heart is lower down?â€™ and the thought seemed
939987 [31706] stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed
939987 [31707] through my mind. Thatâ€™s what brought it back to me just now. How could I
939987 [31708] have forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant when he said
939987 [31709] he had the means but wouldnâ€™t give back that fifteen hundred. And when he
939987 [31710] was arrested at Mokroe he cried outâ€”I know, I was told itâ€”that he
939987 [31711] considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had the
939987 [31712] means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her,
939987 [31713] he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain
939987 [31714] a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what
939987 [31715] torture that debt has been to him!â€ Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion.
939987 [31716] 
939987 [31717] The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe once
939987 [31718] more how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the question,
939987 [31719] â€œHad the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had simply
939987 [31720] struck himself with his fist on the breast?â€
939987 [31721] 
939987 [31722] â€œBut it was not with his fist,â€ cried Alyosha; â€œhe pointed with his
939987 [31723] fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so completely
939987 [31724] forgotten it till this moment?â€
939987 [31725] 
939987 [31726] The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witnessâ€™s
939987 [31727] evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to the
939987 [31728] fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck, and
939987 [31729] that that was, of course, the disgrace, â€œA disgrace I cannot deny, the
939987 [31730] most shameful act of my whole life,â€ cried Mitya. â€œI might have repaid it
939987 [31731] and didnâ€™t repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than
939987 [31732] give it back. And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand
939987 [31733] I shouldnâ€™t give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!â€
939987 [31734] 
939987 [31735] So Alyoshaâ€™s cross-examination ended. What was important and striking
939987 [31736] about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though this
939987 [31737] were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did go
939987 [31738] some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained
939987 [31739] fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the
939987 [31740] preliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred
939987 [31741] roubles were â€œhis own.â€ Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved
939987 [31742] away to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: â€œHow was
939987 [31743] it I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back to
939987 [31744] me now?â€
939987 [31745] 
939987 [31746] Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered something
939987 [31747] extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettes
939987 [31748] and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get a
939987 [31749] better view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned â€œwhite as
939987 [31750] a sheetâ€ on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly, almost
939987 [31751] timidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated;
939987 [31752] but there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark
939987 [31753] that many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that
939987 [31754] moment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the
939987 [31755] court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear
939987 [31756] composed. The President began his examination discreetly and very
939987 [31757] respectfully, as though afraid to touch on â€œcertain chords,â€ and showing
939987 [31758] consideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first
939987 [31759] questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly
939987 [31760] betrothed to the prisoner, â€œuntil he left me of his own accord...â€ she
939987 [31761] added quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had
939987 [31762] entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, â€œI didnâ€™t
939987 [31763] give him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was
939987 [31764] in great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the
939987 [31765] understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to.
939987 [31766] There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.â€
939987 [31767] 
939987 [31768] I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in
939987 [31769] detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.
939987 [31770] 
939987 [31771] â€œI was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got
939987 [31772] money from his father,â€ she went on. â€œI have never doubted his
939987 [31773] disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money
939987 [31774] matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his
939987 [31775] father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with
939987 [31776] his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by
939987 [31777] his father. I donâ€™t remember any threat uttered by him against his father.
939987 [31778] He certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to me
939987 [31779] at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that
939987 [31780] unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see me ...
939987 [31781] and I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite
939987 [31782] him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,â€ she
939987 [31783] added suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her voice. â€œI was
939987 [31784] once indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand,
939987 [31785] and I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I should
939987 [31786] ever be in a position to repay my debt.â€
939987 [31787] 
939987 [31788] There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch began
939987 [31789] his cross-examination.
939987 [31790] 
939987 [31791] â€œDid that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?â€
939987 [31792] Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way, instantly scenting
939987 [31793] something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis that, though
939987 [31794] Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance of
939987 [31795] Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing about the episode of the four
939987 [31796] thousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her â€œbowing to the ground to
939987 [31797] him.â€ She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that was
939987 [31798] strange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know
939987 [31799] till the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the
939987 [31800] court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.
939987 [31801] 
939987 [31802] No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. She
939987 [31803] told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her
939987 [31804] bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and her
939987 [31805] going to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that
939987 [31806] Mitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should â€œsend him
939987 [31807] Katerina Ivanovnaâ€ to fetch the money. She generously concealed that and
939987 [31808] was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run
939987 [31809] to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money.
939987 [31810] It was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. The
939987 [31811] court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something unexampled.
939987 [31812] Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was,
939987 [31813] such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation,
939987 [31814] seemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To save the man who had
939987 [31815] deceived and insulted her and to help, in however small a degree, in
939987 [31816] saving him, by creating a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the
939987 [31817] figure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent
939987 [31818] girl, handed her his last four thousand roublesâ€”all he had in the
939987 [31819] worldâ€”was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ... I
939987 [31820] had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it
939987 [31821] later (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the town
939987 [31822] afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite
939987 [31823] completeâ€”that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young lady
939987 [31824] depart â€œwith nothing but a respectful bow.â€ It was hinted that something
939987 [31825] was here omitted.
939987 [31826] 
939987 [31827] â€œAnd even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,â€ the
939987 [31828] most highly respected of our ladies maintained, â€œeven then itâ€™s very
939987 [31829] doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way,
939987 [31830] even for the sake of saving her father.â€
939987 [31831] 
939987 [31832] And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid
939987 [31833] sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like that?
939987 [31834] She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell everything.
939987 [31835] Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story
939987 [31836] only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by
939987 [31837] it. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost
939987 [31838] shame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture
939987 [31839] upon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her.
939987 [31840] Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to
939987 [31841] give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same
939987 [31842] man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three thousandâ€”the
939987 [31843] idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of
939987 [31844] theft, at least, was as good as disproved. â€œThe caseâ€ was thrown into
939987 [31845] quite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for
939987 [31846] him.... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving
939987 [31847] her evidence, he jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his
939987 [31848] face in his hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a
939987 [31849] sobbing voice:
939987 [31850] 
939987 [31851] â€œKatya, why have you ruined me?â€ and his sobs were audible all over the
939987 [31852] court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:
939987 [31853] 
939987 [31854] â€œNow I am condemned!â€
939987 [31855] 
939987 [31856] Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms
939987 [31857] across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in
939987 [31858] her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who were
939987 [31859] sitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over as
939987 [31860] though in a fever. Grushenka was called.
939987 [31861] 
939987 [31862] I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause
939987 [31863] of Mityaâ€™s ruin. For I am convinced, so is every oneâ€”all the lawyers said
939987 [31864] the same afterwardsâ€”that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoner
939987 [31865] would at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that later. A few
939987 [31866] words first about Grushenka.
939987 [31867] 
939987 [31868] She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black shawl
939987 [31869] on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her smooth, noiseless
939987 [31870] tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure. She
939987 [31871] looked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither to the right
939987 [31872] nor to the left. To my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment,
939987 [31873] and not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too,
939987 [31874] that she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she
939987 [31875] was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and
939987 [31876] inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not
939987 [31877] stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry and eager
939987 [31878] to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element of
939987 [31879] timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it was
939987 [31880] not strange that her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry,
939987 [31881] contemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note of
939987 [31882] self-condemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a
939987 [31883] desperate plunge; as though she felt, â€œI donâ€™t care what happens, Iâ€™ll say
939987 [31884] it....â€ Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked
939987 [31885] curtly, â€œThatâ€™s all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester
939987 [31886] me?â€ But a minute later she added, â€œIt was all my fault. I was laughing at
939987 [31887] them bothâ€”at the old man and at him, tooâ€”and I brought both of them to
939987 [31888] this. It was all on account of me it happened.â€
939987 [31889] 
939987 [31890] Samsonovâ€™s name came up somehow. â€œThatâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business,â€ she snapped
939987 [31891] at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. â€œHe was my benefactor; he took
939987 [31892] me when I hadnâ€™t a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.â€ The
939987 [31893] President reminded her, though very politely, that she must answer the
939987 [31894] questions directly, without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka
939987 [31895] crimsoned and her eyes flashed.
939987 [31896] 
939987 [31897] The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heard
939987 [31898] from â€œthat wicked wretchâ€ that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with
939987 [31899] notes for three thousand in it. â€œBut that was all foolishness. I was only
939987 [31900] laughing. I wouldnâ€™t have gone to him for anything.â€
939987 [31901] 
939987 [31902] â€œTo whom are you referring as â€˜that wicked wretchâ€™?â€ inquired the
939987 [31903] prosecutor.
939987 [31904] 
939987 [31905] â€œThe lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself last
939987 [31906] night.â€
939987 [31907] 
939987 [31908] She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a definite
939987 [31909] accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for it.
939987 [31910] 
939987 [31911] â€œDmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. The woman
939987 [31912] who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let me
939987 [31913] tell you,â€ Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and
939987 [31914] there was a vindictive note in her voice.
939987 [31915] 
939987 [31916] She was again asked to whom she was referring.
939987 [31917] 
939987 [31918] â€œThe young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered me
939987 [31919] chocolate, tried to fascinate me. Thereâ€™s not much true shame about her, I
939987 [31920] can tell you that....â€
939987 [31921] 
939987 [31922] At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to moderate
939987 [31923] her language. But the jealous womanâ€™s heart was burning, and she did not
939987 [31924] care what she did.
939987 [31925] 
939987 [31926] â€œWhen the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,â€ the prosecutor asked, â€œevery
939987 [31927] one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: â€˜Itâ€™s all my
939987 [31928] fault. Weâ€™ll go to Siberia together!â€™ So you already believed him to have
939987 [31929] murdered his father?â€
939987 [31930] 
939987 [31931] â€œI donâ€™t remember what I felt at the time,â€ answered Grushenka. â€œEvery one
939987 [31932] was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it was my
939987 [31933] fault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when he said he
939987 [31934] wasnâ€™t guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and always
939987 [31935] shall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.â€
939987 [31936] 
939987 [31937] Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among other
939987 [31938] things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles â€œyou paid him
939987 [31939] for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.â€
939987 [31940] 
939987 [31941] â€œThere was nothing strange about his taking the money,â€ sneered Grushenka,
939987 [31942] with angry contempt. â€œHe was always coming to me for money: he used to get
939987 [31943] thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had
939987 [31944] enough to keep him without my help.â€
939987 [31945] 
939987 [31946] â€œWhat led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?â€ Fetyukovitch asked, in
939987 [31947] spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.
939987 [31948] 
939987 [31949] â€œWhy, he is my cousin. His mother was my motherâ€™s sister. But heâ€™s always
939987 [31950] besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of
939987 [31951] me.â€
939987 [31952] 
939987 [31953] This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in
939987 [31954] the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned
939987 [31955] purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she
939987 [31956] came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she
939987 [31957] was angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitinâ€™s speech, of his
939987 [31958] noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder
939987 [31959] of Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it
939987 [31960] was another godsend. Grushenkaâ€™s cross-examination did not last long and,
939987 [31961] of course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. She
939987 [31962] left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of
939987 [31963] contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidence
939987 [31964] and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina
939987 [31965] Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat as though
939987 [31966] turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
939987 [31967] 
939987 [31968] Ivan was called to give evidence.
939987 [31969] 
939987 [31970] 
939987 [31971] 
939987 [31972] Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe
939987 [31973] 
939987 [31974] 
939987 [31975] I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of the
939987 [31976] court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or
939987 [31977] some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was
939987 [31978] ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed to
939987 [31979] have heard it and it only came out later.
939987 [31980] 
939987 [31981] His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal
939987 [31982] witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned.
939987 [31983] Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almost
939987 [31984] fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably had
939987 [31985] little information to give after all that had been given. Time was
939987 [31986] passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one,
939987 [31987] and with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was
939987 [31988] irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression, on me at
939987 [31989] least: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying manâ€™s. His eyes
939987 [31990] were lusterless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha
939987 [31991] jumped up from his seat and moaned â€œAh!â€ I remember that, but it was
939987 [31992] hardly noticed.
939987 [31993] 
939987 [31994] The President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath,
939987 [31995] that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he must
939987 [31996] bear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivan
939987 [31997] listened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into a
939987 [31998] smile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment,
939987 [31999] finished, he laughed outright.
939987 [32000] 
939987 [32001] â€œWell, and what else?â€ he asked in a loud voice.
939987 [32002] 
939987 [32003] There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange.
939987 [32004] The President showed signs of uneasiness.
939987 [32005] 
939987 [32006] â€œYou ... are perhaps still unwell?â€ he began, looking everywhere for the
939987 [32007] usher.
939987 [32008] 
939987 [32009] â€œDonâ€™t trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell
939987 [32010] you something interesting,â€ Ivan answered with sudden calmness and
939987 [32011] respectfulness.
939987 [32012] 
939987 [32013] â€œYou have some special communication to make?â€ the President went on,
939987 [32014] still mistrustfully.
939987 [32015] 
939987 [32016] Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered,
939987 [32017] almost stammering:
939987 [32018] 
939987 [32019] â€œNo ... I havenâ€™t. I have nothing particular.â€
939987 [32020] 
939987 [32021] They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,
939987 [32022] with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more
939987 [32023] marked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered that
939987 [32024] he did not know. He knew nothing of his fatherâ€™s money relations with
939987 [32025] Dmitri. â€œI wasnâ€™t interested in the subject,â€ he added. Threats to murder
939987 [32026] his father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he
939987 [32027] had heard from Smerdyakov.
939987 [32028] 
939987 [32029] â€œThe same thing over and over again,â€ he interrupted suddenly, with a look
939987 [32030] of weariness. â€œI have nothing particular to tell the court.â€
939987 [32031] 
939987 [32032] â€œI see you are unwell and understand your feelings,â€ the President began.
939987 [32033] 
939987 [32034] He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them
939987 [32035] to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in an
939987 [32036] exhausted voice:
939987 [32037] 
939987 [32038] â€œLet me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.â€
939987 [32039] 
939987 [32040] And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walk
939987 [32041] out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though he
939987 [32042] had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.
939987 [32043] 
939987 [32044] â€œI am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it go?
939987 [32045] â€˜Iâ€™ll stand up if I like, and I wonâ€™t if I donâ€™t.â€™ They were trying to put
939987 [32046] on her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she said, â€˜Iâ€™ll
939987 [32047] stand up if I like, and I wonâ€™t if I donâ€™t.â€™... Itâ€™s in some book about
939987 [32048] the peasantry.â€
939987 [32049] 
939987 [32050] â€œWhat do you mean by that?â€ the President asked severely.
939987 [32051] 
939987 [32052] â€œWhy, this,â€ Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. â€œHereâ€™s the money
939987 [32053] ... the notes that lay in that envelopeâ€ (he nodded towards the table on
939987 [32054] which lay the material evidence), â€œfor the sake of which our father was
939987 [32055] murdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.â€
939987 [32056] 
939987 [32057] The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President.
939987 [32058] 
939987 [32059] â€œHow could this money have come into your possession if it is the same
939987 [32060] money?â€ the President asked wonderingly.
939987 [32061] 
939987 [32062] â€œI got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was with
939987 [32063] him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother, killed our
939987 [32064] father. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who doesnâ€™t desire
939987 [32065] his fatherâ€™s death?â€
939987 [32066] 
939987 [32067] â€œAre you in your right mind?â€ broke involuntarily from the President.
939987 [32068] 
939987 [32069] â€œI should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all of
939987 [32070] you ... as all these ... ugly faces.â€ He turned suddenly to the audience.
939987 [32071] â€œMy father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,â€ he
939987 [32072] snarled, with furious contempt. â€œThey keep up the sham with one another.
939987 [32073] Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devours
939987 [32074] another.... If there hadnâ€™t been a murder, theyâ€™d have been angry and gone
939987 [32075] home ill-humored. Itâ€™s a spectacle they want! _Panem et circenses_. Though
939987 [32076] I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christâ€™s sake!â€
939987 [32077] He suddenly clutched his head.
939987 [32078] 
939987 [32079] The usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, â€œHe is ill.
939987 [32080] Donâ€™t believe him: he has brain fever.â€ Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively
939987 [32081] from her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and
939987 [32082] greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strange
939987 [32083] smile.
939987 [32084] 
939987 [32085] â€œDonâ€™t disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,â€ Ivan began
939987 [32086] again. â€œYou canâ€™t expect eloquence from a murderer,â€ he added suddenly for
939987 [32087] some reason and laughed a queer laugh.
939987 [32088] 
939987 [32089] The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two other
939987 [32090] judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears
939987 [32091] as he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The President seemed
939987 [32092] suddenly to recollect himself.
939987 [32093] 
939987 [32094] â€œWitness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm
939987 [32095] yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have something
939987 [32096] to tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not
939987 [32097] delirious?â€
939987 [32098] 
939987 [32099] â€œThatâ€™s just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov wonâ€™t send you
939987 [32100] proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing but
939987 [32101] envelopesâ€”one is enough. Iâ€™ve no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,â€ he
939987 [32102] smiled thoughtfully.
939987 [32103] 
939987 [32104] â€œWho is your witness?â€
939987 [32105] 
939987 [32106] â€œHe has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! _Le diable
939987 [32107] nâ€™existe point!_ Donâ€™t pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful devil,â€ he
939987 [32108] added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.
939987 [32109] â€œHe is here somewhere, no doubtâ€”under that table with the material
939987 [32110] evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listen
939987 [32111] to me. I told him I donâ€™t want to keep quiet, and he talked about the
939987 [32112] geological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the monster ... heâ€™s been
939987 [32113] singing a hymn. Thatâ€™s because his heart is light! Itâ€™s like a drunken man
939987 [32114] in the street bawling how â€˜Vanka went to Petersburg,â€™ and I would give a
939987 [32115] quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You donâ€™t know me! Oh,
939987 [32116] how stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him! I didnâ€™t
939987 [32117] come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?...â€
939987 [32118] 
939987 [32119] And he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him again.
939987 [32120] But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, but
939987 [32121] the court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.
939987 [32122] 
939987 [32123] â€œWhat are you about?â€ he cried, staring into the manâ€™s face, and suddenly
939987 [32124] seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But the
939987 [32125] police were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And all
939987 [32126] the time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed something
939987 [32127] incoherent.
939987 [32128] 
939987 [32129] The whole court was thrown into confusion. I donâ€™t remember everything as
939987 [32130] it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. I only know that
939987 [32131] afterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood what
939987 [32132] had happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he very
939987 [32133] reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctor
939987 [32134] had seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but
939987 [32135] that, until he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively,
939987 [32136] so that nothing could have been foreseenâ€”that he had, in fact, insisted on
939987 [32137] giving evidence. But before every one had completely regained their
939987 [32138] composure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.
939987 [32139] Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking
939987 [32140] loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them not
939987 [32141] to remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:
939987 [32142] 
939987 [32143] â€œThere is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a
939987 [32144] document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! Itâ€™s a letter
939987 [32145] from that monster ... that man there, there!â€ she pointed to Mitya. â€œIt
939987 [32146] was he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me how
939987 [32147] he would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he is
939987 [32148] delirious!â€ she kept crying out, beside herself.
939987 [32149] 
939987 [32150] The court usher took the document she held out to the President, and she,
939987 [32151] dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began convulsively
939987 [32152] and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for
939987 [32153] fear she should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed up
939987 [32154] was that letter Mitya had written at the â€œMetropolisâ€ tavern, which Ivan
939987 [32155] had spoken of as a â€œmathematical proof.â€ Alas! its mathematical
939987 [32156] conclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mitya
939987 [32157] might have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less
939987 [32158] terrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What
939987 [32159] followed is still confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have
939987 [32160] at once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on
939987 [32161] both sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness. On being
939987 [32162] gently asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently,
939987 [32163] Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:
939987 [32164] 
939987 [32165] â€œI am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,â€ she added,
939987 [32166] evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving
939987 [32167] evidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and
939987 [32168] under what circumstances she received it.
939987 [32169] 
939987 [32170] â€œI received it the day before the crime was committed, but he wrote it the
939987 [32171] day before that, at the tavernâ€”that is, two days before he committed the
939987 [32172] crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!â€ she cried breathlessly.
939987 [32173] â€œHe hated me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and was
939987 [32174] running after that creature ... and because he owed me that three
939987 [32175] thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of
939987 [32176] his own meanness! This is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg
939987 [32177] you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father,
939987 [32178] he came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and what he
939987 [32179] wanted it for. Yes, yesâ€”to win that creature and carry her off. I knew
939987 [32180] then that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I,
939987 [32181] I, who gave him that money, who offered it to him on the pretext of his
939987 [32182] sending it to my sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in
939987 [32183] the face and said that he could send it when he liked, â€˜in a monthâ€™s time
939987 [32184] would do.â€™ How, how could he have failed to understand that I was
939987 [32185] practically telling him to his face, â€˜You want money to be false to me
939987 [32186] with your creature, so hereâ€™s the money for you. I give it to you myself.
939987 [32187] Take it, if you have so little honor as to take it!â€™ I wanted to prove
939987 [32188] what he was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it
939987 [32189] with that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all
939987 [32190] about it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money to
939987 [32191] test him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take
939987 [32192] it from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and he
939987 [32193] understood it all and he took itâ€”he carried off my money!â€
939987 [32194] 
939987 [32195] â€œThatâ€™s true, Katya,â€ Mitya roared suddenly, â€œI looked into your eyes and
939987 [32196] I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money. Despise me
939987 [32197] as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! Iâ€™ve deserved it!â€
939987 [32198] 
939987 [32199] â€œPrisoner,â€ cried the President, â€œanother word and I will order you to be
939987 [32200] removed.â€
939987 [32201] 
939987 [32202] â€œThat money was a torment to him,â€ Katya went on with impulsive haste. â€œHe
939987 [32203] wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, thatâ€™s true; but he needed money for
939987 [32204] that creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didnâ€™t repay me, and
939987 [32205] went off with her to that village where he was arrested. There, again, he
939987 [32206] squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a
939987 [32207] day before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he wrote
939987 [32208] it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite, and feeling
939987 [32209] certain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, even
939987 [32210] if he did kill him, or else he wouldnâ€™t have written it. For he knew I
939987 [32211] shouldnâ€™t want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read it
939987 [32212] attentivelyâ€”more attentively, pleaseâ€”and you will see that he had
939987 [32213] described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill his
939987 [32214] father and where his money was kept. Look, please, donâ€™t overlook that,
939987 [32215] thereâ€™s one phrase there, â€˜I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone
939987 [32216] away.â€™ So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,â€
939987 [32217] Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant
939987 [32218] triumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and
939987 [32219] detected every meaning underlining it. â€œIf he hadnâ€™t been drunk, he
939987 [32220] wouldnâ€™t have written to me; but, look, everything is written there
939987 [32221] beforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program of
939987 [32222] it!â€ she exclaimed frantically.
939987 [32223] 
939987 [32224] She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she
939987 [32225] had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with
939987 [32226] anger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she
939987 [32227] had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by
939987 [32228] the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming
939987 [32229] impression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the
939987 [32230] letter.
939987 [32231] 
939987 [32232] â€œItâ€™s mine, mine!â€ cried Mitya. â€œI shouldnâ€™t have written it, if I hadnâ€™t
939987 [32233] been drunk!... Weâ€™ve hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear,
939987 [32234] I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didnâ€™t love me!â€
939987 [32235] 
939987 [32236] He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutor
939987 [32237] and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her, chiefly to
939987 [32238] ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give her
939987 [32239] evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.
939987 [32240] 
939987 [32241] â€œYes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor and
939987 [32242] my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised me
939987 [32243] so!â€ Katya cried madly. â€œOh, he has despised me horribly, he has always
939987 [32244] despised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very moment that
939987 [32245] I bowed down to him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at
939987 [32246] the time, but for a long time I wouldnâ€™t believe it. How often I have read
939987 [32247] it in his eyes, â€˜You came of yourself, though.â€™ Oh, he didnâ€™t understand,
939987 [32248] he had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but baseness, he
939987 [32249] judged me by himself, he thought every one was like himself!â€ Katya hissed
939987 [32250] furiously, in a perfect frenzy. â€œAnd he only wanted to marry me, because
939987 [32251] Iâ€™d inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always
939987 [32252] suspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was always
939987 [32253] convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him,
939987 [32254] because I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever
939987 [32255] for it, and so to be superior to meâ€”thatâ€™s why he wanted to marry me!
939987 [32256] Thatâ€™s so, thatâ€™s all so! I tried to conquer him by my loveâ€”a love that
939987 [32257] knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he
939987 [32258] understood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed? He is a
939987 [32259] monster! I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought me
939987 [32260] from the tavernâ€”and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to
939987 [32261] forgive him everything, everythingâ€”even his treachery!â€
939987 [32262] 
939987 [32263] The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I canâ€™t
939987 [32264] help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria
939987 [32265] and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, â€œWe
939987 [32266] understand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,â€
939987 [32267] and so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving,
939987 [32268] hysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary clearness,
939987 [32269] which is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought
939987 [32270] states, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last
939987 [32271] two months trying to save â€œthe monster and murderer,â€ his brother.
939987 [32272] 
939987 [32273] â€œHe tortured himself,â€ she exclaimed, â€œhe was always trying to minimize
939987 [32274] his brotherâ€™s guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved his
939987 [32275] father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender,
939987 [32276] over-tender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He told
939987 [32277] me everything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as his only
939987 [32278] friend. I have the honor to be his only friend!â€ she cried suddenly with a
939987 [32279] sort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. â€œHe had been twice to see
939987 [32280] Smerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, â€˜If it was not my brother, but
939987 [32281] Smerdyakov committed the murderâ€™ (for the legend was circulating
939987 [32282] everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), â€˜perhaps I too am guilty, for
939987 [32283] Smerdyakov knew I didnâ€™t like my father and perhaps believed that I
939987 [32284] desired my fatherâ€™s death.â€™ Then I brought out that letter and showed it
939987 [32285] him. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done it, and he was
939987 [32286] overwhelmed by it. He couldnâ€™t endure the thought that his own brother was
939987 [32287] a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During the
939987 [32288] last few days he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mind
939987 [32289] was giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the
939987 [32290] streets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day
939987 [32291] before yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain feverâ€”and all
939987 [32292] on his account, on account of this monster! And last night he learnt that
939987 [32293] Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind
939987 [32294] ... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!â€
939987 [32295] 
939987 [32296] Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once in
939987 [32297] a lifetimeâ€”at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold!
939987 [32298] But it was in Katyaâ€™s character, and it was such a moment in her life. It
939987 [32299] was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a
939987 [32300] young profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before,
939987 [32301] in her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty
939987 [32302] before all these people, telling of Mityaâ€™s generous conduct, in the hope
939987 [32303] of softening his fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself;
939987 [32304] but this time it was for another, and perhaps only nowâ€”perhaps only at
939987 [32305] this momentâ€”she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She had
939987 [32306] sacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden that he
939987 [32307] had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the
939987 [32308] murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to save
939987 [32309] his good name, his reputation!
939987 [32310] 
939987 [32311] And yet one terrible doubt occurred to oneâ€”was she lying in her
939987 [32312] description of her former relations with Mitya?â€”that was the question. No,
939987 [32313] she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised
939987 [32314] her for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had been
939987 [32315] firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-hearted
939987 [32316] Mitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and despising her.
939987 [32317] She had loved him with an hysterical, â€œlaceratedâ€ love only from pride,
939987 [32318] from wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more like
939987 [32319] revenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love,
939987 [32320] perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mityaâ€™s faithlessness
939987 [32321] had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could not
939987 [32322] forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and all
939987 [32323] that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended
939987 [32324] womanâ€™s breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya,
939987 [32325] but she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had she given full expression
939987 [32326] to her feelings than the tension of course was over and she was
939987 [32327] overwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor,
939987 [32328] sobbing and screaming. She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with
939987 [32329] a wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.
939987 [32330] 
939987 [32331] â€œMitya,â€ she wailed, â€œyour serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shown
939987 [32332] you what she is!â€ she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a
939987 [32333] signal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from the
939987 [32334] court. She wouldnâ€™t allow it. She fought and struggled to get back to
939987 [32335] Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was
939987 [32336] overpowered.
939987 [32337] 
939987 [32338] Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been
939987 [32339] satisfiedâ€”the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscow
939987 [32340] doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sent
939987 [32341] the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announced
939987 [32342] to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of
939987 [32343] brain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer to questions
939987 [32344] from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that the
939987 [32345] patient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and
939987 [32346] that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had
939987 [32347] not consented to be looked after. â€œHe was certainly not in a normal state
939987 [32348] of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he
939987 [32349] met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited
939987 [32350] him every evening,â€ said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his
939987 [32351] evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina
939987 [32352] Ivanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the
939987 [32353] judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected
939987 [32354] pieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.
939987 [32355] 
939987 [32356] But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only
939987 [32357] repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their
939987 [32358] characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the
939987 [32359] prosecutorâ€™s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was
939987 [32360] excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were
939987 [32361] awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense
939987 [32362] impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s
939987 [32363] evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had
939987 [32364] been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was
939987 [32365] just eight oâ€™clock when the President returned to his seat and our
939987 [32366] prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.
939987 [32367] 
939987 [32368] 
939987 [32369] 
939987 [32370] Chapter VI. The Prosecutorâ€™s Speech. Sketches Of Character
939987 [32371] 
939987 [32372] 
939987 [32373] Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with
939987 [32374] cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. He
939987 [32375] described this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his
939987 [32376] _chef-dâ€™Å“uvre_, the _chef-dâ€™Å“uvre_ of his whole life, as his swan-song. He
939987 [32377] died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he had
939987 [32378] the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last
939987 [32379] song. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that
939987 [32380] speech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least
939987 [32381] some feeling for the public welfare and â€œthe eternal questionâ€ lay
939987 [32382] concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity.
939987 [32383] He genuinely believed in the prisonerâ€™s guilt; he was accusing him not as
939987 [32384] an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a
939987 [32385] genuine passion â€œfor the security of society.â€ Even the ladies in the
939987 [32386] audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted
939987 [32387] that he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking
939987 [32388] voice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his
939987 [32389] speech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.
939987 [32390] 
939987 [32391] â€œGentlemen of the jury,â€ began the prosecutor, â€œthis case has made a stir
939987 [32392] throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there so
939987 [32393] peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes!
939987 [32394] Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us.
939987 [32395] What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this
939987 [32396] or that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our
939987 [32397] lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an
939987 [32398] unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of
939987 [32399] intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in
939987 [32400] spite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their
939987 [32401] foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among
939987 [32402] us? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and
939987 [32403] every citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn
939987 [32404] and still timid press has done good service to the public already, for
939987 [32405] without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence
939987 [32406] and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, not
939987 [32407] merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present
939987 [32408] reign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of things
939987 [32409] beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace.
939987 [32410] But what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of
939987 [32411] violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us that
939987 [32412] it is difficult to contend against it.
939987 [32413] 
939987 [32414] â€œOne day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very
939987 [32415] outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of
939987 [32416] conscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, and
939987 [32417] the servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he could
939987 [32418] find on him; â€˜it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable
939987 [32419] world and for my career in the future.â€™ After murdering them, he puts
939987 [32420] pillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young
939987 [32421] hero â€˜decorated for braveryâ€™ kills the mother of his chief and benefactor,
939987 [32422] like a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that
939987 [32423] â€˜she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take
939987 [32424] no precautions.â€™ Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in these
939987 [32425] days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but will
939987 [32426] feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul. In silence, alone
939987 [32427] with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, â€˜What is honor, and isnâ€™t
939987 [32428] the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?â€™
939987 [32429] 
939987 [32430] â€œPerhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that
939987 [32431] it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say soâ€”and
939987 [32432] heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, donâ€™t believe
939987 [32433] me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only
939987 [32434] a twentieth part of what I say is trueâ€”even so itâ€™s awful! Look how our
939987 [32435] young people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamletâ€™s question
939987 [32436] what there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all
939987 [32437] that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long
939987 [32438] been erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice,
939987 [32439] at our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present
939987 [32440] case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we
939987 [32441] all knew him, â€˜he lived among us!â€™...
939987 [32442] 
939987 [32443] â€œYes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe will
939987 [32444] study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it. But
939987 [32445] this study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydom
939987 [32446] of to-day is farther behind us, so that itâ€™s possible to examine it with
939987 [32447] more insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now we are either
939987 [32448] horrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over the
939987 [32449] spectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our
939987 [32450] cynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children, we brush the
939987 [32451] dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to
939987 [32452] our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must one
939987 [32453] day begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society;
939987 [32454] itâ€™s time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least
939987 [32455] to make a beginning in that direction.
939987 [32456] 
939987 [32457] â€œA great writer(9) of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika
939987 [32458] galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, â€˜Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who
939987 [32459] invented thee!â€™ and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the
939987 [32460] world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping
939987 [32461] troika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, but
939987 [32462] in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in
939987 [32463] an access of childish and naÃ¯ve optimism, or simply in fear of the
939987 [32464] censorship of the day. For if the troika were drawn by his heroes,
939987 [32465] Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal,
939987 [32466] whoever might be driving it. And those were the heroes of an older
939987 [32467] generation, ours are worse specimens still....â€
939987 [32468] 
939987 [32469] At this point Ippolit Kirillovitchâ€™s speech was interrupted by applause.
939987 [32470] The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The applause was,
939987 [32471] itâ€™s true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think it
939987 [32472] necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction
939987 [32473] of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had never
939987 [32474] been applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get a hearing,
939987 [32475] and now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.
939987 [32476] 
939987 [32477] â€œWhat, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an
939987 [32478] unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?â€ he continued. â€œPerhaps I am
939987 [32479] exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the
939987 [32480] educated class of to-day are reflected in this family pictureâ€”only, of
939987 [32481] course, in miniature, â€˜like the sun in a drop of water.â€™ Think of that
939987 [32482] unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy
939987 [32483] end, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor
939987 [32484] dependent position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a small
939987 [32485] fortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though
939987 [32486] undeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew
939987 [32487] bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics
939987 [32488] disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained.
939987 [32489] On the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his vitality was
939987 [32490] excessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he brought his
939987 [32491] children up to be the same. He had no feelings for his duties as a father.
939987 [32492] He ridiculed those duties. He left his little children to the servants,
939987 [32493] and was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The old
939987 [32494] manâ€™s maxim was _AprÃ¨s moi le dÃ©luge_. He was an example of everything
939987 [32495] that is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant
939987 [32496] individualism. â€˜The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all
939987 [32497] right,â€™ and he was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living
939987 [32498] in the same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own
939987 [32499] son and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get his
939987 [32500] mistress from him. No, I donâ€™t intend to leave the prisonerâ€™s defense
939987 [32501] altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the
939987 [32502] truth myself, I can well understand what resentment he had heaped up in
939987 [32503] his sonâ€™s heart against him.
939987 [32504] 
939987 [32505] â€œBut enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Let
939987 [32506] us remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical fathers
939987 [32507] of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of many
939987 [32508] modern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professing
939987 [32509] such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but their
939987 [32510] philosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but
939987 [32511] you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not
939987 [32512] believe me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember
939987 [32513] something of my words.
939987 [32514] 
939987 [32515] â€œNow for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of them
939987 [32516] is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him.
939987 [32517] Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.
939987 [32518] 
939987 [32519] â€œThe elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and
939987 [32520] vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied
939987 [32521] and rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he was
939987 [32522] a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions, quite
939987 [32523] the contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him
939987 [32524] now, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazov
939987 [32525] family. Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his
939987 [32526] own hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and
939987 [32527] possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the
939987 [32528] preliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan
939987 [32529] Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. â€˜Everything in the
939987 [32530] world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in the
939987 [32531] futureâ€”that is what he always taught me.â€™ I believe that idiot was driven
939987 [32532] out of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks
939987 [32533] from which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to
939987 [32534] unhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation,
939987 [32535] which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is,
939987 [32536] indeed, why Iâ€™ve mentioned it: â€˜If there is one of the sons that is like
939987 [32537] Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.â€™
939987 [32538] 
939987 [32539] â€œWith that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it
939987 [32540] indelicate to continue further. Oh, I donâ€™t want to draw any further
939987 [32541] conclusions and croak like a raven over the young manâ€™s future. Weâ€™ve seen
939987 [32542] to-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his young
939987 [32543] heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faith
939987 [32544] and cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance than by the
939987 [32545] exercise of independent thought.
939987 [32546] 
939987 [32547] â€œThen the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does not
939987 [32548] share his elder brotherâ€™s gloomy and destructive theory of life. He has
939987 [32549] sought to cling to the â€˜ideas of the people,â€™ or to what goes by that name
939987 [32550] in some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery,
939987 [32551] and was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed
939987 [32552] unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our
939987 [32553] unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and
939987 [32554] mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return
939987 [32555] to their â€˜native soil,â€™ as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their
939987 [32556] mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the
939987 [32557] withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only
939987 [32558] to escape the horrors that terrify them.
939987 [32559] 
939987 [32560] â€œFor my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I
939987 [32561] trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the
939987 [32562] people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into
939987 [32563] gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinismâ€”two elements
939987 [32564] which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to
939987 [32565] misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his
939987 [32566] elder brother is suffering.â€
939987 [32567] 
939987 [32568] Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and
939987 [32569] mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own
939987 [32570] eloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing
939987 [32571] of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive
939987 [32572] man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life. People
939987 [32573] said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism
939987 [32574] of Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of
939987 [32575] him in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to
939987 [32576] take his revenge. But I donâ€™t know whether it was true. All this was only
939987 [32577] introductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct consideration
939987 [32578] of the case.
939987 [32579] 
939987 [32580] â€œBut to return to the eldest son,â€ Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. â€œHe is
939987 [32581] the prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before us;
939987 [32582] the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface. While his
939987 [32583] brothers seem to stand for â€˜Europeanismâ€™ and â€˜the principles of the
939987 [32584] people,â€™ he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, not
939987 [32585] all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our mother
939987 [32586] Russia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a
939987 [32587] marvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture and
939987 [32588] Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon
939987 [32589] companions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only when all goes
939987 [32590] well with him. What is more, he can be carried off his feet, positively
939987 [32591] carried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves,
939987 [32592] if they fall from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He
939987 [32593] dislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and thatâ€™s so
939987 [32594] with him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life (he
939987 [32595] couldnâ€™t be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he
939987 [32596] will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must
939987 [32597] have money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with
939987 [32598] what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless
939987 [32599] dissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he is
939987 [32600] ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later,
939987 [32601] let us take events in their chronological order.
939987 [32602] 
939987 [32603] â€œFirst, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the
939987 [32604] back-yard â€˜without boots on his feet,â€™ as our worthy and esteemed fellow
939987 [32605] citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat it
939987 [32606] again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse
939987 [32607] him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the
939987 [32608] influence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and
939987 [32609] becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to
939987 [32610] one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an
939987 [32611] officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so
939987 [32612] after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the
939987 [32613] last six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he
939987 [32614] practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with
939987 [32615] his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.
939987 [32616] 
939987 [32617] â€œThen came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant
939987 [32618] education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just
939987 [32619] heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent.
939987 [32620] The figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to
939987 [32621] true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light
939987 [32622] before us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us
939987 [32623] immediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture to
939987 [32624] conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The same lady,
939987 [32625] bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he, he of all
939987 [32626] men, had despised her for her action, which, though incautious, reckless
939987 [32627] perhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the
939987 [32628] girlâ€™s betrothed, looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more
939987 [32629] insufferable from him than from any one. And knowing that he had already
939987 [32630] deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endure
939987 [32631] everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him three
939987 [32632] thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that she
939987 [32633] was offering him money to deceive her. â€˜Well, will you take it or not, are
939987 [32634] you so lost to shame?â€™ was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He
939987 [32635] looked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (heâ€™s admitted here before
939987 [32636] you that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand
939987 [32637] unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of his
939987 [32638] affections.
939987 [32639] 
939987 [32640] â€œWhat are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officer
939987 [32641] sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing
939987 [32642] reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule, between
939987 [32643] two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is not
939987 [32644] true. The probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble,
939987 [32645] and in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broad
939987 [32646] Karamazov characterâ€”thatâ€™s just what I am leading up toâ€”capable of
939987 [32647] combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest
939987 [32648] heights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by
939987 [32649] a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close quartersâ€”Mr.
939987 [32650] Rakitin: â€˜The sense of their own degradation is as essential to those
939987 [32651] reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.â€™ And
939987 [32652] thatâ€™s true, they need continually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at
939987 [32653] the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their
939987 [32654] existence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they
939987 [32655] include everything and put up with everything.
939987 [32656] 
939987 [32657] â€œBy the way, gentlemen of the jury, weâ€™ve just touched upon that three
939987 [32658] thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Can
939987 [32659] you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a
939987 [32660] way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,
939987 [32661] could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that
939987 [32662] very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the
939987 [32663] firmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month
939987 [32664] afterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!
939987 [32665] Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into the
939987 [32666] country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him
939987 [32667] to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father,
939987 [32668] did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to avoid
939987 [32669] abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous, he would
939987 [32670] have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to
939987 [32671] keep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would say to him at
939987 [32672] last â€˜I am yours,â€™ and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.
939987 [32673] 
939987 [32674] â€œBut no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he gives
939987 [32675] for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she would
939987 [32676] say, â€˜I am yours, take me where you will,â€™ he might have the wherewithal
939987 [32677] to take her. But that first reason, in the prisonerâ€™s own words, was of
939987 [32678] little weight beside the second. While I have that money on me, he said, I
939987 [32679] am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed,
939987 [32680] and, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can
939987 [32681] always say to her, â€˜You see, Iâ€™ve squandered half your money, and shown I
939987 [32682] am a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrelâ€™ (I use the
939987 [32683] prisonerâ€™s own expressions), â€˜but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a
939987 [32684] thief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldnâ€™t have brought you back this
939987 [32685] half of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!â€™ A
939987 [32686] marvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not resist
939987 [32687] the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of
939987 [32688] such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness,
939987 [32689] and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does that
939987 [32690] fit in at all with the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture to
939987 [32691] tell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such
939987 [32692] circumstances, if he really had brought himself to put away the money.
939987 [32693] 
939987 [32694] â€œAt the first temptationâ€”for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he
939987 [32695] had already squandered half the moneyâ€”he would have unpicked his little
939987 [32696] bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he have taken
939987 [32697] back precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not
939987 [32698] fourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then that he was not a
939987 [32699] thief, because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time
939987 [32700] he would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then a
939987 [32701] third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he would have
939987 [32702] taken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundred
939987 [32703] it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. And
939987 [32704] then he would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself,
939987 [32705] â€˜Itâ€™s really not worth while to give back one hundred; letâ€™s spend that,
939987 [32706] too!â€™ Thatâ€™s how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would have
939987 [32707] behaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact
939987 [32708] than this legend of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable.
939987 [32709] But we shall return to that later.â€
939987 [32710] 
939987 [32711] After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the
939987 [32712] financial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that it
939987 [32713] was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was in
939987 [32714] the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical
939987 [32715] experts in reference to Mityaâ€™s fixed idea about the three thousand owing
939987 [32716] him.
939987 [32717]

939987 [32719] 
939987 [32720] Chapter VII. An Historical Survey
939987 [32721] 
939987 [32722] 
939987 [32723] â€œThe medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out
939987 [32724] of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that he is in his right
939987 [32725] mind, and that if he had not been, he would have behaved more cleverly. As
939987 [32726] for his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point,
939987 [32727] that is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I think one might
939987 [32728] find a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I
939987 [32729] agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisonerâ€™s
939987 [32730] mental faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been
939987 [32731] irritable and exasperated. The object of the prisonerâ€™s continual and
939987 [32732] violent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the
939987 [32733] bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!â€
939987 [32734] 
939987 [32735] Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisonerâ€™s fatal passion
939987 [32736] for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went to the
939987 [32737] â€œyoung personâ€™sâ€ lodgings â€œto beat herâ€â€”â€œI use his own expression,â€ the
939987 [32738] prosecutor explainedâ€”â€œbut instead of beating her, he remained there, at
939987 [32739] her feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At the same time the
939987 [32740] prisonerâ€™s father was captivated by the same young personâ€”a strange and
939987 [32741] fatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously,
939987 [32742] though both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them the
939987 [32743] most violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own
939987 [32744] confession: â€˜I was laughing at both of them.â€™ Yes, the sudden desire to
939987 [32745] make a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.
939987 [32746] The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roubles
939987 [32747] as a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he would have
939987 [32748] been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet, if only she would
939987 [32749] become his lawful wife. We have good evidence of this. As for the
939987 [32750] prisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it is before us. But such
939987 [32751] was the young personâ€™s â€˜game.â€™ The enchantress gave the unhappy young man
939987 [32752] no hope until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out
939987 [32753] hands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It
939987 [32754] was in that position that he was arrested. â€˜Send me to Siberia with him, I
939987 [32755] have brought him to this, I am most to blame,â€™ the woman herself cried, in
939987 [32756] genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.
939987 [32757] 
939987 [32758] â€œThe talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin,
939987 [32759] characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: â€˜She was
939987 [32760] disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who
939987 [32761] seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by her
939987 [32762] respectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man,
939987 [32763] whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was perhaps
939987 [32764] much that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early.
939987 [32765] She became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentful
939987 [32766] against society.â€™ After this sketch of her character it may well be
939987 [32767] understood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from
939987 [32768] malice.
939987 [32769] 
939987 [32770] â€œAfter a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he
939987 [32771] betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor, the
939987 [32772] prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continual
939987 [32773] jealousyâ€”and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was that the crazy
939987 [32774] old man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means of
939987 [32775] that very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his own
939987 [32776] property, part of his inheritance from his mother, of which his father was
939987 [32777] cheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man
939987 [32778] to madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was used
939987 [32779] with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!â€
939987 [32780] 
939987 [32781] Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his
939987 [32782] father had entered the prisonerâ€™s head, and illustrated his theory with
939987 [32783] facts.
939987 [32784] 
939987 [32785] â€œAt first he only talked about it in tavernsâ€”he was talking about it all
939987 [32786] that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and he
939987 [32787] likes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical and
939987 [32788] dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and expects,
939987 [32789] for some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with perfect
939987 [32790] sympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his part and not
939987 [32791] oppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes up
939987 [32792] everything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about Captain
939987 [32793] Snegiryov.] Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he
939987 [32794] might mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats
939987 [32795] into actions.â€
939987 [32796] 
939987 [32797] Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery,
939987 [32798] the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence when
939987 [32799] the prisoner had rushed into his fatherâ€™s house just after dinner.
939987 [32800] 
939987 [32801] â€œI cannot positively assert,â€ the prosecutor continued, â€œthat the prisoner
939987 [32802] fully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet the idea had
939987 [32803] several times presented itself to him, and he had deliberated on itâ€”for
939987 [32804] that we have facts, witnesses, and his own words. I confess, gentlemen of
939987 [32805] the jury,â€ he added, â€œthat till to-day I have been uncertain whether to
939987 [32806] attribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convinced
939987 [32807] that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured
939987 [32808] it, contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered
939987 [32809] when and how he might commit the crime.
939987 [32810] 
939987 [32811] â€œBut I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was
939987 [32812] presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young ladyâ€™s
939987 [32813] exclamation, â€˜It is the plan, the program of the murder!â€™ That is how she
939987 [32814] defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner. And, in
939987 [32815] fact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was
939987 [32816] premeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now for a
939987 [32817] fact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible
939987 [32818] design, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money next day, he
939987 [32819] would murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes from
939987 [32820] under his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. â€˜As soon as Ivan had gone
939987 [32821] awayâ€™â€”you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every
939987 [32822] circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it. The
939987 [32823] proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committed
939987 [32824] for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written and
939987 [32825] signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.
939987 [32826] 
939987 [32827] â€œI shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not diminish
939987 [32828] the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when drunk what he
939987 [32829] had planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober, he would not
939987 [32830] have written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did he talk about
939987 [32831] it in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it
939987 [32832] to himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when
939987 [32833] he had only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less
939987 [32834] about it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the â€˜Metropolisâ€™ tavern,
939987 [32835] contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking. He did
939987 [32836] not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He did indeed
939987 [32837] turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost unconsciously,
939987 [32838] because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance. It is
939987 [32839] true that after he had taken the final decision, he must have felt
939987 [32840] apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand, and
939987 [32841] that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But there
939987 [32842] was nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck had
939987 [32843] served him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his star, you
939987 [32844] know! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal
939987 [32845] catastrophe. â€˜To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,â€™
939987 [32846] as he writes in his peculiar language, â€˜and if they wonâ€™t give it to me,
939987 [32847] there will be bloodshed.â€™ â€
939987 [32848] 
939987 [32849] Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mityaâ€™s
939987 [32850] efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to Samsonov, his
939987 [32851] journey to Lyagavy. â€œHarassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his watch
939987 [32852] to pay for the journey (though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles
939987 [32853] on himâ€”a likely story), tortured by jealousy at having left the object of
939987 [32854] his affections in the town, suspecting that she would go to Fyodor
939987 [32855] Pavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last to the town, to find, to
939987 [32856] his joy, that she had not been near his father. He accompanied her himself
939987 [32857] to her protector. (Strange to say, he doesnâ€™t seem to have been jealous of
939987 [32858] Samsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to
939987 [32859] his ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a
939987 [32860] fit, that the other servant is illâ€”the coast is clear and he knows the
939987 [32861] â€˜signalsâ€™â€”what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady
939987 [32862] who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly
939987 [32863] esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his
939987 [32864] career with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his
939987 [32865] dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth and
939987 [32866] vigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the
939987 [32867] gold-mines: â€˜that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your
939987 [32868] romantic character, your thirst for adventure.â€™ â€
939987 [32869] 
939987 [32870] After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the
939987 [32871] prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonovâ€™s, the sudden
939987 [32872] frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion,
939987 [32873] at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father,
939987 [32874] Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of
939987 [32875] chance. â€œHad the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her
939987 [32876] former lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, she
939987 [32877] could only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did not
939987 [32878] kill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false
939987 [32879] mistress.
939987 [32880] 
939987 [32881] â€œBut note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why that?
939987 [32882] Why not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating his plan
939987 [32883] and preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would snatch up
939987 [32884] anything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized for a month
939987 [32885] past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly,
939987 [32886] without hesitation, recognized that it would serve his purpose. So it was
939987 [32887] by no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up
939987 [32888] that fatal pestle. And then we find him in his fatherâ€™s gardenâ€”the coast
939987 [32889] is clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicion
939987 [32890] that she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhaps
939987 [32891] laughing at him at that momentâ€”took his breath away. And it was not mere
939987 [32892] suspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must be there, in that
939987 [32893] lighted room, she must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man would
939987 [32894] have us believe that he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in,
939987 [32895] and discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should
939987 [32896] happen. And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his
939987 [32897] character, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he knew the
939987 [32898] signals by which he could at once enter the house.â€ At this point Ippolit
939987 [32899] Kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of
939987 [32900] Smerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and every
939987 [32901] one realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion, he
939987 [32902] thought the subject of great importance.

939987 [32905] 
939987 [32906] Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov
939987 [32907] 
939987 [32908] 
939987 [32909] â€œTo begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?â€ (Ippolit
939987 [32910] Kirillovitch began.) â€œThe first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had
939987 [32911] committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest,
939987 [32912] yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to
939987 [32913] confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is
939987 [32914] confirmed by three persons onlyâ€”the two brothers of the prisoner and
939987 [32915] Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only
939987 [32916] to-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know
939987 [32917] that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of
939987 [32918] his brotherâ€™s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that
939987 [32919] later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact
939987 [32920] to support his notion of Smerdyakovâ€™s guilt, and has only been led to that
939987 [32921] conclusion from the prisonerâ€™s own words and the expression of his face.
939987 [32922] Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice
939987 [32923] to-day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. â€˜What the
939987 [32924] prisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.â€™ That
939987 [32925] is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons,
939987 [32926] who are all deeply concerned in the prisonerâ€™s fate. And yet the theory of
939987 [32927] Smerdyakovâ€™s guilt has been noised about, has been and is still
939987 [32928] maintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?â€
939987 [32929] 
939987 [32930] Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality
939987 [32931] of Smerdyakov, â€œwho had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.â€ He
939987 [32932] depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education,
939987 [32933] who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his level
939987 [32934] and certain modern theories of duty, which he learnt in practice from the
939987 [32935] reckless life of his master, who was also perhaps his fatherâ€”Fyodor
939987 [32936] Pavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophical
939987 [32937] conversations with his masterâ€™s elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily
939987 [32938] indulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse
939987 [32939] himself at the valetâ€™s expense. â€œHe spoke to me himself of his spiritual
939987 [32940] condition during the last few days at his fatherâ€™s house,â€ Ippolit
939987 [32941] Kirillovitch explained; â€œbut others too have borne witness to itâ€”the
939987 [32942] prisoner himself, his brother, and the servant Grigoryâ€”that is, all who
939987 [32943] knew him well.
939987 [32944] 
939987 [32945] â€œMoreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy,
939987 [32946] had not the courage of a chicken. â€˜He fell at my feet and kissed them,â€™
939987 [32947] the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how damaging such a
939987 [32948] statement was to himself. â€˜He is an epileptic chicken,â€™ he declared about
939987 [32949] him in his characteristic language. And the prisoner chose him for his
939987 [32950] confidant (we have his own word for it) and he frightened him into
939987 [32951] consenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that capacity he deceived
939987 [32952] his master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with
939987 [32953] the notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into the
939987 [32954] house. How could he help telling him, indeed? â€˜He would have killed me, I
939987 [32955] could see that he would have killed me,â€™ he said at the inquiry, trembling
939987 [32956] and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time arrested
939987 [32957] and could do him no harm. â€˜He suspected me at every instant. In fear and
939987 [32958] trembling I hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he might
939987 [32959] see that I had not deceived him and let me off alive.â€™ Those are his own
939987 [32960] words. I wrote them down and I remember them. â€˜When he began shouting at
939987 [32961] me, I would fall on my knees.â€™
939987 [32962] 
939987 [32963] â€œHe was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his
939987 [32964] master, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So it may
939987 [32965] be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having
939987 [32966] deceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons severely
939987 [32967] afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, always
939987 [32968] prone to continual and morbid self-reproach. They worry over their
939987 [32969] â€˜wickedness,â€™ they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely
939987 [32970] without cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and
939987 [32971] crimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to
939987 [32972] wrong-doing by terror and intimidation.
939987 [32973] 
939987 [32974] â€œHe had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would be
939987 [32975] the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes. When
939987 [32976] Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe,
939987 [32977] Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid to tell him
939987 [32978] plainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints were
939987 [32979] not understood.
939987 [32980] 
939987 [32981] â€œIt must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector,
939987 [32982] whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to
939987 [32983] pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazovâ€™s drunken letter, â€˜I shall
939987 [32984] kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.â€™ So Ivan Fyodorovitchâ€™s presence
939987 [32985] seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house.
939987 [32986] 
939987 [32987] â€œBut he went away, and within an hour of his young masterâ€™s departure
939987 [32988] Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But thatâ€™s perfectly
939987 [32989] intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror and
939987 [32990] despair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of the
939987 [32991] fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might be
939987 [32992] coming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of
939987 [32993] course, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is
939987 [32994] likely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan
939987 [32995] Fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his
939987 [32996] lonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the
939987 [32997] stairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to
939987 [32998] come upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,
939987 [32999] brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks, and
939987 [33000] he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly natural
939987 [33001] occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was shamming
939987 [33002] an attack _on purpose_. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises at
939987 [33003] once, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on? What was he aiming
939987 [33004] at? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the
939987 [33005] doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the
939987 [33006] real. That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for
939987 [33007] such a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, have
939987 [33008] desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just
939987 [33009] before?
939987 [33010] 
939987 [33011] â€œYou see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were
939987 [33012] five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitchâ€™sâ€”Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he did
939987 [33013] not kill himself, thatâ€™s evident); then his servant, Grigory, but he was
939987 [33014] almost killed himself; the third person was Grigoryâ€™s wife, Marfa
939987 [33015] Ignatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering her
939987 [33016] master. Two persons are leftâ€”the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are
939987 [33017] to believe the prisonerâ€™s statement that he is not the murderer, then
939987 [33018] Smerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else
939987 [33019] can be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation
939987 [33020] against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday. Had a shadow of
939987 [33021] suspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I am
939987 [33022] persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse
939987 [33023] Smerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to charge
939987 [33024] Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.
939987 [33025] 
939987 [33026] â€œGentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let us
939987 [33027] even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts
939987 [33028] tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or with the
939987 [33029] assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternativeâ€”that he
939987 [33030] did it alone. If he had killed him it must have been with some object, for
939987 [33031] some advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the
939987 [33032] prisoner had for the murderâ€”hatred, jealousy, and so onâ€”Smerdyakov could
939987 [33033] only have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the
939987 [33034] three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yet
939987 [33035] he tells another personâ€”and a person most closely interested, that is, the
939987 [33036] prisonerâ€”everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope
939987 [33037] lay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all,
939987 [33038] told him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do
939987 [33039] this simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who
939987 [33040] would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? â€˜Yes,â€™ I shall be told,
939987 [33041] â€˜but he betrayed it from fear.â€™ But how do you explain this? A man who
939987 [33042] could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells
939987 [33043] facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held
939987 [33044] his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!
939987 [33045] 
939987 [33046] â€œNo, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, nothing
939987 [33047] would have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals,
939987 [33048] for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He would have
939987 [33049] invented something, he would have told some lie if he had been forced to
939987 [33050] give information, but he would have been silent about that. For, on the
939987 [33051] other hand, if he had said nothing about the money, but had committed the
939987 [33052] murder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged him
939987 [33053] with murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the
939987 [33054] money, no one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had
939987 [33055] been accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had
939987 [33056] committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed any
939987 [33057] such motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, that
939987 [33058] his master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence, he would,
939987 [33059] of course, have been the last to be suspected. People would have suspected
939987 [33060] first the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he had such
939987 [33061] motives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected
939987 [33062] the son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed
939987 [33063] and robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course,
939987 [33064] have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the
939987 [33065] murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the
939987 [33066] signals? Is that logical? Is that clear?
939987 [33067] 
939987 [33068] â€œWhen the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him
939987 [33069] falling downstairs in a _feigned_ fitâ€”with what object? In the first place
939987 [33070] that Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might put it
939987 [33071] off and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house,
939987 [33072] and, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing that there was
939987 [33073] no one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his son, might redouble
939987 [33074] his vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he,
939987 [33075] Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where
939987 [33076] he always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and out
939987 [33077] as he liked, to Grigoryâ€™s room at the other end of the lodge, where he was
939987 [33078] always put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This was
939987 [33079] the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted Marfa
939987 [33080] Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying behind the screen, he
939987 [33081] would most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and so
939987 [33082] keeping them awake all night (as Grigory and his wife testified). And all
939987 [33083] this, we are to believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murder
939987 [33084] his master!
939987 [33085] 
939987 [33086] â€œBut I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not
939987 [33087] be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals to
939987 [33088] tempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him and had gone
939987 [33089] away with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people,
939987 [33090] Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went inâ€”what for? To murder his
939987 [33091] master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen?
939987 [33092] Gentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,
939987 [33093] but, incredible as it seems, thatâ€™s just what the prisoner alleges. When
939987 [33094] he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, he
939987 [33095] tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his master and stole the
939987 [33096] money! I wonâ€™t press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned
939987 [33097] on this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son
939987 [33098] would simply come to peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and
939987 [33099] beat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put
939987 [33100] this question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could
939987 [33101] have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you canâ€™t accuse him.
939987 [33102] 
939987 [33103] â€œBut, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,
939987 [33104] heard a shout, and went out. Wellâ€”what then? He looked about him and said,
939987 [33105] â€˜Why not go and kill the master?â€™ And how did he know what had happened,
939987 [33106] since he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But thereâ€™s a limit
939987 [33107] to these flights of fancy.
939987 [33108] 
939987 [33109] â€œ â€˜Quite so,â€™ some astute people will tell me, â€˜but what if they were in
939987 [33110] agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the moneyâ€”what
939987 [33111] then?â€™ A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are
939987 [33112] astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his
939987 [33113] accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion
939987 [33114] in every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would be
939987 [33115] interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to
939987 [33116] form such an insane plan.
939987 [33117] 
939987 [33118] â€œBut perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakovâ€™s part,
939987 [33119] but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and
939987 [33120] agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamed
939987 [33121] for letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help or
939987 [33122] resisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get
939987 [33123] out of the way by shamming a fitâ€”â€˜you may murder him as you like; itâ€™s
939987 [33124] nothing to me.â€™ But as this attack of Smerdyakovâ€™s was bound to throw the
939987 [33125] household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such
939987 [33126] a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, it
939987 [33127] would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the
939987 [33128] instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an
939987 [33129] accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror.
939987 [33130] 
939987 [33131] â€œBut what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly
939987 [33132] throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being his
939987 [33133] accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. â€˜He did it alone,â€™ he says.
939987 [33134] â€˜He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.â€™ Strange sort
939987 [33135] of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of the
939987 [33136] risk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while his accomplice lay
939987 [33137] in bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented
939987 [33138] it and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he
939987 [33139] might well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was
939987 [33140] responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished,
939987 [33141] it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But in that case he
939987 [33142] would have been certain to make a confession, yet he has not done so.
939987 [33143] Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murderer
939987 [33144] persisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crime
939987 [33145] alone.
939987 [33146] 
939987 [33147] â€œWhatâ€™s more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it
939987 [33148] was _he_ who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the
939987 [33149] signals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about them. If
939987 [33150] he had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily have made this
939987 [33151] statement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to conceal
939987 [33152] it, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was far from distorting
939987 [33153] or minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being
939987 [33154] charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit of
939987 [33155] melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himself
939987 [33156] yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language, â€˜I destroy
939987 [33157] myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.â€™
939987 [33158] What would it have cost him to add: â€˜I am the murderer, not Karamazovâ€™?
939987 [33159] But that he did not add. Did his conscience lead him to suicide and not to
939987 [33160] avowing his guilt?
939987 [33161] 
939987 [33162] â€œAnd what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the
939987 [33163] court just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in the
939987 [33164] envelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had received
939987 [33165] them from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the painful
939987 [33166] scene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones
939987 [33167] as might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be
939987 [33168] overlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money
939987 [33169] and hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessed
939987 [33170] his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so,
939987 [33171] indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? And so,
939987 [33172] if he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow the whole
939987 [33173] truth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the innocent
939987 [33174] prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?
939987 [33175] 
939987 [33176] â€œThe money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came
939987 [33177] to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan
939987 [33178] Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousand
939987 [33179] eachâ€”that is, ten thousand in allâ€”to the chief town of the province to be
939987 [33180] changed. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and
939987 [33181] that it canâ€™t be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor
939987 [33182] Pavlovitchâ€™s envelope.
939987 [33183] 
939987 [33184] â€œIvan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such
939987 [33185] importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didnâ€™t he report it
939987 [33186] at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to
939987 [33187] conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had
939987 [33188] admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was
939987 [33189] suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on
939987 [33190] the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down
939987 [33191] to-day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakovâ€™s death, and at
939987 [33192] once reflected, â€˜The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my
939987 [33193] brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov
939987 [33194] gave them me before his death.â€™ You will say that was dishonorable: itâ€™s
939987 [33195] dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True,
939987 [33196] but what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by
939987 [33197] the sudden news of the valetâ€™s death, he imagined it really was so? You
939987 [33198] saw the recent scene: you have seen the witnessâ€™s condition. He was
939987 [33199] standing up and was speaking, but where was his mind?
939987 [33200] 
939987 [33201] â€œThen followed the document, the prisonerâ€™s letter written two days before
939987 [33202] the crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why, then, are
939987 [33203] we looking for any other program? The crime was committed precisely
939987 [33204] according to this program, and by no other than the writer of it. Yes,
939987 [33205] gentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not run
939987 [33206] respectfully and timidly away from his fatherâ€™s window, though he was
939987 [33207] firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him. No, that
939987 [33208] is absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed
939987 [33209] him in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated
939987 [33210] rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass pestle,
939987 [33211] and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she was not
939987 [33212] there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the pillow and
939987 [33213] take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the table
939987 [33214] before us.
939987 [33215] 
939987 [33216] â€œI mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very
939987 [33217] characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and had
939987 [33218] he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have left the
939987 [33219] torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse? Had it been
939987 [33220] Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him, he would have
939987 [33221] simply carried away the envelope with him, without troubling himself to
939987 [33222] open it over his victimâ€™s corpse, for he would have known for certain that
939987 [33223] the notes were in the envelopeâ€”they had been put in and sealed up in his
939987 [33224] presenceâ€”and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have
939987 [33225] known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved
939987 [33226] in that way? Would he have left the envelope on the floor?
939987 [33227] 
939987 [33228] â€œNo, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not a
939987 [33229] thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes from
939987 [33230] under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizing
939987 [33231] his own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was the idea
939987 [33232] which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard
939987 [33233] to that money. And pouncing upon the envelope, which he had never seen
939987 [33234] before, he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran
939987 [33235] away with the money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had
939987 [33236] left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope
939987 [33237] on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he didnâ€™t
939987 [33238] think, he didnâ€™t reflect, and how should he? He ran away; he heard behind
939987 [33239] him the servant cry out; the old man caught him, stopped him and was
939987 [33240] felled to the ground by the brass pestle.
939987 [33241] 
939987 [33242] â€œThe prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you believe
939987 [33243] it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to see
939987 [33244] whether he could do anything for him. Was that a moment to show
939987 [33245] compassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only
939987 [33246] witness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other feeling, any other
939987 [33247] motive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped
939987 [33248] his head with his handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran
939987 [33249] to the house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it he
939987 [33250] never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once
939987 [33251] detected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice
939987 [33252] that he was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very
939987 [33253] possible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On one point
939987 [33254] they will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape them
939987 [33255] altogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one thing onlyâ€”where was
939987 [33256] _she_? He wanted to find out at once where she was, so he ran to her
939987 [33257] lodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of newsâ€”she had gone
939987 [33258] off to Mokroe to meet her first lover.â€
939987 [33259]

939987 [33261] 
939987 [33262] Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutorâ€™s Speech.
939987 [33263] 
939987 [33264] 
939987 [33265] Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition,
939987 [33266] beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on
939987 [33267] their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his speech he went off into a
939987 [33268] dissertation on Grushenkaâ€™s â€œfirst lover,â€ and brought forward several
939987 [33269] interesting thoughts on this theme.
939987 [33270] 
939987 [33271] â€œKaramazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, so
939987 [33272] to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What makes
939987 [33273] it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this
939987 [33274] formidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote danger, and
939987 [33275] Karamazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded him as a
939987 [33276] fiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been
939987 [33277] concealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but a
939987 [33278] fiction to her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this
939987 [33279] instantly, he resigned himself.
939987 [33280] 
939987 [33281] â€œGentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in
939987 [33282] the prisonerâ€™s character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for
939987 [33283] justice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love. And
939987 [33284] all this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with his
939987 [33285] fatherâ€™s blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had shed was
939987 [33286] already crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul and
939987 [33287] his life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instant
939987 [33288] what he was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him
939987 [33289] than his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned
939987 [33290] penitent, with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with honorable
939987 [33291] offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life. And he, luckless
939987 [33292] man, what could he give her now, what could he offer her?
939987 [33293] 
939987 [33294] â€œKaramazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by his
939987 [33295] crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with life
939987 [33296] before him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to one
939987 [33297] frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazovâ€™s character, must have appeared
939987 [33298] the one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way out was
939987 [33299] suicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friend
939987 [33300] Perhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money,
939987 [33301] for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his fatherâ€™s gore. Oh,
939987 [33302] now he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
939987 [33303] shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a poet and
939987 [33304] had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. â€˜To her, to her! and
939987 [33305] there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never was
939987 [33306] before, that will be remembered and talked of long after! In the midst of
939987 [33307] shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise
939987 [33308] the glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness! And
939987 [33309] then, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and
939987 [33310] punish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see
939987 [33311] how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!â€™
939987 [33312] 
939987 [33313] â€œHere we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and
939987 [33314] sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but
939987 [33315] there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out
939987 [33316] in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto
939987 [33317] deathâ€”that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment,
939987 [33318] its terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is
939987 [33319] the only way out! But _beyond_â€”I donâ€™t know whether Karamazov wondered at
939987 [33320] that moment â€˜What lies beyond,â€™ and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet,
939987 [33321] wonder â€˜What lies beyond.â€™ No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their
939987 [33322] Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!â€
939987 [33323] 
939987 [33324] Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mityaâ€™s preparations,
939987 [33325] the scene at Perhotinâ€™s, at the shop, with the drivers. He quoted numerous
939987 [33326] words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terrible
939987 [33327] impression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man
939987 [33328] stood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.
939987 [33329] 
939987 [33330] â€œWhat need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost confessed,
939987 [33331] hinted at it, all but spoke out.â€ (Then followed the evidence given by
939987 [33332] witnesses.) â€œHe even cried out to the peasant who drove him, â€˜Do you know,
939987 [33333] you are driving a murderer!â€™ But it was impossible for him to speak out,
939987 [33334] he had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his romance. But what was
939987 [33335] awaiting the luckless man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw
939987 [33336] that his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the
939987 [33337] toast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be
939987 [33338] acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the
939987 [33339] preliminary inquiry. Karamazovâ€™s triumph over his rival was complete and
939987 [33340] his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phase
939987 [33341] through which his soul has passed or will pass.
939987 [33342] 
939987 [33343] â€œOne may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,â€ the prosecutor
939987 [33344] continued, â€œthat outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own
939987 [33345] vengeance more completely than any earthly justice. Whatâ€™s more, justice
939987 [33346] and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and
939987 [33347] are, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as its
939987 [33348] salvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror and moral
939987 [33349] suffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him, that for his
939987 [33350] sake she had rejected her first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya,
939987 [33351] to a new life, that she was promising him happinessâ€”and when? When
939987 [33352] everything was over for him and nothing was possible!
939987 [33353] 
939987 [33354] â€œBy the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the
939987 [33355] light it throws on the prisonerâ€™s position at the moment. This woman, this
939987 [33356] love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant of his
939987 [33357] arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him but
939987 [33358] unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he relinquish
939987 [33359] his design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just that
939987 [33360] passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained
939987 [33361] him. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress, who was
939987 [33362] at the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than
939987 [33363] everâ€”he did not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.
939987 [33364] 
939987 [33365] â€œHis passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest,
939987 [33366] but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for a moment!
939987 [33367] I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by
939987 [33368] these influencesâ€”first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement,
939987 [33369] of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her, flushed
939987 [33370] with wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in
939987 [33371] the background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till
939987 [33372] next morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a few
939987 [33373] hours and thatâ€™s much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many
939987 [33374] things. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when
939987 [33375] they are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street
939987 [33376] to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then there
939987 [33377] will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street
939987 [33378] the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning of the journey
939987 [33379] the condemned man, sitting on his shameful cart, must feel that he has
939987 [33380] infinite life still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves onâ€”oh,
939987 [33381] thatâ€™s nothing, itâ€™s still far to the turning into the second street and
939987 [33382] he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously
939987 [33383] curious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that he
939987 [33384] is just such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street.
939987 [33385] Oh, thatâ€™s nothing, nothing, thereâ€™s still a whole street before him, and
939987 [33386] however many houses have been passed, he will still think there are many
939987 [33387] left. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.
939987 [33388] 
939987 [33389] â€œThis I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. â€˜Theyâ€™ve not had time
939987 [33390] yet,â€™ he must have thought, â€˜I may still find some way out, oh, thereâ€™s
939987 [33391] still time to make some plan of defense, and now, nowâ€”she is so
939987 [33392] fascinating!â€™
939987 [33393] 
939987 [33394] â€œHis soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to put
939987 [33395] aside half his money and hide it somewhereâ€”I cannot otherwise explain the
939987 [33396] disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken from
939987 [33397] his fatherâ€™s pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than once before, he had
939987 [33398] caroused there for two days together already, he knew the old big house
939987 [33399] with all its passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money
939987 [33400] was hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice,
939987 [33401] under some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I
939987 [33402] shall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he
939987 [33403] hadnâ€™t yet considered how to meet it, he hadnâ€™t the time, his head was
939987 [33404] throbbing and his heart was with _her_, but moneyâ€”money was indispensable
939987 [33405] in any case! With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at
939987 [33406] such a moment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself that
939987 [33407] a month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his money
939987 [33408] and sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall
939987 [33409] prove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had
939987 [33410] contemplated it. Whatâ€™s more, when he declared at the inquiry that he had
939987 [33411] put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed) he may have
939987 [33412] invented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he had
939987 [33413] two hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at Mokroe till
939987 [33414] morning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself. Two
939987 [33415] extremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate
939987 [33416] two extremes and both at once.
939987 [33417] 
939987 [33418] â€œWe have looked in the house, but we havenâ€™t found the money. It may still
939987 [33419] be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisonerâ€™s
939987 [33420] hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees before her, she
939987 [33421] was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to her and he had so
939987 [33422] entirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the men coming to
939987 [33423] arrest him. He hadnâ€™t time to prepare any line of defense in his mind. He
939987 [33424] was caught unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his
939987 [33425] destiny.
939987 [33426] 
939987 [33427] â€œGentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our duties
939987 [33428] when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his account, too!
939987 [33429] The moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees that
939987 [33430] all is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the moments
939987 [33431] when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he
939987 [33432] looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face,
939987 [33433] your thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his distracted
939987 [33434] mind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to
939987 [33435] speak, afraid of giving himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this
939987 [33436] animal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the
939987 [33437] human soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the
939987 [33438] criminal even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.
939987 [33439] 
939987 [33440] â€œAt first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very
939987 [33441] compromising phrases. â€˜Blood! Iâ€™ve deserved it!â€™ But he quickly restrained
939987 [33442] himself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer he was to
939987 [33443] make, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. â€˜I am not guilty of my
939987 [33444] fatherâ€™s death.â€™ That was his fence for the moment and behind it he hoped
939987 [33445] to throw up a barricade of some sort. His first compromising exclamations
939987 [33446] he hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death
939987 [33447] of the servant Grigory only. â€˜Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has
939987 [33448] killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him,
939987 [33449] _if not I_?â€™ Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask him
939987 [33450] that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature
939987 [33451] hasteâ€”â€˜if not Iâ€™â€”the animal cunning, the naÃ¯vetÃ©, the Karamazov impatience
939987 [33452] of it? â€˜I didnâ€™t kill him and you mustnâ€™t think I did! I wanted to kill
939987 [33453] him, gentlemen, I wanted to kill him,â€™ he hastens to admit (he was in a
939987 [33454] hurry, in a terrible hurry), â€˜but still I am not guilty, it is not I
939987 [33455] murdered him.â€™ He concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though
939987 [33456] to say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so youâ€™ll believe
939987 [33457] all the sooner that I didnâ€™t murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is
939987 [33458] often amazingly shallow and credulous.
939987 [33459] 
939987 [33460] â€œAt that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally, the
939987 [33461] most simple question, â€˜Wasnâ€™t it Smerdyakov killed him?â€™ Then, as we
939987 [33462] expected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught
939987 [33463] him unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the
939987 [33464] moment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakovâ€™s name. He
939987 [33465] rushed at once to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to
939987 [33466] assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of
939987 [33467] it. But donâ€™t believe him, that was only his cunning; he didnâ€™t really
939987 [33468] give up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him
939987 [33469] forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but he
939987 [33470] would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him.
939987 [33471] He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later,
939987 [33472] choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, â€˜You know I was more skeptical
939987 [33473] about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I am
939987 [33474] convinced. He killed him, he must have done!â€™ And for the present he falls
939987 [33475] back upon a gloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted
939987 [33476] him, however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he
939987 [33477] looked into his fatherâ€™s window and how he respectfully withdrew. The
939987 [33478] worst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the
939987 [33479] evidence given by Grigory.
939987 [33480] 
939987 [33481] â€œWe proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him, the
939987 [33482] whole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it. And no
939987 [33483] doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bag
939987 [33484] first occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of the
939987 [33485] improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more
939987 [33486] likely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In such
939987 [33487] cases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is to
939987 [33488] prevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly so
939987 [33489] that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity,
939987 [33490] improbability and inconsistency. The criminal can only be made to speak by
939987 [33491] the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of
939987 [33492] some circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had no
939987 [33493] previous idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in
939987 [33494] readinessâ€”that was Grigoryâ€™s evidence about the open door through which
939987 [33495] the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about that door and
939987 [33496] had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.
939987 [33497] 
939987 [33498] â€œThe effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, â€˜Then
939987 [33499] Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!â€™ and so betrayed the basis of
939987 [33500] the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbable
939987 [33501] shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had
939987 [33502] knocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that Grigory saw the
939987 [33503] door was open before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the
939987 [33504] screen as he came out of his bedroomâ€”Karamazov was positively crushed. My
939987 [33505] esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards
939987 [33506] that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improve
939987 [33507] matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little
939987 [33508] bagâ€”so be it, you shall hear this romance!
939987 [33509] 
939987 [33510] â€œGentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this
939987 [33511] romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that
939987 [33512] could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for a
939987 [33513] bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything more
939987 [33514] incredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can
939987 [33515] always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real
939987 [33516] life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers
939987 [33517] neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for
939987 [33518] such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a
939987 [33519] whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But thatâ€™s
939987 [33520] how they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, â€˜Where did you
939987 [33521] get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?â€™ â€˜I made it
939987 [33522] myself.â€™ â€˜And where did you get the linen?â€™ The prisoner was positively
939987 [33523] offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial
939987 [33524] question, and would you believe it, his resentment was genuine! But they
939987 [33525] are all like that. â€˜I tore it off my shirt.â€™ â€˜Then we shall find that
939987 [33526] shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece torn off.â€™ And only fancy,
939987 [33527] gentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and how
939987 [33528] could we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that
939987 [33529] would have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! But
939987 [33530] he was incapable of that reflection. â€˜I donâ€™t remember, it may not have
939987 [33531] been off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landladyâ€™s caps.â€™ â€˜What sort
939987 [33532] of a cap?â€™ â€˜It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.â€™ â€˜And do you
939987 [33533] remember that clearly?â€™ â€˜No, I donâ€™t.â€™ And he was angry, very angry, and
939987 [33534] yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments of manâ€™s
939987 [33535] life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers just
939987 [33536] such trifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed
939987 [33537] past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a crossâ€”that he will remember. He
939987 [33538] concealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must have
939987 [33539] remembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him
939987 [33540] needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen
939987 [33541] (there is a screen in his lodgings).
939987 [33542] 
939987 [33543] â€œBut, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these
939987 [33544] details, trifles?â€ cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. â€œJust because the
939987 [33545] prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has not
939987 [33546] explained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has not added
939987 [33547] one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements; all those
939987 [33548] are trivialities. â€˜You must believe it on my honor.â€™ Oh, we are glad to
939987 [33549] believe it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honor!
939987 [33550] Are we jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in the
939987 [33551] prisonerâ€™s favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real
939987 [33552] fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisonerâ€™s expression by his own
939987 [33553] brother, or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to
939987 [33554] point to the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new
939987 [33555] fact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to
939987 [33556] repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot
939987 [33557] repudiate anything.â€
939987 [33558] 
939987 [33559] Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as though
939987 [33560] he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the
939987 [33561] blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery!
939987 [33562] He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts.
939987 [33563] 
939987 [33564] â€œAnd whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for
939987 [33565] the defense,â€ Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, â€œwhatever
939987 [33566] eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember
939987 [33567] that at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you are
939987 [33568] the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her
939987 [33569] principles, her family, everything that she holds sacred! Yes, you
939987 [33570] represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not
939987 [33571] in this hall only but will reÃ«cho throughout the whole of Russia, and all
939987 [33572] Russia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be
939987 [33573] encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and
939987 [33574] her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight
939987 [33575] perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched
939987 [33576] out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. And
939987 [33577] if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from
939987 [33578] respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. From
939987 [33579] horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, but
939987 [33580] maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall
939987 [33581] confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of
939987 [33582] our lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and
939987 [33583] civilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they
939987 [33584] already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing
939987 [33585] hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!â€
939987 [33586] 
939987 [33587] Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech
939987 [33588] with this rhetorical appealâ€”and the effect produced by him was
939987 [33589] extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and,
939987 [33590] as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room. There
939987 [33591] was no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. The ladies
939987 [33592] were not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with his
939987 [33593] eloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the
939987 [33594] trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. â€œHe will speak at last and of
939987 [33595] course carry all before him.â€
939987 [33596] 
939987 [33597] Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the
939987 [33598] prosecutorâ€™s speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and his
939987 [33599] head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened,
939987 [33600] especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the prosecutor mentioned
939987 [33601] Rakitinâ€™s opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over his
939987 [33602] face and he murmured rather audibly, â€œThe Bernards!â€ When Ippolit
939987 [33603] Kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe,
939987 [33604] Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At one point he
939987 [33605] seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only
939987 [33606] shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end
939987 [33607] of the speech, of the prosecutorâ€™s feat in examining the prisoner at
939987 [33608] Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. â€œThe man could not resist
939987 [33609] boasting of his cleverness,â€ they said.
939987 [33610] 
939987 [33611] The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an
939987 [33612] hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and
939987 [33613] exclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.
939987 [33614] 
939987 [33615] â€œA weighty speech,â€ a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
939987 [33616] 
939987 [33617] â€œHe brought in too much psychology,â€ said another voice.
939987 [33618] 
939987 [33619] â€œBut it was all true, the absolute truth!â€
939987 [33620] 
939987 [33621] â€œYes, he is first rate at it.â€
939987 [33622] 
939987 [33623] â€œHe summed it all up.â€
939987 [33624] 
939987 [33625] â€œYes, he summed us up, too,â€ chimed in another voice. â€œDo you remember, at
939987 [33626] the beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor
939987 [33627] Pavlovitch?â€
939987 [33628] 
939987 [33629] â€œAnd at the end, too. But that was all rot.â€
939987 [33630] 
939987 [33631] â€œAnd obscure too.â€
939987 [33632] 
939987 [33633] â€œHe was a little too much carried away.â€
939987 [33634] 
939987 [33635] â€œItâ€™s unjust, itâ€™s unjust.â€
939987 [33636] 
939987 [33637] â€œNo, it was smartly done, anyway. Heâ€™s had long to wait, but heâ€™s had his
939987 [33638] say, ha ha!â€
939987 [33639] 
939987 [33640] â€œWhat will the counsel for the defense say?â€
939987 [33641] 
939987 [33642] In another group I heard:
939987 [33643] 
939987 [33644] â€œHe had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that;
939987 [33645] â€˜appealing to your sensibilitiesâ€™â€”do you remember?â€
939987 [33646] 
939987 [33647] â€œYes, that was awkward of him.â€
939987 [33648] 
939987 [33649] â€œHe was in too great a hurry.â€
939987 [33650] 
939987 [33651] â€œHe is a nervous man.â€
939987 [33652] 
939987 [33653] â€œWe laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?â€
939987 [33654] 
939987 [33655] â€œYes, what must it be for Mitya?â€
939987 [33656] 
939987 [33657] In a third group:
939987 [33658] 
939987 [33659] â€œWhat lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the end?â€
939987 [33660] 
939987 [33661] â€œShe is a generalâ€™s wife, divorced, I know her.â€
939987 [33662] 
939987 [33663] â€œThatâ€™s why she has the lorgnette.â€
939987 [33664] 
939987 [33665] â€œShe is not good for much.â€
939987 [33666] 
939987 [33667] â€œOh, no, she is a piquante little woman.â€
939987 [33668] 
939987 [33669] â€œTwo places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.â€
939987 [33670] 
939987 [33671] â€œThey caught him smartly at Mokroe, didnâ€™t they, eh?â€
939987 [33672] 
939987 [33673] â€œOh, it was smart enough. Weâ€™ve heard it before, how often he has told the
939987 [33674] story at peopleâ€™s houses!â€
939987 [33675] 
939987 [33676] â€œAnd he couldnâ€™t resist doing it now. Thatâ€™s vanity.â€
939987 [33677] 
939987 [33678] â€œHe is a man with a grievance, he he!â€
939987 [33679] 
939987 [33680] â€œYes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, such
939987 [33681] long sentences.â€
939987 [33682] 
939987 [33683] â€œYes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you remember
939987 [33684] about the troika? Something about â€˜They have Hamlets, but we have, so far,
939987 [33685] only Karamazovs!â€™ That was cleverly said!â€
939987 [33686] 
939987 [33687] â€œThat was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.â€
939987 [33688] 
939987 [33689] â€œYes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.â€
939987 [33690] 
939987 [33691] â€œYes, what will Fetyukovitch say?â€
939987 [33692] 
939987 [33693] â€œWhatever he says, he wonâ€™t get round our peasants.â€
939987 [33694] 
939987 [33695] â€œDonâ€™t you think so?â€
939987 [33696] 
939987 [33697] A fourth group:
939987 [33698] 
939987 [33699] â€œWhat he said about the troika was good, that piece about the other
939987 [33700] nations.â€
939987 [33701] 
939987 [33702] â€œAnd that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.â€
939987 [33703] 
939987 [33704] â€œWhat do you mean?â€
939987 [33705] 
939987 [33706] â€œWhy, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speaking
939987 [33707] about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to
939987 [33708] intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of him,
939987 [33709] I know he was. He was talking about that last week.â€
939987 [33710] 
939987 [33711] â€œNot an easy job.â€
939987 [33712] 
939987 [33713] â€œNot an easy job? Why not?â€
939987 [33714] 
939987 [33715] â€œWhy, weâ€™d shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where would
939987 [33716] they get it?â€
939987 [33717] 
939987 [33718] â€œIn America. They get it from America now.â€
939987 [33719] 
939987 [33720] â€œNonsense!â€
939987 [33721] 
939987 [33722] But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted the
939987 [33723] tribune.
939987 [33724] 
939987 [33725] 
939987 [33726] 
939987 [33727] Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways
939987 [33728] 
939987 [33729] 
939987 [33730] All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The eyes
939987 [33731] of the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and directly,
939987 [33732] with an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit. He made
939987 [33733] no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a
939987 [33734] man speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice
939987 [33735] was a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine
939987 [33736] and simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that
939987 [33737] the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and â€œpierce the heart
939987 [33738] with untold power.â€ His language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit
939987 [33739] Kirillovitchâ€™s, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with more
939987 [33740] precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending forward,
939987 [33741] especially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but as
939987 [33742] though he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long spine in
939987 [33743] half, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bend
939987 [33744] almost at right angles.
939987 [33745] 
939987 [33746] At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, without
939987 [33747] system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end,
939987 [33748] these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts,
939987 [33749] the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimes
939987 [33750] malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly changed his
939987 [33751] tone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed
939987 [33752] on the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.
939987 [33753] 
939987 [33754] He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he
939987 [33755] practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns to
939987 [33756] defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least a
939987 [33757] preconceived idea. â€œThat is what has happened to me in the present case,â€
939987 [33758] he explained. â€œFrom the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck
939987 [33759] by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisonerâ€™s favor. What
939987 [33760] interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but
939987 [33761] rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present
939987 [33762] case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech,
939987 [33763] but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to
939987 [33764] work directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my
939987 [33765] material. That may be imprudent on my part, but at least itâ€™s sincere.
939987 [33766] What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence
939987 [33767] against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will stand
939987 [33768] criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the case more
939987 [33769] closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly
939987 [33770] received from the prisonerâ€™s relatives a request to undertake his defense.
939987 [33771] I at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to
939987 [33772] break down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of
939987 [33773] evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the
939987 [33774] case.â€
939987 [33775] 
939987 [33776] So Fetyukovitch began.
939987 [33777] 
939987 [33778] â€œGentlemen of the jury,â€ he suddenly protested, â€œI am new to this
939987 [33779] district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulent
939987 [33780] and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has insulted perhaps
939987 [33781] hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people against
939987 [33782] him beforehand. Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of local
939987 [33783] society is justly excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent and
939987 [33784] violent temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcome
939987 [33785] in the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor.â€
939987 [33786] 
939987 [33787] (N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,
939987 [33788] quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the prosecutor
939987 [33789] received Mitya against his will, solely because he had somehow interested
939987 [33790] his wifeâ€”a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful,
939987 [33791] capricious, and fond of opposing her husband, especially in trifles.
939987 [33792] Mityaâ€™s visits, however, had not been frequent.)
939987 [33793] 
939987 [33794] â€œNevertheless I venture to suggest,â€ Fetyukovitch continued, â€œthat in
939987 [33795] spite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may have
939987 [33796] formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client. Oh, that is so
939987 [33797] natural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice.
939987 [33798] Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless. We
939987 [33799] have, in the talented prosecutorâ€™s speech, heard a stern analysis of the
939987 [33800] prisonerâ€™s character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the
939987 [33801] case was evident. And, whatâ€™s more, he went into psychological subtleties
939987 [33802] into which he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and
939987 [33803] malicious prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are
939987 [33804] even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious and
939987 [33805] consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away by the
939987 [33806] artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance,
939987 [33807] especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight. Before I
939987 [33808] started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware,
939987 [33809] that I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight
939987 [33810] and subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recent
939987 [33811] years. But profound as psychology is, itâ€™s a knife that cuts both ways.â€
939987 [33812] (Laughter among the public.) â€œYou will, of course, forgive me my
939987 [33813] comparison; I canâ€™t boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example any
939987 [33814] point in the prosecutorâ€™s speech.
939987 [33815] 
939987 [33816] â€œThe prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the
939987 [33817] fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass
939987 [33818] pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over
939987 [33819] the man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the
939987 [33820] prosecutor refuses to believe the prisonerâ€™s statement that he ran to old
939987 [33821] Grigory out of pity. â€˜No,â€™ he says, â€˜such sensibility is impossible at
939987 [33822] such a moment, thatâ€™s unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only
939987 [33823] witness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had
939987 [33824] committed the murder, since he would not have run back for any other
939987 [33825] reason.â€™
939987 [33826] 
939987 [33827] â€œHere you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to
939987 [33828] the case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable. The
939987 [33829] murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whether
939987 [33830] the witness was alive or not, yet he had left in his murdered fatherâ€™s
939987 [33831] study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence in
939987 [33832] the shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had been
939987 [33833] three thousand roubles in it. â€˜If he had carried that envelope away with
939987 [33834] him, no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the
939987 [33835] notes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.â€™ Those
939987 [33836] are the prosecutorâ€™s own words. So on one side you see a complete absence
939987 [33837] of precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright,
939987 [33838] leaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed
939987 [33839] another man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating
939987 [33840] foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological
939987 [33841] subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances I
939987 [33842] become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the
939987 [33843] next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and
939987 [33844] cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out
939987 [33845] whether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutes
939987 [33846] looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Why
939987 [33847] soak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may be
939987 [33848] evidence against me later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why
939987 [33849] not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as
939987 [33850] to kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?
939987 [33851] 
939987 [33852] â€œAgain, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left
939987 [33853] another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from the
939987 [33854] two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and
939987 [33855] prove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he had
939987 [33856] forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he
939987 [33857] had flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where
939987 [33858] Grigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at having
939987 [33859] killed a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse,
939987 [33860] as a murderous weapon. Thatâ€™s how it must have been, what other reason
939987 [33861] could he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling
939987 [33862] grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent of
939987 [33863] his fatherâ€™s murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run to
939987 [33864] another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; his
939987 [33865] thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation. He would have had
939987 [33866] none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would
939987 [33867] have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him.
939987 [33868] There was room for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience had
939987 [33869] been clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have
939987 [33870] purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you
939987 [33871] can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.
939987 [33872] Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite
939987 [33873] unconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.â€
939987 [33874] 
939987 [33875] Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were
939987 [33876] again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I will
939987 [33877] only quote some passages from it, some leading points.
939987 [33878] 
939987 [33879] 
939987 [33880] 
939987 [33881] Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery
939987 [33882] 
939987 [33883] 
939987 [33884] There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitchâ€™s speech. He
939987 [33885] flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and
939987 [33886] consequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.
939987 [33887] 
939987 [33888] â€œGentlemen of the jury,â€ he began. â€œEvery new and unprejudiced observer
939987 [33889] must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case,
939987 [33890] namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of proving
939987 [33891] that there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money was
939987 [33892] stolenâ€”three thousand roublesâ€”but whether those roubles ever existed,
939987 [33893] nobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seen
939987 [33894] the notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been put
939987 [33895] in the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the
939987 [33896] prisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe.
939987 [33897] Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three
939987 [33898] persons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them.
939987 [33899] 
939987 [33900] â€œHere the question arises, if itâ€™s true that they did exist, and that
939987 [33901] Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What if
939987 [33902] his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his
939987 [33903] cash-box without telling him? Note, that according to Smerdyakovâ€™s story
939987 [33904] the notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner must have pulled them
939987 [33905] out, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded
939987 [33906] in the protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes without
939987 [33907] disturbing the bed? How could he have helped soiling with his
939987 [33908] blood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had
939987 [33909] been purposely made?
939987 [33910] 
939987 [33911] â€œBut I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, itâ€™s
939987 [33912] worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprised
939987 [33913] just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himselfâ€”of
939987 [33914] himself, observeâ€”that but for that envelope, but for its being left on the
939987 [33915] floor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of that
939987 [33916] envelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisonerâ€™s having
939987 [33917] stolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutorâ€™s own
939987 [33918] admission, the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, â€˜otherwise
939987 [33919] no one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.â€™
939987 [33920] But is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a
939987 [33921] proof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
939987 [33922] Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope.
939987 [33923] But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talked
939987 [33924] to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen the notes two days before
939987 [33925] the catastrophe. Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked
939987 [33926] up alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his
939987 [33927] adoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and
939987 [33928] taking out the notes. â€˜Whatâ€™s the use of the envelope?â€™ he may have asked
939987 [33929] himself. â€˜She wonâ€™t believe the notes are there, but when I show her the
939987 [33930] thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression,
939987 [33931] you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.â€™ And so he tears open the
939987 [33932] envelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor,
939987 [33933] conscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving
939987 [33934] evidence.
939987 [33935] 
939987 [33936] â€œListen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and
939987 [33937] such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the sort
939987 [33938] could have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; if
939987 [33939] there was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the floor
939987 [33940] may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I not
939987 [33941] maintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because the
939987 [33942] money had been taken from it by its owner?
939987 [33943] 
939987 [33944] â€œBut I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch took
939987 [33945] it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the
939987 [33946] house? In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box,
939987 [33947] and secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or the evening
939987 [33948] before to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he may have
939987 [33949] changed his idea, his plan of action completely, without thinking it
939987 [33950] necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is
939987 [33951] the barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so
939987 [33952] positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and
939987 [33953] of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on the
939987 [33954] domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has been stolen, the
939987 [33955] thing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond
939987 [33956] doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.
939987 [33957] 
939987 [33958] â€œNot long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a
939987 [33959] boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad
939987 [33960] daylight into a moneychangerâ€™s shop with an ax, and with extraordinary,
939987 [33961] typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen
939987 [33962] hundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteen
939987 [33963] roubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him.
939987 [33964] Moreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder,
939987 [33965] informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the
939987 [33966] notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notes
939987 [33967] and coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and
939987 [33968] genuine confession on the part of the murderer. Thatâ€™s what I call
939987 [33969] evidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch the
939987 [33970] money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present case?
939987 [33971] And yet it is a question of life and death.
939987 [33972] 
939987 [33973] â€œYes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering money;
939987 [33974] he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roublesâ€”where did he get the
939987 [33975] money? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and the
939987 [33976] other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that money
939987 [33977] was not the same, and had never been in any envelope. By strict
939987 [33978] calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the
939987 [33979] prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotinâ€™s without
939987 [33980] going home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in
939987 [33981] company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half
939987 [33982] and hidden half in the town. Itâ€™s just this consideration that has led the
939987 [33983] prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe.
939987 [33984] Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen? Isnâ€™t this
939987 [33985] supposition really too fantastic and too romantic? And observe, if that
939987 [33986] supposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the
939987 [33987] winds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen
939987 [33988] hundred roubles? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since itâ€™s
939987 [33989] proved the prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a manâ€™s
939987 [33990] life with such tales!
939987 [33991] 
939987 [33992] â€œI shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen
939987 [33993] hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money before
939987 [33994] that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear and
939987 [33995] unflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have it
939987 [33996] so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that
939987 [33997] statement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner.
939987 [33998] The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak will, who
939987 [33999] had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by
939987 [34000] his betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up,
939987 [34001] but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two days and
939987 [34002] taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this,
939987 [34003] you will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no
939987 [34004] contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What if
939987 [34005] youâ€™ve been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man?
939987 [34006] Thatâ€™s just it, you have invented quite a different man!
939987 [34007] 
939987 [34008] â€œI shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day
939987 [34009] all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the
939987 [34010] catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are
939987 [34011] these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court
939987 [34012] already. Besides, in another manâ€™s hand a crust always seems larger, and
939987 [34013] no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at
939987 [34014] sight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty
939987 [34015] thousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a
939987 [34016] two-edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.
939987 [34017] 
939987 [34018] â€œA month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina
939987 [34019] Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. But the question
939987 [34020] is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting and
939987 [34021] degrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first statement made by the
939987 [34022] young lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In the
939987 [34023] second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of
939987 [34024] long-concealed hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her first
939987 [34025] evidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her second piece
939987 [34026] of evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare
939987 [34027] not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch on it
939987 [34028] either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and
939987 [34029] high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady
939987 [34030] unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in
939987 [34031] court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive of
939987 [34032] ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given not
939987 [34033] impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that a revengeful
939987 [34034] woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in
939987 [34035] particular, the insult and humiliation of her offering him the money. No,
939987 [34036] it was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially
939987 [34037] for a man so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he expected to
939987 [34038] receive shortly from his father the three thousand roubles that he
939987 [34039] reckoned was owing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just his
939987 [34040] irresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that his
939987 [34041] father would give him the money, that he would get it, and so could always
939987 [34042] dispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt.
939987 [34043] 
939987 [34044] â€œBut the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set
939987 [34045] aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. Thatâ€™s not his
939987 [34046] character, he tells us, he couldnâ€™t have had such feelings. But yet he
939987 [34047] talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two
939987 [34048] extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such
939987 [34049] a two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved
939987 [34050] by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if
939987 [34051] something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is
939987 [34052] loveâ€”that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he
939987 [34053] needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she
939987 [34054] were to say to him, â€˜I am yours, I wonâ€™t have Fyodor Pavlovitch,â€™ then he
939987 [34055] must have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing.
939987 [34056] Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was
939987 [34057] suffering fromâ€”what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and
939987 [34058] concealing it in case of emergency?
939987 [34059] 
939987 [34060] â€œBut time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the
939987 [34061] expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant
939987 [34062] to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. â€˜If Fyodor
939987 [34063] Pavlovitch doesnâ€™t give the money,â€™ he thought, â€˜I shall be put in the
939987 [34064] position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.â€™ And then the idea presented
939987 [34065] itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the
939987 [34066] fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, â€˜I am a
939987 [34067] scoundrel, but not a thief.â€™ So here we have already a twofold reason why
939987 [34068] he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he
939987 [34069] shouldnâ€™t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why
939987 [34070] should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of
939987 [34071] honor, granted that itâ€™s misplaced, granted itâ€™s often mistaken, yet it
939987 [34072] exists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.
939987 [34073] 
939987 [34074] â€œBut now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments reach
939987 [34075] a climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and
939987 [34076] more: â€˜If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go off
939987 [34077] with Grushenka?â€™ If he behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the
939987 [34078] taverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he was
939987 [34079] wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions
939987 [34080] became so acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his
939987 [34081] younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles,
939987 [34082] but without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating the
939987 [34083] old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect of
939987 [34084] getting it from any one; his father would not give it him after that
939987 [34085] beating.
939987 [34086] 
939987 [34087] â€œThe same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper part
939987 [34088] of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother that he
939987 [34089] had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would remain a
939987 [34090] scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means, that he
939987 [34091] wouldnâ€™t have the character, that he wouldnâ€™t have the will-power to do
939987 [34092] it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey
939987 [34093] Karamazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously and
939987 [34094] convincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe in
939987 [34095] money hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?
939987 [34096] 
939987 [34097] â€œThe same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wrote
939987 [34098] that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proof
939987 [34099] of the prisoner having committed robbery! â€˜I shall beg from every one, and
939987 [34100] if I donâ€™t get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope
939987 [34101] with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan has
939987 [34102] gone.â€™ A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he.
939987 [34103] â€˜It has all been done as he wrote,â€™ cries the prosecutor.
939987 [34104] 
939987 [34105] â€œBut in the first place, itâ€™s the letter of a drunken man and written in
939987 [34106] great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he has
939987 [34107] heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope himself; and
939987 [34108] thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he did it? Did the
939987 [34109] prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he find the money,
939987 [34110] did that money exist indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ran
939987 [34111] off, if you remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out
939987 [34112] where she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry
939987 [34113] out a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act
939987 [34114] of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous
939987 [34115] fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered him he
939987 [34116] seized the money, too. But did he murder him after all? The charge of
939987 [34117] robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery,
939987 [34118] if itâ€™s impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; thatâ€™s an
939987 [34119] axiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is
939987 [34120] that proved? Isnâ€™t that, too, a romance?â€
939987 [34121] 
939987 [34122] 
939987 [34123] 
939987 [34124] Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either
939987 [34125] 
939987 [34126] 
939987 [34127] â€œAllow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a manâ€™s life is at
939987 [34128] stake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor himself
939987 [34129] admit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and
939987 [34130] conscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal
939987 [34131] drunken letter which was produced in court to-day. â€˜All was done as
939987 [34132] written.â€™ But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely
939987 [34133] to find out where she was. Thatâ€™s a fact that canâ€™t be disputed. Had she
939987 [34134] been at home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at her
939987 [34135] side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ran
939987 [34136] unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did not
939987 [34137] even remember his drunken letter. â€˜He snatched up the pestle,â€™ they say,
939987 [34138] and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that
939987 [34139] pestleâ€”why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it
939987 [34140] up, and so on, and so on. A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this
939987 [34141] point: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on
939987 [34142] the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put
939987 [34143] away in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisonerâ€™s eye, and he
939987 [34144] would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he would
939987 [34145] certainly not have killed any one. How then can I look upon the pestle as
939987 [34146] a proof of premeditation?
939987 [34147] 
939987 [34148] â€œYes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two days
939987 [34149] before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was quiet and
939987 [34150] only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could not
939987 [34151] help quarreling, forsooth! But my answer to that is, that, if he was
939987 [34152] planning such a murder in accordance with his letter, he certainly would
939987 [34153] not have quarreled even with a shopman, and probably would not have gone
939987 [34154] into the tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet
939987 [34155] and retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard,
939987 [34156] and that not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,
939987 [34157] the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can use it.
939987 [34158] As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month, donâ€™t we often
939987 [34159] hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns shout, â€˜Iâ€™ll kill youâ€™?
939987 [34160] but they donâ€™t murder any one. And that fatal letterâ€”isnâ€™t that simply
939987 [34161] drunken irritability, too? Isnâ€™t that simply the shout of the brawler
939987 [34162] outside the tavern, â€˜Iâ€™ll kill you! Iâ€™ll kill the lot of you!â€™ Why not,
939987 [34163] why could it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter â€˜fatalâ€™
939987 [34164] rather than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because a
939987 [34165] witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his
939987 [34166] hand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was
939987 [34167] done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not â€˜absurd,â€™ but
939987 [34168] â€˜fatal.â€™
939987 [34169] 
939987 [34170] â€œNow, thank God! weâ€™ve come to the real point: â€˜since he was in the
939987 [34171] garden, he must have murdered him.â€™ In those few words: â€˜since he _was_,
939987 [34172] then he _must_â€™ lies the whole case for the prosecution. He was there, so
939987 [34173] he must have. And what if there is no _must_ about it, even if he was
939987 [34174] there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidenceâ€”the coincidencesâ€”are really
939987 [34175] suggestive. But examine all these facts separately, regardless of their
939987 [34176] connection. Why, for instance, does the prosecution refuse to admit the
939987 [34177] truth of the prisonerâ€™s statement that he ran away from his fatherâ€™s
939987 [34178] window? Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the
939987 [34179] expense of the respectful and â€˜piousâ€™ sentiments which suddenly came over
939987 [34180] the murderer. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of
939987 [34181] religious awe, if not of filial respect? â€˜My mother must have been praying
939987 [34182] for me at that moment,â€™ were the prisonerâ€™s words at the preliminary
939987 [34183] inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced himself that Madame
939987 [34184] Svyetlov was not in his fatherâ€™s house. â€˜But he could not convince himself
939987 [34185] by looking through the window,â€™ the prosecutor objects. But why couldnâ€™t
939987 [34186] he? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word
939987 [34187] might have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which
939987 [34188] showed the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume
939987 [34189] everything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A
939987 [34190] thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest
939987 [34191] imagination.
939987 [34192] 
939987 [34193] â€œ â€˜Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly was in
939987 [34194] the house, therefore he killed him.â€™ Now about that door, gentlemen of the
939987 [34195] jury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that
939987 [34196] door, and he was at the time in such a condition, thatâ€” But supposing the
939987 [34197] door was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an
939987 [34198] instinct of self-defense, natural in his position; supposing he did go
939987 [34199] into the houseâ€”well, what then? How does it follow that because he was
939987 [34200] there he committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the
939987 [34201] rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him; but as
939987 [34202] soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he may have run
939987 [34203] away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed his
939987 [34204] father. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptation
939987 [34205] to kill his father, because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at
939987 [34206] not having killed him, that he was capable of a pure feeling, the feeling
939987 [34207] of pity and compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to the
939987 [34208] assistance of Grigory after he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.
939987 [34209] 
939987 [34210] â€œWith terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful
939987 [34211] state of the prisonerâ€™s mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him
939987 [34212] calling him to new life, while love was impossible for him because he had
939987 [34213] his fatherâ€™s bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that
939987 [34214] corpseâ€”retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him love, which he
939987 [34215] explained, according to his method, talking about his drunken condition,
939987 [34216] about a criminal being taken to execution, about it being still far off,
939987 [34217] and so on and so on. But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not
939987 [34218] invented a new personality? Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to
939987 [34219] be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape
939987 [34220] punishment, if his hands were really stained with his fatherâ€™s blood? No,
939987 [34221] no, no! As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called
939987 [34222] him to her side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must
939987 [34223] have felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed
939987 [34224] himself, if he had his fatherâ€™s murder on his conscience. Oh, no! he would
939987 [34225] not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the prisoner: the savage,
939987 [34226] stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with
939987 [34227] his character. He would have killed himself, thatâ€™s certain. He did not
939987 [34228] kill himself just because â€˜his motherâ€™s prayers had saved him,â€™ and he was
939987 [34229] innocent of his fatherâ€™s blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that
939987 [34230] night at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man
939987 [34231] would recover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not
939987 [34232] have to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?
939987 [34233] What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?
939987 [34234] 
939987 [34235] â€œBut we shall be told at once again, â€˜There is his fatherâ€™s corpse! If he
939987 [34236] ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?â€™ Here, I repeat, you
939987 [34237] have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he?
939987 [34238] Thereâ€™s no one to put in his place.
939987 [34239] 
939987 [34240] â€œGentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually true
939987 [34241] that there is no one else at all? Weâ€™ve heard the prosecutor count on his
939987 [34242] fingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were five
939987 [34243] in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsibleâ€”the
939987 [34244] murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the
939987 [34245] prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the
939987 [34246] prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, that
939987 [34247] had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would
939987 [34248] have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have
939987 [34249] accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the
939987 [34250] very opposite conclusion? There are two personsâ€”the prisoner and
939987 [34251] Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because
939987 [34252] you have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you
939987 [34253] have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.
939987 [34254] 
939987 [34255] â€œItâ€™s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two
939987 [34256] brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him: there
939987 [34257] are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a
939987 [34258] feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of
939987 [34259] facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first place
939987 [34260] we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the
939987 [34261] genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to
939987 [34262] make a careful defense. Then Smerdyakovâ€™s sudden suicide on the eve of the
939987 [34263] trial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the
939987 [34264] elder of the prisonerâ€™s brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has
939987 [34265] to-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the
939987 [34266] murderer. Oh, I fully share the courtâ€™s and the prosecutorâ€™s conviction
939987 [34267] that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement may
939987 [34268] really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother by
939987 [34269] throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again Smerdyakovâ€™s name is
939987 [34270] pronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery. There is something
939987 [34271] unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we
939987 [34272] wonâ€™t go into that now. Of that later.
939987 [34273] 
939987 [34274] â€œThe court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might
939987 [34275] make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with
939987 [34276] subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent I
939987 [34277] cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him and
939987 [34278] talked to him, and he made a very different impression on me. He was weak
939987 [34279] in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the
939987 [34280] weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of
939987 [34281] the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity
939987 [34282] about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme
939987 [34283] mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _naÃ¯vetÃ©_, and an intelligence
939987 [34284] of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for
939987 [34285] weak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the
939987 [34286] conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively
939987 [34287] ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he
939987 [34288] resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when
939987 [34289] he remembered that he was the son of â€˜stinking Lizaveta.â€™ He was
939987 [34290] disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him
939987 [34291] in his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to
939987 [34292] France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadnâ€™t the
939987 [34293] means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely
939987 [34294] high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good
939987 [34295] clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be
939987 [34296] the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he
939987 [34297] might well have resented his position, compared with that of his masterâ€™s
939987 [34298] legitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights,
939987 [34299] they had the inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himself
939987 [34300] that he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The
939987 [34301] destination of that sumâ€”a sum which would have made his careerâ€”must have
939987 [34302] been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in new
939987 [34303] rainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.) Oh, beware of
939987 [34304] showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once! And it
939987 [34305] was the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man. The
939987 [34306] sight of the rainbow-colored notes may have made a morbid impression on
939987 [34307] his imagination, but with no immediate results.
939987 [34308] 
939987 [34309] â€œThe talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us all
939987 [34310] the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakovâ€™s guilt, and
939987 [34311] asked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit. But he may
939987 [34312] not have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite naturally,
939987 [34313] but it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man may have
939987 [34314] recovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as
939987 [34315] happens with epileptics.
939987 [34316] 
939987 [34317] â€œThe prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the
939987 [34318] murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment. He might have waked
939987 [34319] up from deep sleep (for he was only asleepâ€”an epileptic fit is always
939987 [34320] followed by a deep sleep) at that moment when the old Grigory shouted at
939987 [34321] the top of his voice â€˜Parricide!â€™ That shout in the dark and stillness may
939987 [34322] have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment:
939987 [34323] he might naturally have waked up an hour before.
939987 [34324] 
939987 [34325] â€œGetting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite
939987 [34326] motive towards the sound to see whatâ€™s the matter. His head is still
939987 [34327] clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in the
939987 [34328] garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from
939987 [34329] his master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind sets to
939987 [34330] work at once. He hears all the details from his frightened master, and
939987 [34331] gradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an ideaâ€”terrible,
939987 [34332] but seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take the
939987 [34333] three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A terrible
939987 [34334] lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security
939987 [34335] from detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often
939987 [34336] when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers who
939987 [34337] have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov may
939987 [34338] have gone in and carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with any
939987 [34339] stone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the
939987 [34340] three thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting
939987 [34341] myselfâ€”the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where
939987 [34342] to find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the moneyâ€”the
939987 [34343] torn envelope on the floor?
939987 [34344] 
939987 [34345] â€œJust now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only
939987 [34346] an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the
939987 [34347] floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a piece
939987 [34348] of evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearing
939987 [34349] something very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that very
939987 [34350] argument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved,
939987 [34351] precisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself. Whatâ€™s more, it struck
939987 [34352] me at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about
939987 [34353] him; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
939987 [34354] it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same
939987 [34355] idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?
939987 [34356] 
939987 [34357] â€œI shall be asked, â€˜What about the old woman, Grigoryâ€™s wife? She heard
939987 [34358] the sick man moaning close by, all night.â€™ Yes, she heard it, but that
939987 [34359] evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly
939987 [34360] that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the poor
939987 [34361] beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And thatâ€™s
939987 [34362] natural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at
939987 [34363] being waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a
939987 [34364] groan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two
939987 [34365] hours laterâ€”three times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeper
939987 [34366] wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and
939987 [34367] keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of two
939987 [34368] hours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments of
939987 [34369] waking, so he feels he has been waked up all night.
939987 [34370] 
939987 [34371] â€œBut why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his last
939987 [34372] letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both?
939987 [34373] But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not have
939987 [34374] felt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are two very
939987 [34375] different things. Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable, and the
939987 [34376] suicide, laying his hands on himself, may well have felt redoubled hatred
939987 [34377] for those whom he had envied all his life.
939987 [34378] 
939987 [34379] â€œGentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is there
939987 [34380] unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the error in my
939987 [34381] reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And if there is but a
939987 [34382] shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my propositions, do
939987 [34383] not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I swear by all that is sacred,
939987 [34384] I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward.
939987 [34385] What troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts
939987 [34386] heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a single
939987 [34387] one certain and irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by
939987 [34388] the accumulation of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the
939987 [34389] blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt, the
939987 [34390] dark night resounding with the shout â€˜Parricide!â€™ and the old man falling
939987 [34391] with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures,
939987 [34392] shouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but,
939987 [34393] gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds? Remember, you have been
939987 [34394] given absolute power to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the
939987 [34395] more terrible its responsibility.
939987 [34396] 
939987 [34397] â€œI do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but suppose
939987 [34398] for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had
939987 [34399] stained his hands with his fatherâ€™s blood. This is only hypothesis, I
939987 [34400] repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence. But, so be it, I
939987 [34401] assume that my client is guilty of parricide. Even so, hear what I have to
939987 [34402] say. I have it in my heart to say something more to you, for I feel that
939987 [34403] there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my
939987 [34404] referring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to
939987 [34405] be truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!â€
939987 [34406] 
939987 [34407] At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. The last
939987 [34408] words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that every
939987 [34409] one felt that he really might have something to say, and that what he was
939987 [34410] about to say would be of the greatest consequence. But the President,
939987 [34411] hearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if
939987 [34412] such an incident were repeated. Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch
939987 [34413] began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used
939987 [34414] hitherto.
939987 [34415] 
939987 [34416] 
939987 [34417] 
939987 [34418] Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought
939987 [34419] 
939987 [34420] 
939987 [34421] â€œItâ€™s not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with
939987 [34422] ruin, gentlemen of the jury,â€ he began, â€œwhat is really damning for my
939987 [34423] client is one factâ€”the dead body of his father. Had it been an ordinary
939987 [34424] case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the
939987 [34425] triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of the
939987 [34426] evidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, you
939987 [34427] would have hesitated to ruin a manâ€™s life simply from the prejudice
939987 [34428] against him which he has, alas! only too well deserved. But itâ€™s not an
939987 [34429] ordinary case of murder, itâ€™s a case of parricide. That impresses menâ€™s
939987 [34430] minds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of
939987 [34431] the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an
939987 [34432] unprejudiced mind. How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he
939987 [34433] committed the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one,
939987 [34434] almost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.
939987 [34435] 
939987 [34436] â€œYes, itâ€™s a fearful thing to shed a fatherâ€™s bloodâ€”the father who has
939987 [34437] begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over my
939987 [34438] illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness, and
939987 [34439] has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a fatherâ€”thatâ€™s
939987 [34440] inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a fatherâ€”a real father? What
939987 [34441] is the meaning of that great word? What is the great idea in that name? We
939987 [34442] have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be.
939987 [34443] In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our
939987 [34444] hearts are achingâ€”in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
939987 [34445] Karamazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we
939987 [34446] have just referred. Thatâ€™s the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are a
939987 [34447] misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we must
939987 [34448] shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the importance of
939987 [34449] the decision you have to make. Itâ€™s our particular duty not to shrink from
939987 [34450] any idea, like children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutor
939987 [34451] happily expresses it.
939987 [34452] 
939987 [34453] â€œBut in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent (and he was
939987 [34454] my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several times, â€˜Oh, I will
939987 [34455] not yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from
939987 [34456] Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend also!â€™ He exclaimed that several times,
939987 [34457] but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three
939987 [34458] years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who
939987 [34459] had been kind to him, as a child in his fatherâ€™s house, might not such a
939987 [34460] man well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his fatherâ€™s
939987 [34461] back-yard, â€˜without boots on his feet and with his little trousers hanging
939987 [34462] by one buttonâ€™â€”to use the expression of the kind-hearted doctor,
939987 [34463] Herzenstube?
939987 [34464] 
939987 [34465] â€œOh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at this
939987 [34466] misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my client meet
939987 [34467] with when he arrived here, at his fatherâ€™s house, and why depict my client
939987 [34468] as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he is wild and
939987 [34469] unrulyâ€”we are trying him now for thatâ€”but who is responsible for his life?
939987 [34470] Who is responsible for his having received such an unseemly bringing up,
939987 [34471] in spite of his excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitive
939987 [34472] heart? Did any one train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by
939987 [34473] study? Did any one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was
939987 [34474] left to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted
939987 [34475] perhaps to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand times
939987 [34476] perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away the loathsome
939987 [34477] phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he may
939987 [34478] have longed to embrace and to forgive his father! And what awaited him? He
939987 [34479] was met by cynical taunts, suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard
939987 [34480] nothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the
939987 [34481] brandy, and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with
939987 [34482] his own money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
939987 [34483] And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of
939987 [34484] his son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated him, bought
939987 [34485] up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison.
939987 [34486] 
939987 [34487] â€œGentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly, and
939987 [34488] uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed,
939987 [34489] exceedingly tender-hearted, only they donâ€™t express it. Donâ€™t laugh, donâ€™t
939987 [34490] laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at
939987 [34491] my client for loving Schillerâ€”loving the sublime and beautiful! I should
939987 [34492] not have laughed at that in his place. Yes, such naturesâ€”oh, let me speak
939987 [34493] in defense of such natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstoodâ€”these
939987 [34494] natures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in
939987 [34495] contrast to themselves, their unruliness, their ferocityâ€”they thirst for
939987 [34496] it unconsciously. Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully
939987 [34497] capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated
939987 [34498] love. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in such
939987 [34499] natures. But they cannot hide their passionsâ€”sometimes very coarseâ€”and
939987 [34500] that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Their
939987 [34501] passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and lofty
939987 [34502] creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks to
939987 [34503] correct himself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, â€˜sublime and
939987 [34504] beautiful,â€™ however much the expression has been ridiculed.
939987 [34505] 
939987 [34506] â€œI said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my clientâ€™s
939987 [34507] engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just now was not
939987 [34508] evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and it
939987 [34509] was not for herâ€”oh, not for her!â€”to reproach him with treachery, for she
939987 [34510] has betrayed him! If she had had but a little time for reflection she
939987 [34511] would not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client
939987 [34512] is not a monster, as she called him!
939987 [34513] 
939987 [34514] â€œThe Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: â€˜I am the Good
939987 [34515] Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, so that not
939987 [34516] one of them might be lost.â€™ Let not a manâ€™s soul be lost through us!
939987 [34517] 
939987 [34518] â€œI asked just now what does â€˜fatherâ€™ mean, and exclaimed that it was a
939987 [34519] great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly, gentlemen,
939987 [34520] and I venture to call things by their right names: such a father as old
939987 [34521] Karamazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve to be. Filial
939987 [34522] love for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an impossibility. Love cannot
939987 [34523] be created from nothing: only God can create something from nothing.
939987 [34524] 
939987 [34525] â€œ â€˜Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,â€™ the apostle writes, from
939987 [34526] a heart glowing with love. Itâ€™s not for the sake of my client that I quote
939987 [34527] these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has authorized me
939987 [34528] to preach to fathers? No one. But as a man and a citizen I make my
939987 [34529] appealâ€”_vivos voco!_ We are not long on earth, we do many evil deeds and
939987 [34530] say many evil words. So let us all catch a favorable moment when we are
939987 [34531] all together to say a good word to each other. Thatâ€™s what I am doing:
939987 [34532] while I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for
939987 [34533] nothing is this tribune given us by the highest authorityâ€”all Russia hears
939987 [34534] us! I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud to
939987 [34535] all fathers: â€˜Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.â€™ Yes, let us
939987 [34536] first fulfill Christâ€™s injunction ourselves and only then venture to
939987 [34537] expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of
939987 [34538] our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have
939987 [34539] made them our enemies ourselves. â€˜What measure ye mete it shall be
939987 [34540] measured unto you againâ€™â€”itâ€™s not I who say that, itâ€™s the Gospel precept,
939987 [34541] measure to others according as they measure to you. How can we blame
939987 [34542] children if they measure us according to our measure?
939987 [34543] 
939987 [34544] â€œNot long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretly
939987 [34545] given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no one knew
939987 [34546] anything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks. It was
939987 [34547] opened and inside was found the body of a new-born child which she had
939987 [34548] killed. In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies
939987 [34549] which, according to her own confession, she had killed at the moment of
939987 [34550] their birth.
939987 [34551] 
939987 [34552] â€œGentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave birth
939987 [34553] to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would any one venture to
939987 [34554] give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be bold, gentlemen, let us be
939987 [34555] audacious even: itâ€™s our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid
939987 [34556] of certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovskyâ€™s play, who
939987 [34557] are scared at the sound of certain words. No, let us prove that the
939987 [34558] progress of the last few years has touched even us, and let us say
939987 [34559] plainly, the father is not merely he who begets the child, but he who
939987 [34560] begets it and does his duty by it.
939987 [34561] 
939987 [34562] â€œOh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other
939987 [34563] interpretation of the word â€˜father,â€™ which insists that any father, even
939987 [34564] though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children, still
939987 [34565] remains my father simply because he begot me. But this is, so to say, the
939987 [34566] mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my intellect, but can only
939987 [34567] accept by faith, or, better to say, _on faith_, like many other things
939987 [34568] which I do not understand, but which religion bids me believe. But in that
939987 [34569] case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of
939987 [34570] actual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us
939987 [34571] great duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be
939987 [34572] humaneâ€”Christian, in factâ€”we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions
939987 [34573] justified by reason and experience, which have been passed through the
939987 [34574] crucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though
939987 [34575] in dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill-treat
939987 [34576] and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, but
939987 [34577] rational and philanthropic....â€
939987 [34578] 
939987 [34579] There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court,
939987 [34580] but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him
939987 [34581] finish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at once. The
939987 [34582] orator went on.
939987 [34583] 
939987 [34584] â€œDo you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin to
939987 [34585] reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not impose
939987 [34586] on them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy father
939987 [34587] involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature,
939987 [34588] especially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his
939987 [34589] companions. The conventional answer to this question is: â€˜He begot you,
939987 [34590] and you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.â€™
939987 [34591] The youth involuntarily reflects: â€˜But did he love me when he begot me?â€™
939987 [34592] he asks, wondering more and more. â€˜Was it for my sake he begot me? He did
939987 [34593] not know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,
939987 [34594] perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensity
939987 [34595] to drunkennessâ€”thatâ€™s all heâ€™s done for me.... Why am I bound to love him
939987 [34596] simply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my life
939987 [34597] after?â€™
939987 [34598] 
939987 [34599] â€œOh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do not
939987 [34600] expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. â€˜Drive nature out of the
939987 [34601] door and it will fly in at the window,â€™ and, above all, let us not be
939987 [34602] afraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates of
939987 [34603] reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas. How shall it be decided? Why,
939987 [34604] like this. Let the son stand before his father and ask him, â€˜Father, tell
939987 [34605] me, why must I love you? Father, show me that I must love you,â€™ and if
939987 [34606] that father is able to answer him and show him good reason, we have a
939987 [34607] real, normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on
939987 [34608] a rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does
939987 [34609] not, thereâ€™s an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him, and the
939987 [34610] son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even an enemy. Our
939987 [34611] tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a school of true and sound
939987 [34612] ideas.â€
939987 [34613] 
939987 [34614] (Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic
939987 [34615] applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of it
939987 [34616] applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded. Shrieks and
939987 [34617] exclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were sitting.
939987 [34618] Handkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his bell with all
939987 [34619] his might. He was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience, but
939987 [34620] did not venture to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of
939987 [34621] high position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially
939987 [34622] reserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their
939987 [34623] handkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down, the President confined
939987 [34624] himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and
939987 [34625] Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)
939987 [34626] 
939987 [34627] â€œGentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much has
939987 [34628] been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to face
939987 [34629] with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist most
939987 [34630] emphatically it was not for money he ran to his fatherâ€™s house: the charge
939987 [34631] of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not to murder
939987 [34632] him he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that design he would,
939987 [34633] at least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The
939987 [34634] brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it.
939987 [34635] Granted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that
939987 [34636] he made his way inâ€”Iâ€™ve said already that I do not for a moment believe
939987 [34637] that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment. Gentlemen,
939987 [34638] I swear to you by all thatâ€™s holy, if it had not been his father, but an
939987 [34639] ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfying
939987 [34640] himself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, without
939987 [34641] doing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him away
939987 [34642] perhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare for
939987 [34643] that. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, his
939987 [34644] father! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood,
939987 [34645] had been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was
939987 [34646] enough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly,
939987 [34647] clouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of
939987 [34648] madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and
939987 [34649] unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its
939987 [34650] eternal laws.
939987 [34651] 
939987 [34652] â€œBut the prisoner even then did not murder himâ€”I maintain that, I cry that
939987 [34653] aloud!â€”no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust,
939987 [34654] not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he not
939987 [34655] had this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his father
939987 [34656] down perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did not
939987 [34657] know whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder.
939987 [34658] Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot
939987 [34659] be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by
939987 [34660] prejudice.
939987 [34661] 
939987 [34662] â€œBut I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this
939987 [34663] murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and
939987 [34664] punish him, he will say to himself: â€˜These people have done nothing for my
939987 [34665] bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make
939987 [34666] me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat
939987 [34667] and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they
939987 [34668] have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and
939987 [34669] owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They
939987 [34670] are cruel and I will be cruel.â€™ That is what he will say, gentlemen of the
939987 [34671] jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for
939987 [34672] him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and
939987 [34673] will not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him the
939987 [34674] possibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickedness
939987 [34675] and blindness all his life.
939987 [34676] 
939987 [34677] â€œBut do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful
939987 [34678] punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and
939987 [34679] regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see,
939987 [34680] you will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck. â€˜How can I endure
939987 [34681] this mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?â€™ Thatâ€™s what
939987 [34682] he will exclaim.
939987 [34683] 
939987 [34684] â€œOh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen of
939987 [34685] the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and loving
939987 [34686] action, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in their
939987 [34687] limitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with mercy, show
939987 [34688] it love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses in
939987 [34689] it. Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are
939987 [34690] good and just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse
939987 [34691] and the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say
939987 [34692] then, â€˜I am quits,â€™ but will say, â€˜I am guilty in the sight of all men and
939987 [34693] am more unworthy than all.â€™ With tears of penitence and poignant, tender
939987 [34694] anguish, he will exclaim: â€˜Others are better than I, they wanted to save
939987 [34695] me, not to ruin me!â€™ Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the
939987 [34696] absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to
939987 [34697] pronounce: â€˜Yes, he is guilty.â€™
939987 [34698] 
939987 [34699] â€œBetter acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear,
939987 [34700] do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious
939987 [34701] history? It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that
939987 [34702] the Russian court does not exist for the punishment only, but also for the
939987 [34703] salvation of the criminal! Let other nations think of retribution and the
939987 [34704] letter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaningâ€”the
939987 [34705] salvation and the reformation of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and
939987 [34706] her justice are such, she may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to
939987 [34707] scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside
939987 [34708] in disgust. Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will
939987 [34709] move calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my
939987 [34710] client, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend it,
939987 [34711] you will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch over it, that
939987 [34712] it is in good hands!â€
939987 [34713] 
939987 [34714] 
939987 [34715] 
939987 [34716] Chapter XIV. The Peasants Stand Firm
939987 [34717] 
939987 [34718] 
939987 [34719] This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of the
939987 [34720] audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the question to
939987 [34721] stop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important
939987 [34722] personages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringing
939987 [34723] his bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression
939987 [34724] of something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself
939987 [34725] was genuinely touched.
939987 [34726] 
939987 [34727] And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain
939987 [34728] objections. People looked at him with hatred. â€œWhat? Whatâ€™s the meaning of
939987 [34729] it? He positively dares to make objections,â€ the ladies babbled. But if
939987 [34730] the whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could not
939987 [34731] have been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking with
939987 [34732] emotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,
939987 [34733] could hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered
939987 [34734] himself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.
939987 [34735] 
939987 [34736] â€œ... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defense
939987 [34737] if not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.
939987 [34738] Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelope
939987 [34739] and throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged in
939987 [34740] this strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we
939987 [34741] that he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded
939987 [34742] idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for
939987 [34743] his illegitimate birthâ€”isnâ€™t this a romance in the Byronic style? And the
939987 [34744] son who breaks into his fatherâ€™s house and murders him without murdering
939987 [34745] him is not even a romanceâ€”this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he
939987 [34746] cannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and whatâ€™s the
939987 [34747] meaning of his murdering him without having murdered himâ€”who can make head
939987 [34748] or tail of this?
939987 [34749] 
939987 [34750] â€œThen we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound
939987 [34751] ideas and from this tribune of â€˜sound ideasâ€™ is heard a solemn declaration
939987 [34752] that to call the murder of a father â€˜parricideâ€™ is nothing but a
939987 [34753] prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask
939987 [34754] his father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will become
939987 [34755] of the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,
939987 [34756] it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchantsâ€™ wives. The most precious,
939987 [34757] the most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice
939987 [34758] are presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an
939987 [34759] objectâ€”to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.
939987 [34760] â€˜Oh, crush him by mercy,â€™ cries the counsel for the defense; but thatâ€™s
939987 [34761] all the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is
939987 [34762] crushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only
939987 [34763] for the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of
939987 [34764] the parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?
939987 [34765] Religion and the Gospel are correctedâ€”thatâ€™s all mysticism, we are told,
939987 [34766] and ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the
939987 [34767] analysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false
939987 [34768] semblance of Christ! â€˜What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you
939987 [34769] again,â€™ cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that
939987 [34770] Christ teaches us to measure as it is measured to usâ€”and this from the
939987 [34771] tribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve
939987 [34772] of making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance
939987 [34773] with what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use
939987 [34774] to produce a certain effectâ€”all to serve the purpose! But what Christ
939987 [34775] commands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,
939987 [34776] because the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn
939987 [34777] the other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to
939987 [34778] us. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to
939987 [34779] murder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of
939987 [34780] truth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for
939987 [34781] the defense deigns to call only â€˜the crucified lover of humanity,â€™ in
939987 [34782] opposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, â€˜For Thou art our
939987 [34783] God!â€™ â€
939987 [34784] 
939987 [34785] At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,
939987 [34786] begging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as
939987 [34787] presidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. The
939987 [34788] public was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.
939987 [34789] Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to lay
939987 [34790] his hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full
939987 [34791] of dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on â€œromancingâ€
939987 [34792] and â€œpsychology,â€ and in an appropriate place quoted, â€œJupiter, you are
939987 [34793] angry, therefore you are wrong,â€ which provoked a burst of approving
939987 [34794] laughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like
939987 [34795] Jupiter. Then, _Ã  propos_ of the accusation that he was teaching the young
939987 [34796] generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with great
939987 [34797] dignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutorâ€™s charge of
939987 [34798] uttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal
939987 [34799] insinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from
939987 [34800] accusations â€œdamaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.â€
939987 [34801] But at these words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch
939987 [34802] concluded his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.
939987 [34803] And Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, â€œcrushed for
939987 [34804] good.â€
939987 [34805] 
939987 [34806] Then the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said very
939987 [34807] little. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look of
939987 [34808] strength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had
939987 [34809] almost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through an
939987 [34810] experience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life
939987 [34811] something very important he had not understood till then. His voice was
939987 [34812] weak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of
939987 [34813] humility, defeat and submission.
939987 [34814] 
939987 [34815] â€œWhat am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come
939987 [34816] for me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring man!
939987 [34817] But, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my fatherâ€™s blood! For
939987 [34818] the last time I repeat, it wasnâ€™t I killed him! I was erring, but I loved
939987 [34819] what is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild
939987 [34820] beast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I
939987 [34821] did not know; but itâ€™s not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is
939987 [34822] mistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but itâ€™s not
939987 [34823] true that I killed my father, and he neednâ€™t have supposed it. And donâ€™t
939987 [34824] believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you
939987 [34825] spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. I
939987 [34826] give you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, Iâ€™ll break
939987 [34827] my sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob
939987 [34828] me of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen
939987 [34829] ... spare me!â€
939987 [34830] 
939987 [34831] He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly
939987 [34832] articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions
939987 [34833] and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.
939987 [34834] 
939987 [34835] But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for
939987 [34836] consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the
939987 [34837] jury was rather feeble. â€œBe impartial, donâ€™t be influenced by the
939987 [34838] eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there
939987 [34839] is a great responsibility laid upon you,â€ and so on and so on.
939987 [34840] 
939987 [34841] The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move
939987 [34842] about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the
939987 [34843] buffet. It was very late, almost one oâ€™clock in the night, but nobody went
939987 [34844] away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All
939987 [34845] waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for
939987 [34846] the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts
939987 [34847] were untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all
939987 [34848] prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must
939987 [34849] own there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an
939987 [34850] acquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while some
939987 [34851] were simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch
939987 [34852] himself was confident of his success. He was surrounded by people
939987 [34853] congratulating him and fawning upon him.
939987 [34854] 
939987 [34855] â€œThere are,â€ he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, â€œthere are
939987 [34856] invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury. One
939987 [34857] feels during oneâ€™s speech if they are being formed. I was aware of them.
939987 [34858] They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.â€
939987 [34859] 
939987 [34860] â€œWhat will our peasants say now?â€ said one stout, cross-looking,
939987 [34861] pock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a
939987 [34862] group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.
939987 [34863] 
939987 [34864] â€œBut they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks among
939987 [34865] them.â€
939987 [34866] 
939987 [34867] â€œYes, there are clerks,â€ said a member of the district council, joining
939987 [34868] the group.
939987 [34869] 
939987 [34870] â€œAnd do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?â€
939987 [34871] 
939987 [34872] â€œWhat of him?â€
939987 [34873] 
939987 [34874] â€œHe is a man with brains.â€
939987 [34875] 
939987 [34876] â€œBut he never speaks.â€
939987 [34877] 
939987 [34878] â€œHe is no great talker, but so much the better. Thereâ€™s no need for the
939987 [34879] Petersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself. Heâ€™s
939987 [34880] the father of twelve children. Think of that!â€
939987 [34881] 
939987 [34882] â€œUpon my word, you donâ€™t suppose they wonâ€™t acquit him?â€ one of our young
939987 [34883] officials exclaimed in another group.
939987 [34884] 
939987 [34885] â€œTheyâ€™ll acquit him for certain,â€ said a resolute voice.
939987 [34886] 
939987 [34887] â€œIt would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!â€ cried the
939987 [34888] official. â€œSuppose he did murder himâ€”there are fathers and fathers! And,
939987 [34889] besides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done nothing but
939987 [34890] swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down. But it was a
939987 [34891] pity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! If Iâ€™d
939987 [34892] been in Fetyukovitchâ€™s place, I should simply have said straight out: â€˜He
939987 [34893] murdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it all!â€™ â€
939987 [34894] 
939987 [34895] â€œThatâ€™s what he did, only without saying, â€˜Hang it all!â€™ â€
939987 [34896] 
939987 [34897] â€œNo, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,â€ put in a third voice.
939987 [34898] 
939987 [34899] â€œWhy, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut
939987 [34900] the throat of her loverâ€™s lawful wife.â€
939987 [34901] 
939987 [34902] â€œOh, but she did not finish cutting it.â€
939987 [34903] 
939987 [34904] â€œThat makes no difference. She began cutting it.â€
939987 [34905] 
939987 [34906] â€œWhat did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasnâ€™t it?â€
939987 [34907] 
939987 [34908] â€œSplendid!â€
939987 [34909] 
939987 [34910] â€œAnd about mysticism, too!â€
939987 [34911] 
939987 [34912] â€œOh, drop mysticism, do!â€ cried some one else; â€œthink of Ippolit and his
939987 [34913] fate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow for
939987 [34914] Mityaâ€™s sake.â€
939987 [34915] 
939987 [34916] â€œIs she here?â€
939987 [34917] 
939987 [34918] â€œWhat an idea! If sheâ€™d been here sheâ€™d have scratched them out in court.
939987 [34919] She is at home with toothache. He he he!â€
939987 [34920] 
939987 [34921] â€œHe he he!â€
939987 [34922] 
939987 [34923] In a third group:
939987 [34924] 
939987 [34925] â€œI dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.â€
939987 [34926] 
939987 [34927] â€œI should not be surprised if he turns the â€˜Metropolisâ€™ upside down
939987 [34928] to-morrow. He will be drinking for ten days!â€
939987 [34929] 
939987 [34930] â€œOh, the devil!â€
939987 [34931] 
939987 [34932] â€œThe devilâ€™s bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not here?â€
939987 [34933] 
939987 [34934] â€œWell, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still itâ€™s not the thing to
939987 [34935] break your fatherâ€™s head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?â€
939987 [34936] 
939987 [34937] â€œThe chariot! Do you remember the chariot?â€
939987 [34938] 
939987 [34939] â€œYes; he turned a cart into a chariot!â€
939987 [34940] 
939987 [34941] â€œAnd to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his
939987 [34942] purpose.â€
939987 [34943] 
939987 [34944] â€œWhat cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had in
939987 [34945] Russia?â€
939987 [34946] 
939987 [34947] But the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither more
939987 [34948] nor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public
939987 [34949] had taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.
939987 [34950] At last! I wonâ€™t repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I have
939987 [34951] forgotten them. I remember only the answer to the Presidentâ€™s first and
939987 [34952] chief question: â€œDid the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of
939987 [34953] robbery and with premeditation?â€ (I donâ€™t remember the exact words.) There
939987 [34954] was a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,
939987 [34955] pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of the
939987 [34956] court:
939987 [34957] 
939987 [34958] â€œYes, guilty!â€
939987 [34959] 
939987 [34960] And the same answer was repeated to every question: â€œYes, guilty!â€ and
939987 [34961] without the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;
939987 [34962] almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.
939987 [34963] The deathlike silence in the court was not brokenâ€”all seemed petrified:
939987 [34964] those who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager for
939987 [34965] his acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was
939987 [34966] followed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were
939987 [34967] pleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their
939987 [34968] joy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their
939987 [34969] shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But how
939987 [34970] shall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they would create
939987 [34971] a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly the
939987 [34972] whole court rang with exclamations: â€œWhatâ€™s the meaning of it? What next?â€
939987 [34973] They leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at
939987 [34974] once reconsidered and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up
939987 [34975] and cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before him:
939987 [34976] 
939987 [34977] â€œI swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of my
939987 [34978] fatherâ€™s blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on the
939987 [34979] other woman!â€
939987 [34980] 
939987 [34981] He could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard
939987 [34982] all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own. From the
939987 [34983] farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriekâ€”it was
939987 [34984] Grushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again
939987 [34985] before the beginning of the lawyersâ€™ speeches. Mitya was taken away. The
939987 [34986] passing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was in
939987 [34987] a hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I
939987 [34988] heard on the steps as I went out.
939987 [34989] 
939987 [34990] â€œHeâ€™ll have a twenty yearsâ€™ trip to the mines!â€
939987 [34991] 
939987 [34992] â€œNot less.â€
939987 [34993] 
939987 [34994] â€œWell, our peasants have stood firm.â€
939987 [34995] 
939987 [34996] â€œAnd have done for our Mitya.â€
939987 [34997]

939987 [35007] Chapter I. Plans For Mityaâ€™s Escape
939987 [35008] 
939987 [35009] 
939987 [35010] Very early, at nine oâ€™clock in the morning, five days after the trial,
939987 [35011] Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovnaâ€™s to talk over a matter of great
939987 [35012] importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked
939987 [35013] to him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the
939987 [35014] next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina
939987 [35015] Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and
939987 [35016] unconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable
939987 [35017] gossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who
939987 [35018] lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in
939987 [35019] court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [35020] would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the
939987 [35021] sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were
939987 [35022] attending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give
939987 [35023] an opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors
939987 [35024] encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could
939987 [35025] not yet give them positive hopes of recovery.
939987 [35026] 
939987 [35027] Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time he had
939987 [35028] specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to
939987 [35029] approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement
939987 [35030] that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of
939987 [35031] haste.
939987 [35032] 
939987 [35033] They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale
939987 [35034] and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical
939987 [35035] excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to
939987 [35036] her.
939987 [35037] 
939987 [35038] â€œDonâ€™t worry about his decision,â€ she said, with confident emphasis to
939987 [35039] Alyosha. â€œOne way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape.
939987 [35040] That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principleâ€”not he, not Dmitri
939987 [35041] Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has
939987 [35042] sacrificed himself for his brother,â€ Katya added, with flashing eyesâ€”â€œtold
939987 [35043] me the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into
939987 [35044] negotiations.... Iâ€™ve told you something already.... You see, it will
939987 [35045] probably come off at the third _Ã©tape_ from here, when the party of
939987 [35046] prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, itâ€™s a long way off yet. Ivan
939987 [35047] Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _Ã©tape_.
939987 [35048] But we donâ€™t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and itâ€™s
939987 [35049] impossible to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I will
939987 [35050] show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the
939987 [35051] eve of the trial in case of need.... That was whenâ€”do you remember?â€”you
939987 [35052] found us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs, but seeing you I made
939987 [35053] him come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling about
939987 [35054] then?â€
939987 [35055] 
939987 [35056] â€œNo, I donâ€™t,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [35057] 
939987 [35058] â€œOf course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had
939987 [35059] told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it
939987 [35060] at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told
939987 [35061] me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with
939987 [35062] that creature, I felt furious at onceâ€”I canâ€™t tell you why, I donâ€™t know
939987 [35063] myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and
939987 [35064] that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!â€ Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed
939987 [35065] suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. â€œAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw
939987 [35066] that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous
939987 [35067] of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel
939987 [35068] began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I
939987 [35069] could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving
939987 [35070] that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love
939987 [35071] Dmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that
939987 [35072] creature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you
939987 [35073] came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if
939987 [35074] anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the
939987 [35075] envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or was
939987 [35076] taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then he left me money,
939987 [35077] nearly ten thousandâ€”those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his
939987 [35078] speech, having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be changed. I
939987 [35079] was tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up
939987 [35080] his idea of saving his brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to
939987 [35081] me, though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved
939987 [35082] Mitya. Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness
939987 [35083] of such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his feet
939987 [35084] in reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only for my joy
939987 [35085] at the thought of Mityaâ€™s being saved (and he certainly would have
939987 [35086] imagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere possibility of such
939987 [35087] an unjust thought on his part that I lost my temper again, and instead of
939987 [35088] kissing his feet, flew into a fury again! Oh, I am unhappy! Itâ€™s my
939987 [35089] character, my awful, unhappy character! Oh, you will see, I shall end by
939987 [35090] driving him, too, to abandon me for another with whom he can get on
939987 [35091] better, like Dmitri. But ... no, I could not bear it, I should kill
939987 [35092] myself. And when you came in then, and when I called to you and told him
939987 [35093] to come back, I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he
939987 [35094] turned on me thatâ€”do you remember?â€”I cried out to you that it was he, he
939987 [35095] alone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I said
939987 [35096] that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again. He had never, never
939987 [35097] persuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I
939987 [35098] who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved
939987 [35099] the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he
939987 [35100] was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not
939987 [35101] ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the
939987 [35102] cause of it all, I alone am to blame!â€
939987 [35103] 
939987 [35104] Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that
939987 [35105] she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest
939987 [35106] heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh,
939987 [35107] Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had
939987 [35108] carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it
939987 [35109] would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought
939987 [35110] so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her
939987 [35111] â€œtreacheryâ€ at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was
939987 [35112] impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries
939987 [35113] and hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and
939987 [35114] longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more
939987 [35115] difficult. He spoke of Mitya again.
939987 [35116] 
939987 [35117] â€œItâ€™s all right, itâ€™s all right, donâ€™t be anxious about him!â€ she began
939987 [35118] again, sharply and stubbornly. â€œAll that is only momentary, I know him, I
939987 [35119] know his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to escape.
939987 [35120] Itâ€™s not as though it would be immediately; he will have time to make up
939987 [35121] his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and will
939987 [35122] manage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it. Donâ€™t
939987 [35123] be anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed already: do you
939987 [35124] suppose he would give up that creature? And they wonâ€™t let her go to him,
939987 [35125] so he is bound to escape. Itâ€™s you heâ€™s most afraid of, he is afraid you
939987 [35126] wonâ€™t approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously
939987 [35127] _allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,â€ Katya added viciously. She
939987 [35128] paused and smiled.
939987 [35129] 
939987 [35130] â€œHe talks about some hymn,â€ she went on again, â€œsome cross he has to bear,
939987 [35131] some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal about it, and
939987 [35132] if you knew how he talked!â€ Katya cried suddenly, with feeling she could
939987 [35133] not repress, â€œif you knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment he
939987 [35134] told me, and how he hated him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heard
939987 [35135] his story and his tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I
939987 [35136] am responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable of
939987 [35137] suffering,â€ Katya concluded irritably. â€œCan such a man suffer? Men like
939987 [35138] him never suffer!â€
939987 [35139] 
939987 [35140] There was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words. And
939987 [35141] yet it was she who had betrayed him. â€œPerhaps because she feels how sheâ€™s
939987 [35142] wronged him she hates him at moments,â€ Alyosha thought to himself. He
939987 [35143] hoped that it was only â€œat moments.â€ In Katyaâ€™s last words he detected a
939987 [35144] challenging note, but he did not take it up.
939987 [35145] 
939987 [35146] â€œI sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself.
939987 [35147] Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable, cowardly,
939987 [35148] or something ... unchristian, perhaps?â€ Katya added, even more defiantly.
939987 [35149] 
939987 [35150] â€œOh, no. Iâ€™ll tell him everything,â€ muttered Alyosha. â€œHe asks you to come
939987 [35151] and see him to-day,â€ he blurted out suddenly, looking her steadily in the
939987 [35152] face. She started, and drew back a little from him on the sofa.
939987 [35153] 
939987 [35154] â€œMe? Can that be?â€ she faltered, turning pale.
939987 [35155] 
939987 [35156] â€œIt can and ought to be!â€ Alyosha began emphatically, growing more
939987 [35157] animated. â€œHe needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened the
939987 [35158] subject and worried you, if it were not necessary. He is ill, he is beside
939987 [35159] himself, he keeps asking for you. It is not to be reconciled with you that
939987 [35160] he wants you, but only that you would go and show yourself at his door. So
939987 [35161] much has happened to him since that day. He realizes that he has injured
939987 [35162] you beyond all reckoning. He does not ask your forgivenessâ€”â€˜Itâ€™s
939987 [35163] impossible to forgive me,â€™ he says himselfâ€”but only that you would show
939987 [35164] yourself in his doorway.â€
939987 [35165] 
939987 [35166] â€œItâ€™s so sudden....â€ faltered Katya. â€œIâ€™ve had a presentiment all these
939987 [35167] days that you would come with that message. I knew he would ask me to
939987 [35168] come. Itâ€™s impossible!â€
939987 [35169] 
939987 [35170] â€œLet it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the first
939987 [35171] time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never
939987 [35172] grasped it before so fully. He said, â€˜If she refuses to come I shall be
939987 [35173] unhappy all my life.â€™ Do you hear? though he is condemned to penal
939987 [35174] servitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happyâ€”is not that
939987 [35175] piteous? Thinkâ€”you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,â€
939987 [35176] broke like a challenge from Alyosha. â€œHis hands are clean, there is no
939987 [35177] blood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit
939987 [35178] him now. Go, greet him on his way into the darknessâ€”stand at his door,
939987 [35179] that is all.... You ought to do it, you ought to!â€ Alyosha concluded,
939987 [35180] laying immense stress on the word â€œought.â€
939987 [35181] 
939987 [35182] â€œI ought to ... but I cannot....â€ Katya moaned. â€œHe will look at me.... I
939987 [35183] canâ€™t.â€
939987 [35184] 
939987 [35185] â€œYour eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you donâ€™t
939987 [35186] make up your mind to do it now?â€
939987 [35187] 
939987 [35188] â€œBetter suffer all my life.â€
939987 [35189] 
939987 [35190] â€œYou ought to go, you ought to go,â€ Alyosha repeated with merciless
939987 [35191] emphasis.
939987 [35192] 
939987 [35193] â€œBut why to-day, why at once?... I canâ€™t leave our patientâ€”â€
939987 [35194] 
939987 [35195] â€œYou can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you donâ€™t come, he
939987 [35196] will be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity on
939987 [35197] him!â€
939987 [35198] 
939987 [35199] â€œHave pity on _me!_â€ Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst into
939987 [35200] tears.
939987 [35201] 
939987 [35202] â€œThen you will come,â€ said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. â€œIâ€™ll go and
939987 [35203] tell him you will come directly.â€
939987 [35204] 
939987 [35205] â€œNo, donâ€™t tell him so on any account,â€ cried Katya in alarm. â€œI will
939987 [35206] come, but donâ€™t tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not go
939987 [35207] in.... I donâ€™t know yetâ€”â€
939987 [35208] 
939987 [35209] Her voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go.
939987 [35210] 
939987 [35211] â€œAnd what if I meet any one?â€ she said suddenly, in a low voice, turning
939987 [35212] white again.
939987 [35213] 
939987 [35214] â€œThatâ€™s just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one. There will be
939987 [35215] no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,â€ he
939987 [35216] concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.
939987 [35217] 
939987 [35218] 
939987 [35219] 
939987 [35220] 
939987 [35221] Chapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes Truth
939987 [35222] 
939987 [35223] 
939987 [35224] He hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day after his
939987 [35225] fate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was sent
939987 [35226] to the prison division of the town hospital. But at the request of several
939987 [35227] persons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had put
939987 [35228] Mitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one
939987 [35229] where Smerdyakov had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at the
939987 [35230] other end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so
939987 [35231] that Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown, which
939987 [35232] was not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and compassionate
939987 [35233] young man. He knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass at
939987 [35234] once so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers, and that he
939987 [35235] must get used to it by degrees. The visits of relations and friends were
939987 [35236] informally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer, and even by the police
939987 [35237] captain. But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had
939987 [35238] tried to force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky
939987 [35239] not to admit him.
939987 [35240] 
939987 [35241] Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing-gown, rather
939987 [35242] feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his head. He
939987 [35243] looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression, but there
939987 [35244] was a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had become
939987 [35245] terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be silent for
939987 [35246] half an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily and
939987 [35247] painfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused himself from
939987 [35248] his brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness
939987 [35249] and never of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face
939987 [35250] of suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka
939987 [35251] than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but as
939987 [35252] soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy.
939987 [35253] 
939987 [35254] Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was
939987 [35255] waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a question.
939987 [35256] He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at the
939987 [35257] same time he felt that if she did not come, something inconceivable would
939987 [35258] happen. Alyosha understood his feelings.
939987 [35259] 
939987 [35260] â€œTrifon Borissovitch,â€ Mitya began nervously, â€œhas pulled his whole inn to
939987 [35261] pieces, I am told. Heâ€™s taken up the flooring, pulled apart the planks,
939987 [35262] split up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking treasure all the
939987 [35263] timeâ€”the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said Iâ€™d hidden
939987 [35264] there. He began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he got home.
939987 [35265] Serve him right, the swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he comes
939987 [35266] from there.â€
939987 [35267] 
939987 [35268] â€œListen,â€ began Alyosha. â€œShe will come, but I donâ€™t know when. Perhaps
939987 [35269] to-day, perhaps in a few days, that I canâ€™t tell. But she will come, she
939987 [35270] will, thatâ€™s certain.â€
939987 [35271] 
939987 [35272] Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The news had a
939987 [35273] tremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would have liked terribly
939987 [35274] to know what had been said, but he was again afraid to ask. Something
939987 [35275] cruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him like a knife at that
939987 [35276] moment.
939987 [35277] 
939987 [35278] â€œThis was what she said among other things; that I must be sure to set
939987 [35279] your conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well by then she
939987 [35280] will see to it all herself.â€
939987 [35281] 
939987 [35282] â€œYouâ€™ve spoken of that already,â€ Mitya observed musingly.
939987 [35283] 
939987 [35284] â€œAnd you have repeated it to Grusha,â€ observed Alyosha.
939987 [35285] 
939987 [35286] â€œYes,â€ Mitya admitted. â€œShe wonâ€™t come this morning.â€ He looked timidly at
939987 [35287] his brother. â€œShe wonâ€™t come till the evening. When I told her yesterday
939987 [35288] that Katya was taking measures, she was silent, but she set her mouth. She
939987 [35289] only whispered, â€˜Let her!â€™ She understood that it was important. I did not
939987 [35290] dare to try her further. She understands now, I think, that Katya no
939987 [35291] longer cares for me, but loves Ivan.â€
939987 [35292] 
939987 [35293] â€œDoes she?â€ broke from Alyosha.
939987 [35294] 
939987 [35295] â€œPerhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,â€ Mitya
939987 [35296] hastened to explain again; â€œI asked her to do something for me. You know,
939987 [35297] Ivan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not us. He will recover.â€
939987 [35298] 
939987 [35299] â€œWould you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she scarcely
939987 [35300] doubts of his recovery,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [35301] 
939987 [35302] â€œThat means that she is convinced he will die. Itâ€™s because she is
939987 [35303] frightened sheâ€™s so sure he will get well.â€
939987 [35304] 
939987 [35305] â€œIvan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe thereâ€™s every hope
939987 [35306] that he will get well,â€ Alyosha observed anxiously.
939987 [35307] 
939987 [35308] â€œYes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die. She has a
939987 [35309] great deal of sorrow to bear...â€ A silence followed. A grave anxiety was
939987 [35310] fretting Mitya.
939987 [35311] 
939987 [35312] â€œAlyosha, I love Grusha terribly,â€ he said suddenly in a shaking voice,
939987 [35313] full of tears.
939987 [35314] 
939987 [35315] â€œThey wonâ€™t let her go out there to you,â€ Alyosha put in at once.
939987 [35316] 
939987 [35317] â€œAnd there is something else I wanted to tell you,â€ Mitya went on, with a
939987 [35318] sudden ring in his voice. â€œIf they beat me on the way or out there, I
939987 [35319] wonâ€™t submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it. And
939987 [35320] this will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as it is.
939987 [35321] Iâ€™ve been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself. I am not
939987 [35322] ready! I am not able to resign myself. I wanted to sing a â€˜hymnâ€™; but if a
939987 [35323] guard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it. For Grusha
939987 [35324] I would bear anything ... anything except blows.... But she wonâ€™t be
939987 [35325] allowed to come there.â€
939987 [35326] 
939987 [35327] Alyosha smiled gently.
939987 [35328] 
939987 [35329] â€œListen, brother, once for all,â€ he said. â€œThis is what I think about it.
939987 [35330] And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not ready,
939987 [35331] and such a cross is not for you. Whatâ€™s more, you donâ€™t need such a
939987 [35332] martyrâ€™s cross when you are not ready for it. If you had murdered our
939987 [35333] father, it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment. But you
939987 [35334] are innocent, and such a cross is too much for you. You wanted to make
939987 [35335] yourself another man by suffering. I say, only remember that other man
939987 [35336] always, all your life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for
939987 [35337] you. Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all
939987 [35338] your life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more to
939987 [35339] make you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For there you would
939987 [35340] not endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would say: â€˜I am
939987 [35341] quits.â€™ The lawyer was right about that. Such heavy burdens are not for
939987 [35342] all men. For some they are impossible. These are my thoughts about it, if
939987 [35343] you want them so much. If other men would have to answer for your escape,
939987 [35344] officers or soldiers, then I would not have â€˜allowedâ€™ you,â€ smiled
939987 [35345] Alyosha. â€œBut they declareâ€”the superintendent of that _Ã©tape_ told Ivan
939987 [35346] himselfâ€”that if itâ€™s well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that
939987 [35347] they can get off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a
939987 [35348] case, but I canâ€™t undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya
939987 [35349] commissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes. I must
939987 [35350] tell you the truth. And so I canâ€™t judge of your own action. But let me
939987 [35351] assure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would be a strange thing
939987 [35352] if I could judge you in this. Now I think Iâ€™ve gone into everything.â€
939987 [35353] 
939987 [35354] â€œBut I do condemn myself!â€ cried Mitya. â€œI shall escape, that was settled
939987 [35355] apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away? But I
939987 [35356] shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. Thatâ€™s how the
939987 [35357] Jesuits talk, isnâ€™t it? Just as we are doing?â€
939987 [35358] 
939987 [35359] â€œYes.â€ Alyosha smiled gently.
939987 [35360] 
939987 [35361] â€œI love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything,â€
939987 [35362] cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. â€œSo Iâ€™ve caught my Alyosha being
939987 [35363] Jesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest; Iâ€™ll open
939987 [35364] the other side of my heart to you. This is what I planned and decided. If
939987 [35365] I run away, even with money and a passport, and even to America, I should
939987 [35366] be cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, not
939987 [35367] for happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is as
939987 [35368] bad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already. Even though
939987 [35369] Grusha will be with me. Just look at her; is she an American? She is
939987 [35370] Russian, Russian to the marrow of her bones; she will be homesick for the
939987 [35371] mother country, and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for my
939987 [35372] sake, that she has taken up that cross for me. And what harm has she done?
939987 [35373] And how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out there, though they may be
939987 [35374] better than I, every one of them? I hate that America already! And though
939987 [35375] they may be wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are
939987 [35376] not of my soul. I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I
939987 [35377] am a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there!â€ he exclaimed, his eyes
939987 [35378] suddenly flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. â€œSo this is what
939987 [35379] Iâ€™ve decided, Alyosha, listen,â€ he began again, mastering his emotion. â€œAs
939987 [35380] soon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on the
939987 [35381] land, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears. There must be
939987 [35382] some remote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there,
939987 [35383] somewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to the country of the _Last of
939987 [35384] the Mohicans_, and there weâ€™ll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I.
939987 [35385] Work and grammarâ€”thatâ€™s how weâ€™ll spend three years. And by that time we
939987 [35386] shall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as weâ€™ve learnt
939987 [35387] itâ€”good-by to America! Weâ€™ll run here to Russia as American citizens.
939987 [35388] Donâ€™t be uneasyâ€”we would not come to this little town. Weâ€™d hide
939987 [35389] somewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall be
939987 [35390] changed by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors shall
939987 [35391] make me some sort of wart on my faceâ€”whatâ€™s the use of their being so
939987 [35392] mechanical!â€”or else Iâ€™ll put out one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and I
939987 [35393] shall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say they wonâ€™t recognize us.
939987 [35394] And if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I donâ€™t care. It will show
939987 [35395] itâ€™s our fate. Weâ€™ll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds,
939987 [35396] and Iâ€™ll make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our own
939987 [35397] soil. Thatâ€™s my plan, and it shanâ€™t be altered. Do you approve?â€
939987 [35398] 
939987 [35399] â€œYes,â€ said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for a
939987 [35400] minute and said suddenly:
939987 [35401] 
939987 [35402] â€œAnd how they worked it up at the trial! Didnâ€™t they work it up!â€
939987 [35403] 
939987 [35404] â€œIf they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,â€ said
939987 [35405] Alyosha, with a sigh.
939987 [35406] 
939987 [35407] â€œYes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but itâ€™s hard,â€ Mitya
939987 [35408] moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.
939987 [35409] 
939987 [35410] â€œAlyosha, put me out of my misery at once!â€ he exclaimed suddenly. â€œTell
939987 [35411] me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she say
939987 [35412] it?â€
939987 [35413] 
939987 [35414] â€œShe said she would come, but I donâ€™t know whether she will come to-day.
939987 [35415] Itâ€™s hard for her, you know,â€ Alyosha looked timidly at his brother.
939987 [35416] 
939987 [35417] â€œI should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of my
939987 [35418] mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my heart:
939987 [35419] what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? Itâ€™s the
939987 [35420] headstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a
939987 [35421] scoundrel, thatâ€™s all one can say.â€
939987 [35422] 
939987 [35423] â€œHere she is!â€ cried Alyosha.
939987 [35424] 
939987 [35425] At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood
939987 [35426] still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt impulsively to
939987 [35427] his feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale, but a
939987 [35428] timid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with an
939987 [35429] irresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it, she flew
939987 [35430] impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and almost by force made
939987 [35431] him sit down on the bed. She sat down beside him, and still keeping his
939987 [35432] hands pressed them violently. Several times they both strove to speak, but
939987 [35433] stopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes
939987 [35434] fastened on one another. So passed two minutes.
939987 [35435] 
939987 [35436] â€œHave you forgiven me?â€ Mitya faltered at last, and at the same moment
939987 [35437] turning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried, â€œDo you hear what
939987 [35438] I am asking, do you hear?â€
939987 [35439] 
939987 [35440] â€œThatâ€™s what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!â€ broke from
939987 [35441] Katya. â€œMy forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether you
939987 [35442] forgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and I in
939987 [35443] yoursâ€”so it must be....â€ She stopped to take breath. â€œWhat have I come
939987 [35444] for?â€ she began again with nervous haste: â€œto embrace your feet, to press
939987 [35445] your hands like this, till it hurtsâ€”you remember how in Moscow I used to
939987 [35446] squeeze themâ€”to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you
939987 [35447] that I love you madly,â€ she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his
939987 [35448] hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha stood
939987 [35449] speechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was seeing.
939987 [35450] 
939987 [35451] â€œLove is over, Mitya!â€ Katya began again, â€œbut the past is painfully dear
939987 [35452] to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have been
939987 [35453] come true for one minute,â€ she faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into
939987 [35454] his face joyfully again. â€œYou love another woman, and I love another man,
939987 [35455] and yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that?
939987 [35456] Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life!â€ she cried, with a quiver
939987 [35457] almost of menace in her voice.
939987 [35458] 
939987 [35459] â€œI shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,â€ Mitya began, drawing a
939987 [35460] deep breath at each word, â€œdo you know, five days ago, that same evening,
939987 [35461] I loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life!
939987 [35462] So it will be, so it will always beâ€”â€
939987 [35463] 
939987 [35464] So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhaps
939987 [35465] not even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believed
939987 [35466] what they said implicitly.
939987 [35467] 
939987 [35468] â€œKatya,â€ cried Mitya suddenly, â€œdo you believe I murdered him? I know you
939987 [35469] donâ€™t believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence.... Surely,
939987 [35470] surely you did not believe it!â€
939987 [35471] 
939987 [35472] â€œI did not believe it even then. Iâ€™ve never believed it. I hated you, and
939987 [35473] for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuaded
939987 [35474] myself and believed it, but when Iâ€™d finished speaking I left off
939987 [35475] believing it at once. Donâ€™t doubt that! I have forgotten that I came here
939987 [35476] to punish myself,â€ she said, with a new expression in her voice, quite
939987 [35477] unlike the loving tones of a moment before.
939987 [35478] 
939987 [35479] â€œWoman, yours is a heavy burden,â€ broke, as it were, involuntarily from
939987 [35480] Mitya.
939987 [35481] 
939987 [35482] â€œLet me go,â€ she whispered. â€œIâ€™ll come again. Itâ€™s more than I can bear
939987 [35483] now.â€
939987 [35484] 
939987 [35485] She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and
939987 [35486] staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room.
939987 [35487] No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she
939987 [35488] reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and
939987 [35489] moaned softly, almost in a whisper:
939987 [35490] 
939987 [35491] â€œForgive me!â€
939987 [35492] 
939987 [35493] Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,
939987 [35494] venomous voice, answered:
939987 [35495] 
939987 [35496] â€œWe are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As
939987 [35497] though we could forgive one another! Save him, and Iâ€™ll worship you all my
939987 [35498] life.â€
939987 [35499] 
939987 [35500] â€œYou wonâ€™t forgive her!â€ cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.
939987 [35501] 
939987 [35502] â€œDonâ€™t be anxious, Iâ€™ll save him for you!â€ Katya whispered rapidly, and
939987 [35503] she ran out of the room.
939987 [35504] 
939987 [35505] â€œAnd you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness
939987 [35506] herself?â€ Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.
939987 [35507] 
939987 [35508] â€œMitya, donâ€™t dare to blame her; you have no right to!â€ Alyosha cried
939987 [35509] hotly.
939987 [35510] 
939987 [35511] â€œHer proud lips spoke, not her heart,â€ Grushenka brought out in a tone of
939987 [35512] disgust. â€œIf she saves you Iâ€™ll forgive her everythingâ€”â€
939987 [35513] 
939987 [35514] She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yet
939987 [35515] recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally,
939987 [35516] with no suspicion of what she would meet.
939987 [35517] 
939987 [35518] â€œAlyosha, run after her!â€ Mitya cried to his brother; â€œtell her ... I
939987 [35519] donâ€™t know ... donâ€™t let her go away like this!â€
939987 [35520] 
939987 [35521] â€œIâ€™ll come to you again at nightfall,â€ said Alyosha, and he ran after
939987 [35522] Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast,
939987 [35523] but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly:
939987 [35524] 
939987 [35525] â€œNo, before that woman I canâ€™t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness
939987 [35526] because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive
939987 [35527] me.... I like her for that!â€ she added, in an unnatural voice, and her
939987 [35528] eyes flashed with fierce resentment.
939987 [35529] 
939987 [35530] â€œMy brother did not expect this in the least,â€ muttered Alyosha. â€œHe was
939987 [35531] sure she would not comeâ€”â€
939987 [35532] 
939987 [35533] â€œNo doubt. Let us leave that,â€ she snapped. â€œListen: I canâ€™t go with you
939987 [35534] to the funeral now. Iâ€™ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money.
939987 [35535] If necessary, tell them Iâ€™ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave
939987 [35536] me, please. You are late as it isâ€”the bells are ringing for the
939987 [35537] service.... Leave me, please!â€
939987 [35538] 
939987 [35539] 
939987 [35540] 
939987 [35541] 
939987 [35542] Chapter III. Ilushaâ€™s Funeral. The Speech At The Stone
939987 [35543] 
939987 [35544] 
939987 [35545] He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to
939987 [35546] bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him. It
939987 [35547] was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was
939987 [35548] sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the
939987 [35549] boys, Ilushaâ€™s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him
939987 [35550] and were glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,
939987 [35551] they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. â€œFather
939987 [35552] will cry, be with father,â€ Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the
939987 [35553] boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.
939987 [35554] 
939987 [35555] â€œHow glad I am youâ€™ve come, Karamazov!â€ he cried, holding out his hand to
939987 [35556] Alyosha. â€œItâ€™s awful here. Itâ€™s really horrible to see it. Snegiryov is
939987 [35557] not drunk, we know for a fact heâ€™s had nothing to drink to-day, but he
939987 [35558] seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful.
939987 [35559] Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?â€
939987 [35560] 
939987 [35561] â€œWhat is it, Kolya?â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [35562] 
939987 [35563] â€œIs your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or was
939987 [35564] it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I havenâ€™t slept for the last four
939987 [35565] nights for thinking of it.â€
939987 [35566] 
939987 [35567] â€œThe valet killed him, my brother is innocent,â€ answered Alyosha.
939987 [35568] 
939987 [35569] â€œThatâ€™s what I said,â€ cried Smurov.
939987 [35570] 
939987 [35571] â€œSo he will perish an innocent victim!â€ exclaimed Kolya; â€œthough he is
939987 [35572] ruined he is happy! I could envy him!â€
939987 [35573] 
939987 [35574] â€œWhat do you mean? How can you? Why?â€ cried Alyosha surprised.
939987 [35575] 
939987 [35576] â€œOh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!â€ said Kolya
939987 [35577] with enthusiasm.
939987 [35578] 
939987 [35579] â€œBut not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!â€ said
939987 [35580] Alyosha.
939987 [35581] 
939987 [35582] â€œOf course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for disgrace,
939987 [35583] I donâ€™t care about thatâ€”our names may perish. I respect your brother!â€
939987 [35584] 
939987 [35585] â€œAnd so do I!â€ the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had founded
939987 [35586] Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his ears like
939987 [35587] a peony as he had done on that occasion.
939987 [35588] 
939987 [35589] Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and his eyes
939987 [35590] closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His thin face was
939987 [35591] hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of decay from
939987 [35592] the corpse. The expression of his face was serious and, as it were,
939987 [35593] thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his breast, looked particularly
939987 [35594] beautiful, as though chiseled in marble. There were flowers in his hands
939987 [35595] and the coffin, inside and out, was decked with flowers, which had been
939987 [35596] sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too
939987 [35597] from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had
939987 [35598] a bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear
939987 [35599] boy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not look
939987 [35600] at any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, â€œmamma,â€ who kept trying to
939987 [35601] stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had
939987 [35602] been pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat with
939987 [35603] her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly weeping.
939987 [35604] Snegiryovâ€™s face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There was
939987 [35605] something crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him. â€œOld
939987 [35606] man, dear old man!â€ he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was
939987 [35607] his habit to call Ilusha â€œold man,â€ as a term of affection when he was
939987 [35608] alive.
939987 [35609] 
939987 [35610] â€œFather, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his hand and
939987 [35611] give it me,â€ the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either because the
939987 [35612] little white rose in Ilushaâ€™s hand had caught her fancy or that she wanted
939987 [35613] one from his hand to keep in memory of him, she moved restlessly,
939987 [35614] stretching out her hands for the flower.
939987 [35615] 
939987 [35616] â€œI wonâ€™t give it to any one, I wonâ€™t give you anything,â€ Snegiryov cried
939987 [35617] callously. â€œThey are his flowers, not yours! Everything is his, nothing is
939987 [35618] yours!â€
939987 [35619] 
939987 [35620] â€œFather, give mother a flower!â€ said Nina, lifting her face wet with
939987 [35621] tears.
939987 [35622] 
939987 [35623] â€œI wonâ€™t give away anything and to her less than any one! She didnâ€™t love
939987 [35624] Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it to her,â€ the
939987 [35625] captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given up his
939987 [35626] cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in noiseless
939987 [35627] tears, hiding her face in her hands.
939987 [35628] 
939987 [35629] The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that it
939987 [35630] was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began to
939987 [35631] lift it up.
939987 [35632] 
939987 [35633] â€œI donâ€™t want him to be buried in the churchyard,â€ Snegiryov wailed
939987 [35634] suddenly; â€œIâ€™ll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha told me to. I
939987 [35635] wonâ€™t let him be carried out!â€
939987 [35636] 
939987 [35637] He had been saying for the last three days that he would bury him by the
939987 [35638] stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all the boys
939987 [35639] interfered.
939987 [35640] 
939987 [35641] â€œWhat an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had hanged
939987 [35642] himself!â€ the old landlady said sternly. â€œThere in the churchyard the
939987 [35643] ground has been crossed. Heâ€™ll be prayed for there. One can hear the
939987 [35644] singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it
939987 [35645] will reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave.â€
939987 [35646] 
939987 [35647] At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, â€œTake him
939987 [35648] where you will.â€ The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed the
939987 [35649] mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might say
939987 [35650] good-by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little face, which for the
939987 [35651] last three days she had only looked at from a distance, she trembled all
939987 [35652] over and her gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin.
939987 [35653] 
939987 [35654] â€œMother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your blessing, kiss
939987 [35655] him,â€ Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched like an automaton and
939987 [35656] with a face contorted with bitter grief she began, without a word, beating
939987 [35657] her breast with her fist. They carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed
939987 [35658] her lips to her brotherâ€™s for the last time as they bore the coffin by
939987 [35659] her. As Alyosha went out of the house he begged the landlady to look after
939987 [35660] those who were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had
939987 [35661] finished.
939987 [35662] 
939987 [35663] â€œTo be sure, Iâ€™ll stay with them, we are Christians, too.â€ The old woman
939987 [35664] wept as she said it.
939987 [35665] 
939987 [35666] They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than three
939987 [35667] hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost. The church
939987 [35668] bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the
939987 [35669] coffin, in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare and his soft,
939987 [35670] old, wide-brimmed hat in his hand. He seemed in a state of bewildered
939987 [35671] anxiety. At one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head of
939987 [35672] the coffin and only hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and
939987 [35673] tried to find a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he
939987 [35674] rushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the
939987 [35675] loss of that flower.
939987 [35676] 
939987 [35677] â€œAnd the crust of bread, weâ€™ve forgotten the crust!â€ he cried suddenly in
939987 [35678] dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust of
939987 [35679] bread already and that it was in his pocket. He instantly pulled it out
939987 [35680] and was reassured.
939987 [35681] 
939987 [35682] â€œIlusha told me to, Ilusha,â€ he explained at once to Alyosha. â€œI was
939987 [35683] sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: â€˜Father, when my grave
939987 [35684] is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly
939987 [35685] down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone.â€™ â€
939987 [35686] 
939987 [35687] â€œThatâ€™s a good thing,â€ said Alyosha, â€œwe must often take some.â€
939987 [35688] 
939987 [35689] â€œEvery day, every day!â€ said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at the
939987 [35690] thought.
939987 [35691] 
939987 [35692] They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it.
939987 [35693] The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all through
939987 [35694] the service. It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons were
939987 [35695] without settings; but such churches are the best for praying in. During
939987 [35696] the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had
939987 [35697] outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At
939987 [35698] one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the
939987 [35699] wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it
939987 [35700] and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood
939987 [35701] quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity.
939987 [35702] After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing
939987 [35703] beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not
939987 [35704] explain what he meant. During the prayer, â€œLike the Cherubim,â€ he joined
939987 [35705] in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he
939987 [35706] pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.
939987 [35707] 
939987 [35708] At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The
939987 [35709] distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and
939987 [35710] impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly
939987 [35711] to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at
939987 [35712] first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking
939987 [35713] leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as
939987 [35714] though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and
939987 [35715] persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in
939987 [35716] persuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively
939987 [35717] stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He
939987 [35718] looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he
939987 [35719] apparently forgot his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink into
939987 [35720] brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to
939987 [35721] the grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church,
939987 [35722] Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary rites the
939987 [35723] grave-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his flowers in his hands
939987 [35724] bent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coat
939987 [35725] in alarm and pulled him back. He did not seem to understand fully what was
939987 [35726] happening. When they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed
939987 [35727] anxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no
939987 [35728] one could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he was
939987 [35729] reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited,
939987 [35730] snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the
939987 [35731] morsels on the grave.
939987 [35732] 
939987 [35733] â€œCome, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!â€ he muttered anxiously.
939987 [35734] 
939987 [35735] One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the bread
939987 [35736] with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to some
939987 [35737] one to hold for a time. But he would not do this and seemed indeed
939987 [35738] suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they wanted to take them from
939987 [35739] him altogether. And after looking at the grave, and as it were, satisfying
939987 [35740] himself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled, he
939987 [35741] suddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and
939987 [35742] made his way homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he
939987 [35743] almost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.
939987 [35744] 
939987 [35745] â€œThe flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind to
939987 [35746] mamma,â€ he began exclaiming suddenly.
939987 [35747] 
939987 [35748] Some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he flung the
939987 [35749] hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating, â€œI wonâ€™t have
939987 [35750] the hat, I wonâ€™t have the hat.â€ Smurov picked it up and carried it after
939987 [35751] him. All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy who discovered about
939987 [35752] Troy most of all. Though Smurov, with the captainâ€™s hat in his hand, was
939987 [35753] crying bitterly too, he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red
939987 [35754] brick that lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of
939987 [35755] sparrows that was flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying
939987 [35756] as he ran. Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a
939987 [35757] minute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the
939987 [35758] church, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly overtook
939987 [35759] him and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell helpless on the snow
939987 [35760] as though he had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing,
939987 [35761] he began crying out, â€œIlusha, old man, dear old man!â€ Alyosha and Kolya
939987 [35762] tried to make him get up, soothing and persuading him.
939987 [35763] 
939987 [35764] â€œCaptain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,â€ muttered Kolya.
939987 [35765] 
939987 [35766] â€œYouâ€™ll spoil the flowers,â€ said Alyosha, â€œand mamma is expecting them,
939987 [35767] she is sitting crying because you would not give her any before. Ilushaâ€™s
939987 [35768] little bed is still thereâ€”â€
939987 [35769] 
939987 [35770] â€œYes, yes, mamma!â€ Snegiryov suddenly recollected, â€œtheyâ€™ll take away the
939987 [35771] bed, theyâ€™ll take it away,â€ he added as though alarmed that they really
939987 [35772] would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far off and
939987 [35773] they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called
939987 [35774] to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just before:
939987 [35775] 
939987 [35776] â€œMamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,â€ he
939987 [35777] cried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen
939987 [35778] and broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that instant he saw
939987 [35779] in the corner, by the little bed, Ilushaâ€™s little boots, which the
939987 [35780] landlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old, patched,
939987 [35781] rusty-looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them, fell
939987 [35782] on his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his lips to it, began
939987 [35783] kissing it greedily, crying, â€œIlusha, old man, dear old man, where are
939987 [35784] your little feet?â€
939987 [35785] 
939987 [35786] â€œWhere have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?â€ the lunatic
939987 [35787] cried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran out
939987 [35788] of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out.
939987 [35789] 
939987 [35790] â€œLet them weep,â€ he said to Kolya, â€œitâ€™s no use trying to comfort them
939987 [35791] just now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.â€
939987 [35792] 
939987 [35793] â€œNo, itâ€™s no use, itâ€™s awful,â€ Kolya assented. â€œDo you know, Karamazov,â€
939987 [35794] he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, â€œI feel dreadfully
939987 [35795] sad, and if it were only possible to bring him back, Iâ€™d give anything in
939987 [35796] the world to do it.â€
939987 [35797] 
939987 [35798] â€œAh, so would I,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [35799] 
939987 [35800] â€œWhat do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to-night?
939987 [35801] Heâ€™ll be drunk, you know.â€
939987 [35802] 
939987 [35803] â€œPerhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to
939987 [35804] spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come together
939987 [35805] we shall remind them of everything again,â€ Alyosha suggested.
939987 [35806] 
939987 [35807] â€œThe landlady is laying the table for them nowâ€”thereâ€™ll be a funeral
939987 [35808] dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it,
939987 [35809] Karamazov?â€
939987 [35810] 
939987 [35811] â€œOf course,â€ said Alyosha.
939987 [35812] 
939987 [35813] â€œItâ€™s all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it,
939987 [35814] it all seems so unnatural in our religion.â€
939987 [35815] 
939987 [35816] â€œThey are going to have salmon, too,â€ the boy who had discovered about
939987 [35817] Troy observed in a loud voice.
939987 [35818] 
939987 [35819] â€œI beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your
939987 [35820] idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesnâ€™t
939987 [35821] care to know whether you exist or not!â€ Kolya snapped out irritably. The
939987 [35822] boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.
939987 [35823] 
939987 [35824] Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov
939987 [35825] exclaimed:
939987 [35826] 
939987 [35827] â€œThereâ€™s Ilushaâ€™s stone, under which they wanted to bury him.â€
939987 [35828] 
939987 [35829] They all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the whole
939987 [35830] picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha,
939987 [35831] weeping and hugging his father, had cried, â€œFather, father, how he
939987 [35832] insulted you,â€ rose at once before his imagination.
939987 [35833] 
939987 [35834] A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and earnest
939987 [35835] expression he looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant faces of
939987 [35836] Ilushaâ€™s schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:
939987 [35837] 
939987 [35838] â€œBoys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.â€
939987 [35839] 
939987 [35840] The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes
939987 [35841] upon him.
939987 [35842] 
939987 [35843] â€œBoys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two brothers,
939987 [35844] of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at deathâ€™s door.
939987 [35845] But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long time, so we shall
939987 [35846] part. Let us make a compact here, at Ilushaâ€™s stone, that we will never
939987 [35847] forget Ilusha and one another. And whatever happens to us later in life,
939987 [35848] if we donâ€™t meet for twenty years afterwards, let us always remember how
939987 [35849] we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, by
939987 [35850] the bridge? and afterwards we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine boy,
939987 [35851] a kind-hearted, brave boy, he felt for his fatherâ€™s honor and resented the
939987 [35852] cruel insult to him and stood up for him. And so in the first place, we
939987 [35853] will remember him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied with
939987 [35854] most important things, if we attain to honor or fall into great
939987 [35855] misfortuneâ€”still let us remember how good it was once here, when we were
939987 [35856] all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for the
939987 [35857] time we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we are. My little
939987 [35858] dovesâ€”let me call you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blue
939987 [35859] birds, at this minute as I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,
939987 [35860] perhaps you wonâ€™t understand what I am saying to you, because I often
939987 [35861] speak very unintelligibly, but youâ€™ll remember it all the same and will
939987 [35862] agree with my words some time. You must know that there is nothing higher
939987 [35863] and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some
939987 [35864] good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you
939987 [35865] a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved
939987 [35866] from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such
939987 [35867] memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one
939987 [35868] has only one good memory left in oneâ€™s heart, even that may sometime be
939987 [35869] the means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may be
939987 [35870] unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at menâ€™s tears and at those
939987 [35871] people who say as Kolya did just now, â€˜I want to suffer for all men,â€™ and
939987 [35872] may even jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we may
939987 [35873] becomeâ€”which God forbidâ€”yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how we
939987 [35874] loved him in his last days, and how we have been talking like friends all
939987 [35875] together, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of usâ€”if we do
939987 [35876] become soâ€”will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at
939987 [35877] this moment! Whatâ€™s more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from great
939987 [35878] evil and he will reflect and say, â€˜Yes, I was good and brave and honest
939987 [35879] then!â€™ Let him laugh to himself, thatâ€™s no matter, a man often laughs at
939987 [35880] whatâ€™s good and kind. Thatâ€™s only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you,
939987 [35881] boys, that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, â€˜No, I do wrong
939987 [35882] to laugh, for thatâ€™s not a thing to laugh at.â€™ â€
939987 [35883] 
939987 [35884] â€œThat will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!â€ cried Kolya, with flashing
939987 [35885] eyes.
939987 [35886] 
939987 [35887] The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but they
939987 [35888] restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker.
939987 [35889] 
939987 [35890] â€œI say this in case we become bad,â€ Alyosha went on, â€œbut thereâ€™s no
939987 [35891] reason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be, first and
939987 [35892] above all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other! I
939987 [35893] say that again. I give you my word for my part that Iâ€™ll never forget one
939987 [35894] of you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty
939987 [35895] years. Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know
939987 [35896] whether he exists or not. But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and
939987 [35897] that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of
939987 [35898] Troy, but is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys,
939987 [35899] my dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave
939987 [35900] and generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when he
939987 [35901] is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as
939987 [35902] Kartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all dear to me,
939987 [35903] boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart for you all, and I
939987 [35904] beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me! Well, and who has united us
939987 [35905] in this kind, good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember
939987 [35906] all our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to
939987 [35907] us for ever! Let us never forget him. May his memory live for ever in our
939987 [35908] hearts from this time forth!â€
939987 [35909] 
939987 [35910] â€œYes, yes, for ever, for ever!â€ the boys cried in their ringing voices,
939987 [35911] with softened faces.
939987 [35912] 
939987 [35913] â€œLet us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots, his
939987 [35914] coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he stood up for him
939987 [35915] alone against the whole school.â€
939987 [35916] 
939987 [35917] â€œWe will remember, we will remember,â€ cried the boys. â€œHe was brave, he
939987 [35918] was good!â€
939987 [35919] 
939987 [35920] â€œAh, how I loved him!â€ exclaimed Kolya.
939987 [35921] 
939987 [35922] â€œAh, children, ah, dear friends, donâ€™t be afraid of life! How good life is
939987 [35923] when one does something good and just!â€
939987 [35924] 
939987 [35925] â€œYes, yes,â€ the boys repeated enthusiastically.
939987 [35926] 
939987 [35927] â€œKaramazov, we love you!â€ a voice, probably Kartashovâ€™s, cried
939987 [35928] impulsively.
939987 [35929] 
939987 [35930] â€œWe love you, we love you!â€ they all caught it up. There were tears in the
939987 [35931] eyes of many of them.
939987 [35932] 
939987 [35933] â€œHurrah for Karamazov!â€ Kolya shouted ecstatically.
939987 [35934] 
939987 [35935] â€œAnd may the dead boyâ€™s memory live for ever!â€ Alyosha added again with
939987 [35936] feeling.
939987 [35937] 
939987 [35938] â€œFor ever!â€ the boys chimed in again.
939987 [35939] 
939987 [35940] â€œKaramazov,â€ cried Kolya, â€œcan it be true whatâ€™s taught us in religion,
939987 [35941] that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each
939987 [35942] other again, all, Ilusha too?â€
939987 [35943] 
939987 [35944] â€œCertainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other and
939987 [35945] shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!â€
939987 [35946] Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.
939987 [35947] 
939987 [35948] â€œAh, how splendid it will be!â€ broke from Kolya.
939987 [35949] 
939987 [35950] â€œWell, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner. Donâ€™t be
939987 [35951] put out at our eating pancakesâ€”itâ€™s a very old custom and thereâ€™s
939987 [35952] something nice in that!â€ laughed Alyosha. â€œWell, let us go! And now we go
939987 [35953] hand in hand.â€
939987 [35954] 
939987 [35955] â€œAnd always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!â€ Kolya
939987 [35956] cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up his
939987 [35957] exclamation: â€œHurrah for Karamazov!â€

939987 [36351] 
939987 [36352] 
939987 [36353] Project Gutenbergâ„¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
939987 [36354] works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
939987 [36355] obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
939987 [36356] efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
939987 [36357] of life.
939987 [36358] 
939987 [36359] Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
939987 [36360] they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ„¢â€™s goals and ensuring
939987 [36361] that the Project Gutenbergâ„¢ collection will remain freely available for
939987 [36362] generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
939987 [36363] Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
939987 [36364] Project Gutenbergâ„¢ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
939987 [36365] Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
939987 [36366] can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at

939987 [36406] 
939987 [36407] 
939987 [36408] Project Gutenbergâ„¢ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
939987 [36409] public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
939987 [36410] number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
939987 [36411] in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
939987 [36412] including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
939987 [36413] particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
939987 [36414] 
939987 [36415] The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
939987 [36416] charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
939987 [36417] Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
939987 [36418] effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
939987 [36419] requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
939987 [36420] received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
939987 [36421] determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit

939987 [36423] 
939987 [36424] While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
939987 [36425] not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
939987 [36426] accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
939987 [36427] with offers to donate.
939987 [36428] 
939987 [36429] International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
939987 [36430] statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
939987 [36431] United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
939987 [36432] 
939987 [36433] Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
939987 [36434] and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
939987 [36435] checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

939987 [36442]       General Information About Project Gutenbergâ„¢ electronic works.
939987 [36443] 
939987 [36444] 
939987 [36445] Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ„¢
939987 [36446] concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
939987 [36447] anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ„¢
939987 [36448] eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
939987 [36449] 
939987 [36450] Project Gutenbergâ„¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
939987 [36451] all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
939987 [36452] notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
939987 [36453] with any particular paper edition.
939987 [36454] 
939987 [36455] Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBookâ€™s eBook
939987 [36456] number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
939987 [36457] (zipped), HTML and others.
939987 [36458] 
939987 [36459] Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
939987 [36460] old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
939987 [36461] _Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
939987 [36462] new filenames and etext numbers.

939987 [36521] TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE
939987 [36522] 
939987 [36523] A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to
939987 [36524] understand his work.
939987 [36525] 
939987 [36526] Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working
939987 [36527] and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five
939987 [36528] children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings
939987 [36529] in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious
939987 [36530] character.
939987 [36531] 
939987 [36532] Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the
939987 [36533] final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had
939987 [36534] already begun his first work, "Poor Folk."
939987 [36535] 
939987 [36536] This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and
939987 [36537] was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself
939987 [36538] instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career
939987 [36539] seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he
939987 [36540] was arrested.
939987 [36541] 
939987 [36542] Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky
939987 [36543] was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier
939987 [36544] and Proudhon. He was accused of "taking part in conversations against
939987 [36545] the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of
939987 [36546] knowing of the intention to set up a printing press." Under Nicholas
939987 [36547] I. (that "stern and just man," as Maurice Baring calls him) this was
939987 [36548] enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months' imprisonment
939987 [36549] he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to
939987 [36550] be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: "They snapped
939987 [36551] words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by
939987 [36552] persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,
939987 [36553] to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only
939987 [36554] a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and
939987 [36555] I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to
939987 [36556] bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,
939987 [36557] brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared
939987 [36558] us our lives." The sentence was commuted to hard labour.
939987 [36559] 
939987 [36560] One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and
939987 [36561] never regained his sanity.
939987 [36562] 
939987 [36563] The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on
939987 [36564] Dostoevsky's mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to
939987 [36565] accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing
939987 [36566] in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.
939987 [36567] He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the
939987 [36568] cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal
939987 [36569] servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where
939987 [36570] he began the "Dead House," and some years of service in a disciplinary
939987 [36571] battalion.
939987 [36572] 
939987 [36573] He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest
939987 [36574] and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he
939987 [36575] suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times
939987 [36576] a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was
939987 [36577] allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--"Vremya," which was
939987 [36578] forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost
939987 [36579] his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet
939987 [36580] he took upon himself the payment of his brother's debts. He started
939987 [36581] another journal--"The Epoch," which within a few months was also
939987 [36582] prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother's family was
939987 [36583] dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is
939987 [36584] said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were
939987 [36585] much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.
939987 [36586] 
939987 [36587] In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the
939987 [36588] monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary
939987 [36589] demonstrations of love and honour.
939987 [36590] 
939987 [36591] A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a
939987 [36592] vast multitude of mourners, who "gave the hapless man the funeral of a
939987 [36593] king." He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.
939987 [36594] 
939987 [36595] In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling
939987 [36596] inspired by Dostoevsky: "He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and
939987 [36597] our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than
939987 [36598] we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart
939987 [36599] which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other
939987 [36600] gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he
939987 [36601] became great."

939987 [36612] PART I
939987 [36613] 
939987 [36614] 
939987 [36615] 
939987 [36616] CHAPTER I
939987 [36617] 
939987 [36618] On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of
939987 [36619] the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though
939987 [36620] in hesitation, towards K. bridge.
939987 [36621] 
939987 [36622] He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
939987 [36623] garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more
939987 [36624] like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,
939987 [36625] dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time
939987 [36626] he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
939987 [36627] invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a
939987 [36628] sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was
939987 [36629] hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
939987 [36630] 
939987 [36631] This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but
939987 [36632] for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,
939987 [36633] verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in
939987 [36634] himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not
939987 [36635] only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the
939987 [36636] anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had
939987 [36637] given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all
939987 [36638] desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror
939987 [36639] for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
939987 [36640] trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats
939987 [36641] and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to
939987 [36642] lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and
939987 [36643] slip out unseen.
939987 [36644] 
939987 [36645] This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
939987 [36646] aware of his fears.
939987 [36647] 
939987 [36648] "I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these
939987 [36649] trifles," he thought, with an odd smile. "Hm... yes, all is in a man's
939987 [36650] hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would
939987 [36651] be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new
939987 [36652] step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking
939987 [36653] too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is
939987 [36654] that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this
939987 [36655] last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the
939987 [36656] Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is
939987 [36657] _that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse
939987 [36658] myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything."
939987 [36659] 
939987 [36660] The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle
939987 [36661] and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that
939987 [36662] special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out
939987 [36663] of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's already
939987 [36664] overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which
939987 [36665] are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men
939987 [36666] whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed
939987 [36667] the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest
939987 [36668] disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face. He was,
939987 [36669] by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,
939987 [36670] well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank
939987 [36671] into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness
939987 [36672] of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
939987 [36673] to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the
939987 [36674] habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these
939987 [36675] moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a
939987 [36676] tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted
939987 [36677] food.
939987 [36678] 
939987 [36679] He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
939987 [36680] have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter
939987 [36681] of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have
939987 [36682] created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number
939987 [36683] of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading
939987 [36684] and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the
939987 [36685] heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets
939987 [36686] that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was
939987 [36687] such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that,
939987 [36688] in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least
939987 [36689] of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with
939987 [36690] acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked
939987 [36691] meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown
939987 [36692] reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy
939987 [36693] dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: "Hey there, German
939987 [36694] hatter" bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young
939987 [36695] man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall
939987 [36696] round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all
939987 [36697] torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly
939987 [36698] fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror
939987 [36699] had overtaken him.
939987 [36700] 
939987 [36701] "I knew it," he muttered in confusion, "I thought so! That's the worst
939987 [36702] of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might
939987 [36703] spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd
939987 [36704] and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any
939987 [36705] sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such
939987 [36706] a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What
939987 [36707] matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them
939987 [36708] a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as
939987 [36709] possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it's just such
939987 [36710] trifles that always ruin everything...."
939987 [36711] 
939987 [36712] He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
939987 [36713] of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted
939987 [36714] them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no
939987 [36715] faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous
939987 [36716] but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon
939987 [36717] them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at
939987 [36718] his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard
939987 [36719] this "hideous" dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he
939987 [36720] still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a
939987 [36721] "rehearsal" of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more
939987 [36722] and more violent.
939987 [36723] 
939987 [36724] With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house
939987 [36725] which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the
939987 [36726] street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
939987 [36727] working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of
939987 [36728] sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.
939987 [36729] There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
939987 [36730] two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on
939987 [36731] the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and
939987 [36732] at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the
939987 [36733] staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar
939987 [36734] with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:
939987 [36735] in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
939987 [36736] 
939987 [36737] "If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that
939987 [36738] I were really going to do it?" he could not help asking himself as he
939987 [36739] reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters
939987 [36740] who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the
939987 [36741] flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his
939987 [36742] family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this
939987 [36743] staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. "That's a good
939987 [36744] thing anyway," he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old
939987 [36745] woman's flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of
939987 [36746] tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells
939987 [36747] that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now
939987 [36748] its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it
939987 [36749] clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained
939987 [36750] by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old
939987 [36751] woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and
939987 [36752] nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.
939987 [36753] But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and
939987 [36754] opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which
939987 [36755] was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing
939987 [36756] him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,
939987 [36757] withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp
939987 [36758] little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared
939987 [36759] with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,
939987 [36760] which looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,
939987 [36761] and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy
939987 [36762] fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every
939987 [36763] instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
939987 [36764] expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.
939987 [36765] 
939987 [36766] "Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago," the young man made
939987 [36767] haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more
939987 [36768] polite.
939987 [36769] 
939987 [36770] "I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here," the
939987 [36771] old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.
939987 [36772] 
939987 [36773] "And here... I am again on the same errand," Raskolnikov continued, a
939987 [36774] little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust. "Perhaps
939987 [36775] she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other
939987 [36776] time," he thought with an uneasy feeling.
939987 [36777] 
939987 [36778] The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,
939987 [36779] and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass
939987 [36780] in front of her:
939987 [36781] 
939987 [36782] "Step in, my good sir."
939987 [36783] 
939987 [36784] The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on
939987 [36785] the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly
939987 [36786] lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.
939987 [36787] 
939987 [36788] "So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!" flashed as it were by
939987 [36789] chance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned
939987 [36790] everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and
939987 [36791] remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The
939987 [36792] furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with
939987 [36793] a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a
939987 [36794] dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,
939987 [36795] chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow
939987 [36796] frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was
939987 [36797] all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything
939987 [36798] was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;
939987 [36799] everything shone.
939987 [36800] 
939987 [36801] "Lizaveta's work," thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust
939987 [36802] to be seen in the whole flat.
939987 [36803] 
939987 [36804] "It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such
939987 [36805] cleanliness," Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance
939987 [36806] at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in
939987 [36807] which stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which he
939987 [36808] had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.
939987 [36809] 
939987 [36810] "What do you want?" the old woman said severely, coming into the room
939987 [36811] and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in
939987 [36812] the face.
939987 [36813] 
939987 [36814] "I've brought something to pawn here," and he drew out of his pocket
939987 [36815] an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a
939987 [36816] globe; the chain was of steel.
939987 [36817] 
939987 [36818] "But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day
939987 [36819] before yesterday."
939987 [36820] 
939987 [36821] "I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little."
939987 [36822] 
939987 [36823] "But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell
939987 [36824] your pledge at once."
939987 [36825] 
939987 [36826] "How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?"
939987 [36827] 
939987 [36828] "You come with such trifles, my good sir, it's scarcely worth anything.
939987 [36829] I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it
939987 [36830] quite new at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half."
939987 [36831] 
939987 [36832] "Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's. I
939987 [36833] shall be getting some money soon."
939987 [36834] 
939987 [36835] "A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!"
939987 [36836] 
939987 [36837] "A rouble and a half!" cried the young man.
939987 [36838] 
939987 [36839] "Please yourself"--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The
939987 [36840] young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going
939987 [36841] away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere
939987 [36842] else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.
939987 [36843] 
939987 [36844] "Hand it over," he said roughly.
939987 [36845] 
939987 [36846] The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind
939987 [36847] the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in
939987 [36848] the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear
939987 [36849] her unlocking the chest of drawers.
939987 [36850] 
939987 [36851] "It must be the top drawer," he reflected. "So she carries the keys in
939987 [36852] a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there's
939987 [36853] one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;
939987 [36854] that can't be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some
939987 [36855] other chest or strong-box... that's worth knowing. Strong-boxes always
939987 [36856] have keys like that... but how degrading it all is."
939987 [36857] 
939987 [36858] The old woman came back.
939987 [36859] 
939987 [36860] "Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take
939987 [36861] fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But
939987 [36862] for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks
939987 [36863] on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks
939987 [36864] altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the
939987 [36865] watch. Here it is."
939987 [36866] 
939987 [36867] "What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!"
939987 [36868] 
939987 [36869] "Just so."
939987 [36870] 
939987 [36871] The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the
939987 [36872] old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still
939987 [36873] something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know
939987 [36874] what.
939987 [36875] 
939987 [36876] "I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona
939987 [36877] Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it
939987 [36878] back from a friend..." he broke off in confusion.
939987 [36879] 
939987 [36880] "Well, we will talk about it then, sir."
939987 [36881] 
939987 [36882] "Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with
939987 [36883] you?" He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the
939987 [36884] passage.
939987 [36885] 
939987 [36886] "What business is she of yours, my good sir?"
939987 [36887] 
939987 [36888] "Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,
939987 [36889] Alyona Ivanovna."
939987 [36890] 
939987 [36891] Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more
939987 [36892] and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two
939987 [36893] or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was
939987 [36894] in the street he cried out, "Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and
939987 [36895] can I, can I possibly.... No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!" he added
939987 [36896] resolutely. "And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
939987 [36897] What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,
939987 [36898] disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been...."
939987 [36899] But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling
939987 [36900] of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart
939987 [36901] while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a
939987 [36902] pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to
939987 [36903] do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the
939987 [36904] pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling
939987 [36905] against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next
939987 [36906] street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern
939987 [36907] which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
939987 [36908] At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and
939987 [36909] supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to
939987 [36910] think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had
939987 [36911] never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a
939987 [36912] burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his
939987 [36913] sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little
939987 [36914] table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank
939987 [36915] off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became
939987 [36916] clear.
939987 [36917] 
939987 [36918] "All that's nonsense," he said hopefully, "and there is nothing in it
939987 [36919] all to worry about! It's simply physical derangement. Just a glass of
939987 [36920] beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,
939987 [36921] the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all
939987 [36922] is!"
939987 [36923] 
939987 [36924] But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful
939987 [36925] as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed
939987 [36926] round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that
939987 [36927] moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also
939987 [36928] not normal.
939987 [36929] 
939987 [36930] There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken
939987 [36931] men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and
939987 [36932] a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure
939987 [36933] left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern
939987 [36934] were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,
939987 [36935] sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with
939987 [36936] a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had
939987 [36937] dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in
939987 [36938] his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper
939987 [36939] part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some
939987 [36940] meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:
939987 [36941] 
939987 [36942]    "His wife a year he fondly loved
939987 [36943]     His wife a--a year he--fondly loved."
939987 [36944] 
939987 [36945] Or suddenly waking up again:
939987 [36946] 
939987 [36947]    "Walking along the crowded row
939987 [36948]     He met the one he used to know."
939987 [36949] 
939987 [36950] But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with
939987 [36951] positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was
939987 [36952] another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government
939987 [36953] clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and
939987 [36954] looking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.
939987 [36955] 
939987 [36956] 
939987 [36957] 
939987 [36958] CHAPTER II
939987 [36959] 
939987 [36960] Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided
939987 [36961] society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he
939987 [36962] felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking
939987 [36963] place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He
939987 [36964] was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
939987 [36965] excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other
939987 [36966] world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the
939987 [36967] surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
939987 [36968] 
939987 [36969] The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently
939987 [36970] came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with
939987 [36971] red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his
939987 [36972] person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,
939987 [36973] with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an
939987 [36974] iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was
939987 [36975] another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the
939987 [36976] counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and
939987 [36977] some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably
939987 [36978] close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such
939987 [36979] an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
939987 [36980] 
939987 [36981] There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the
939987 [36982] first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on
939987 [36983] Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked
939987 [36984] like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression
939987 [36985] afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly
939987 [36986] at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring
939987 [36987] persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At
939987 [36988] the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk
939987 [36989] looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing
939987 [36990] a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and
939987 [36991] culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to
939987 [36992] converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,
939987 [36993] and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of
939987 [36994] a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen
939987 [36995] reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very
939987 [36996] strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense
939987 [36997] feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the
939987 [36998] same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an
939987 [36999] old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing
939987 [37000] except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this
939987 [37001] last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots
939987 [37002] and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore
939987 [37003] no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin
939987 [37004] looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable
939987 [37005] and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he
939987 [37006] ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his
939987 [37007] hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky
939987 [37008] table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and
939987 [37009] resolutely:
939987 [37010] 
939987 [37011] "May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?
939987 [37012] Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my
939987 [37013] experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not
939987 [37014] accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in
939987 [37015] conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular
939987 [37016] counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I
939987 [37017] make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?"
939987 [37018] 
939987 [37019] "No, I am studying," answered the young man, somewhat surprised at
939987 [37020] the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly
939987 [37021] addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for
939987 [37022] company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his
939987 [37023] habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached
939987 [37024] or attempted to approach him.
939987 [37025] 
939987 [37026] "A student then, or formerly a student," cried the clerk. "Just what
939987 [37027] I thought! I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir," and he
939987 [37028] tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. "You've been a
939987 [37029] student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me...."
939987 [37030] He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside
939987 [37031] the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke
939987 [37032] fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his
939987 [37033] sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as
939987 [37034] greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.
939987 [37035] 
939987 [37036] "Honoured sir," he began almost with solemnity, "poverty is not a vice,
939987 [37037] that's a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,
939987 [37038] and that that's even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a
939987 [37039] vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but
939987 [37040] in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human
939987 [37041] society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as
939987 [37042] humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary
939987 [37043] I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!
939987 [37044] Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and
939987 [37045] my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me
939987 [37046] to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent
939987 [37047] a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?"
939987 [37048] 
939987 [37049] "No, I have not happened to," answered Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"
939987 [37050] 
939987 [37051] "Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've slept
939987 [37052] so...." He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in
939987 [37053] fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite
939987 [37054] probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
939987 [37055] His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black
939987 [37056] nails.
939987 [37057] 
939987 [37058] His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The
939987 [37059] boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the
939987 [37060] upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the "funny fellow"
939987 [37061] and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.
939987 [37062] Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most
939987 [37063] likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of
939987 [37064] frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in
939987 [37065] the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and
939987 [37066] especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order
939987 [37067] at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify
939987 [37068] themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
939987 [37069] 
939987 [37070] "Funny fellow!" pronounced the innkeeper. "And why don't you work, why
939987 [37071] aren't you at your duty, if you are in the service?"
939987 [37072] 
939987 [37073] "Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir," Marmeladov went on, addressing
939987 [37074] himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put
939987 [37075] that question to him. "Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache
939987 [37076] to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov
939987 [37077] beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer?
939987 [37078] Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to
939987 [37079] petition hopelessly for a loan?"
939987 [37080] 
939987 [37081] "Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?"
939987 [37082] 
939987 [37083] "Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you
939987 [37084] will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive
939987 [37085] certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will
939987 [37086] on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?
939987 [37087] For he knows of course that I shan't pay it back. From compassion? But
939987 [37088] Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day
939987 [37089] that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that's
939987 [37090] what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I
939987 [37091] ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that
939987 [37092] he won't, I set off to him and..."
939987 [37093] 
939987 [37094] "Why do you go?" put in Raskolnikov.
939987 [37095] 
939987 [37096] "Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must
939987 [37097] have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must
939987 [37098] go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,
939987 [37099] then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport)," he added
939987 [37100] in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.
939987 [37101] "No matter, sir, no matter!" he went on hurriedly and with apparent
939987 [37102] composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the
939987 [37103] innkeeper smiled--"No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of
939987 [37104] their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all
939987 [37105] that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but
939987 [37106] with humility. So be it! So be it! 'Behold the man!' Excuse me, young
939987 [37107] man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not
939987 [37108] _can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?"
939987 [37109] 
939987 [37110] The young man did not answer a word.
939987 [37111] 
939987 [37112] "Well," the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,
939987 [37113] after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. "Well, so be
939987 [37114] it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but
939987 [37115] Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer's
939987 [37116] daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a
939987 [37117] noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,
939987 [37118] if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man
939987 [37119] ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina
939987 [37120] Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although
939987 [37121] I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for
939987 [37122] I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," he
939987 [37123] declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--"but, my
939987 [37124] God, if she would but once.... But no, no! It's all in vain and it's no
939987 [37125] use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true
939987 [37126] and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a
939987 [37127] beast by nature!"
939987 [37128] 
939987 [37129] "Rather!" assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist
939987 [37130] resolutely on the table.
939987 [37131] 
939987 [37132] "Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very
939987 [37133] stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the
939987 [37134] order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!
939987 [37135] Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own
939987 [37136] property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this
939987 [37137] winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three
939987 [37138] little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till
939987 [37139] night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she's
939987 [37140] been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has
939987 [37141] a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don't feel it?
939987 [37142] And the more I drink the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try
939987 [37143] to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer
939987 [37144] twice as much!" And as though in despair he laid his head down on the
939987 [37145] table.
939987 [37146] 
939987 [37147] "Young man," he went on, raising his head again, "in your face I seem to
939987 [37148] read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why
939987 [37149] I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I
939987 [37150] do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,
939987 [37151] who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man
939987 [37152] of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a
939987 [37153] high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she
939987 [37154] danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for
939987 [37155] which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
939987 [37156] The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the
939987 [37157] certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed
939987 [37158] it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms
939987 [37159] with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past
939987 [37160] honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don't condemn her for
939987 [37161] it, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of
939987 [37162] the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady
939987 [37163] of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has
939987 [37164] nothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treated
939987 [37165] with disrespect. That's why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov's
939987 [37166] rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to
939987 [37167] her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was
939987 [37168] a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the
939987 [37169] other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and
939987 [37170] ran away with him from her father's house. She was exceedingly fond of
939987 [37171] her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he
939987 [37172] died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of
939987 [37173] which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of
939987 [37174] him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad
939987 [37175] that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having
939987 [37176] once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in
939987 [37177] a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she
939987 [37178] was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups
939987 [37179] and downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even. Her
939987 [37180] relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively
939987 [37181] proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a
939987 [37182] widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered
939987 [37183] her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can
939987 [37184] judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education
939987 [37185] and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my
939987 [37186] wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she
939987 [37187] married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you
939987 [37188] understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,
939987 [37189] that you don't understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed
939987 [37190] my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this" (he
939987 [37191] tapped the jug with his finger), "for I have feelings. But even so, I
939987 [37192] could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no
939987 [37193] fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch
939987 [37194] it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at
939987 [37195] last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent
939987 [37196] capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a
939987 [37197] situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This
939987 [37198] time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come
939987 [37199] out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's;
939987 [37200] and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.
939987 [37201] There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and
939987 [37202] disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by
939987 [37203] my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with
939987 [37204] from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won't speak of. For,
939987 [37205] though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited
939987 [37206] lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it's no use going over
939987 [37207] that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an
939987 [37208] effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal
939987 [37209] history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we
939987 [37210] had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not
939987 [37211] even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at
939987 [37212] Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read
939987 [37213] other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great
939987 [37214] interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology--do
939987 [37215] you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's the
939987 [37216] whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured
939987 [37217] sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that
939987 [37218] a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen
939987 [37219] farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special
939987 [37220] talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what's
939987 [37221] more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of
939987 [37222] him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she
939987 [37223] made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the
939987 [37224] pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were
939987 [37225] put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina
939987 [37226] Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed
939987 [37227] red, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' says
939987 [37228] she, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.'
939987 [37229] And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the
939987 [37230] little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of
939987 [37231] it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle
939987 [37232] creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin
939987 [37233] little face). She said: 'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing
939987 [37234] like that?' And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very
939987 [37235] well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her
939987 [37236] through the landlady. 'And why not?' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,
939987 [37237] 'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!' But don't blame
939987 [37238] her, don't blame her, honoured sir, don't blame her! She was not herself
939987 [37239] when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying
939987 [37240] of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything
939987 [37241] else.... For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when children
939987 [37242] cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o'clock
939987 [37243] I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the
939987 [37244] room and about nine o'clock she came back. She walked straight up to
939987 [37245] Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her
939987 [37246] in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she
939987 [37247] simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,
939987 [37248] made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down
939987 [37249] on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
939987 [37250] body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....
939987 [37251] And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence
939987 [37252] go up to Sonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
939987 [37253] kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell
939987 [37254] asleep in each other's arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay
939987 [37255] drunk."
939987 [37256] 
939987 [37257] Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he
939987 [37258] hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.
939987 [37259] 
939987 [37260] "Since then, sir," he went on after a brief pause--"Since then, owing
939987 [37261] to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by
939987 [37262] evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a
939987 [37263] leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of
939987 [37264] respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take
939987 [37265] a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with
939987 [37266] us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though
939987 [37267] she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
939987 [37268] hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia's
939987 [37269] account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of
939987 [37270] a sudden he stood on his dignity: 'how,' said he, 'can a highly educated
939987 [37271] man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?' And Katerina
939987 [37272] Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that's
939987 [37273] how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she
939987 [37274] comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room
939987 [37275] at the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is
939987 [37276] a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft
939987 [37277] palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one
939987 [37278] room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor
939987 [37279] people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,
939987 [37280] and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his
939987 [37281] excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you
939987 [37282] know him? No? Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know. He is wax...
939987 [37283] wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were
939987 [37284] dim when he heard my story. 'Marmeladov, once already you have
939987 [37285] deceived my expectations... I'll take you once more on my own
939987 [37286] responsibility'--that's what he said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now you
939987 [37287] can go.' I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality
939987 [37288] he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of
939987 [37289] modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I
939987 [37290] announced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive a
939987 [37291] salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!..."
939987 [37292] 
939987 [37293] Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole
939987 [37294] party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds
939987 [37295] of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven
939987 [37296] singing "The Hamlet" were heard in the entry. The room was filled with
939987 [37297] noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
939987 [37298] Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
939987 [37299] He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more
939987 [37300] drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his
939987 [37301] recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was
939987 [37302] positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov
939987 [37303] listened attentively.
939987 [37304] 
939987 [37305] "That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [37306] and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the
939987 [37307] kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but
939987 [37308] abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. 'Semyon
939987 [37309] Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!'
939987 [37310] They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They
939987 [37311] began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed
939987 [37312] to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty
939987 [37313] copecks, I can't guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,
939987 [37314] a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and
939987 [37315] a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
939987 [37316] Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with
939987 [37317] horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any
939987 [37318] dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going
939987 [37319] on a visit; and not that she'd anything to do it with, she smartened
939987 [37320] herself up with nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on a
939987 [37321] clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different
939987 [37322] person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,
939987 [37323] had only helped with money 'for the time,' she said, 'it won't do for me
939987 [37324] to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.' Do
939987 [37325] you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you
939987 [37326] think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with
939987 [37327] our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not
939987 [37328] resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,
939987 [37329] whispering together. 'Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,
939987 [37330] now, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he went himself to his
939987 [37331] excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the
939987 [37332] others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into
939987 [37333] his study.' Do you hear, do you hear? 'To be sure,' says he, 'Semyon
939987 [37334] Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spite
939987 [37335] of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and
939987 [37336] since moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do you
939987 [37337] hear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.' And
939987 [37338] all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not
939987 [37339] simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it
939987 [37340] all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she
939987 [37341] does! And I don't blame her for it, no, I don't blame her!... Six days
939987 [37342] ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles
939987 [37343] forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: 'poppet,' said she,
939987 [37344] 'my little poppet.' And when we were by ourselves, you understand?
939987 [37345] You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a
939987 [37346] husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, 'my little poppet,'
939987 [37347] said she."
939987 [37348] 
939987 [37349] Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began
939987 [37350] to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded
939987 [37351] appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of
939987 [37352] spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered
939987 [37353] his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
939987 [37354] He felt vexed that he had come here.
939987 [37355] 
939987 [37356] "Honoured sir, honoured sir," cried Marmeladov recovering himself--"Oh,
939987 [37357] sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to
939987 [37358] others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
939987 [37359] trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
939987 [37360] For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
939987 [37361] and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
939987 [37362] arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should
939987 [37363] give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour
939987 [37364] and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....
939987 [37365] Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir" (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort
939987 [37366] of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) "well, on
939987 [37367] the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five
939987 [37368] days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,
939987 [37369] I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was
939987 [37370] left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look
939987 [37371] at me, all of you! It's the fifth day since I left home, and they are
939987 [37372] looking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniform
939987 [37373] is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the
939987 [37374] garments I have on... and it's the end of everything!"
939987 [37375] 
939987 [37376] Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed
939987 [37377] his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute
939987 [37378] later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
939987 [37379] affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:
939987 [37380] 
939987 [37381] "This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!
939987 [37382] He-he-he!"
939987 [37383] 
939987 [37384] "You don't say she gave it to you?" cried one of the new-comers; he
939987 [37385] shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
939987 [37386] 
939987 [37387] "This very quart was bought with her money," Marmeladov declared,
939987 [37388] addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. "Thirty copecks she gave
939987 [37389] me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said
939987 [37390] nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up
939987 [37391] yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them,
939987 [37392] they don't blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don't
939987 [37393] blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do
939987 [37394] you think, my dear sir? For now she's got to keep up her appearance. It
939987 [37395] costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you
939987 [37396] understand? And there's pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;
939987 [37397] petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her
939987 [37398] foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you
939987 [37399] understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,
939987 [37400] here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking
939987 [37401] it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like
939987 [37402] me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry
939987 [37403] or not? He-he-he!"
939987 [37404] 
939987 [37405] He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was
939987 [37406] empty.
939987 [37407] 
939987 [37408] "What are you to be pitied for?" shouted the tavern-keeper who was again
939987 [37409] near them.
939987 [37410] 
939987 [37411] Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths
939987 [37412] came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
939987 [37413] nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged
939987 [37414] government clerk.
939987 [37415] 
939987 [37416] "To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?" Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,
939987 [37417] standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only
939987 [37418] waiting for that question.
939987 [37419] 
939987 [37420] "Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there's nothing to pity me for! I
939987 [37421] ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,
939987 [37422] oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be
939987 [37423] crucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...
939987 [37424] Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been
939987 [37425] sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and
939987 [37426] tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity
939987 [37427] us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all
939987 [37428] things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day
939987 [37429] and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,
939987 [37430] consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is
939987 [37431] the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,
939987 [37432] undismayed by his beastliness?' And He will say, 'Come to me! I have
939987 [37433] already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins
939987 [37434] which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....' And he
939987 [37435] will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my
939987 [37436] heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive
939987 [37437] all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has
939987 [37438] done with all of them, then He will summon us. 'You too come forth,'
939987 [37439] He will say, 'Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come
939987 [37440] forth, ye children of shame!' And we shall all come forth, without shame
939987 [37441] and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, made
939987 [37442] in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!' And the
939987 [37443] wise ones and those of understanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thou
939987 [37444] receive these men?' And He will say, 'This is why I receive them, oh ye
939987 [37445] wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one
939987 [37446] of them believed himself to be worthy of this.' And He will hold out His
939987 [37447] hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...
939987 [37448] and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and
939987 [37449] all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....
939987 [37450] Lord, Thy kingdom come!" And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and
939987 [37451] helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings
939987 [37452] and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;
939987 [37453] there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard
939987 [37454] again.
939987 [37455] 
939987 [37456] "That's his notion!"
939987 [37457] 
939987 [37458] "Talked himself silly!"
939987 [37459] 
939987 [37460] "A fine clerk he is!"
939987 [37461] 
939987 [37462] And so on, and so on.
939987 [37463] 
939987 [37464] "Let us go, sir," said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and
939987 [37465] addressing Raskolnikov--"come along with me... Kozel's house, looking
939987 [37466] into the yard. I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did."
939987 [37467] 
939987 [37468] Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to
939987 [37469] help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech
939987 [37470] and leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred
939987 [37471] paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and
939987 [37472] confusion as they drew nearer the house.
939987 [37473] 
939987 [37474] "It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he muttered in
939987 [37475] agitation--"and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair
939987 [37476] matter! Bother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will be better if
939987 [37477] she does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of... it's her
939987 [37478] eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,
939987 [37479] frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people
939987 [37480] in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of
939987 [37481] the children's crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...
939987 [37482] I don't know what's happened! I don't know! But blows I am not afraid
939987 [37483] of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an
939987 [37484] enjoyment. In fact I can't get on without it.... It's better so. Let
939987 [37485] her strike me, it relieves her heart... it's better so... There is the
939987 [37486] house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.
939987 [37487] Lead the way!"
939987 [37488] 
939987 [37489] They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase
939987 [37490] got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o'clock
939987 [37491] and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was
939987 [37492] quite dark at the top of the stairs.
939987 [37493] 
939987 [37494] A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very
939987 [37495] poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;
939987 [37496] the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,
939987 [37497] littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments.
939987 [37498] Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it
939987 [37499] probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs
939987 [37500] and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which
939987 [37501] stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge
939987 [37502] of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It
939987 [37503] appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,
939987 [37504] but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other
939987 [37505] rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat was
939987 [37506] divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter
939987 [37507] within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words
939987 [37508] of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
939987 [37509] 
939987 [37510] Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,
939987 [37511] slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
939987 [37512] hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down
939987 [37513] in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
939987 [37514] were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes
939987 [37515] glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And
939987 [37516] that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
939987 [37517] candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to
939987 [37518] Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
939987 [37519] Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.
939987 [37520] She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room
939987 [37521] was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
939987 [37522] staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner
939987 [37523] rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not
939987 [37524] close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting
939987 [37525] curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older
939987 [37526] stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a
939987 [37527] beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,
939987 [37528] wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung
939987 [37529] over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.
939987 [37530] Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother's neck. She was
939987 [37531] trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she
939987 [37532] could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large
939987 [37533] dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened
939987 [37534] face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the
939987 [37535] door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov
939987 [37536] in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently
939987 [37537] facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what
939987 [37538] he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into
939987 [37539] the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no
939987 [37540] further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it
939987 [37541] and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the
939987 [37542] doorway.
939987 [37543] 
939987 [37544] "Ah!" she cried out in a frenzy, "he has come back! The criminal! the
939987 [37545] monster!... And where is the money? What's in your pocket, show me! And
939987 [37546] your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the
939987 [37547] money! Speak!"
939987 [37548] 
939987 [37549] And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently
939987 [37550] held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.
939987 [37551] 
939987 [37552] "Where is the money?" she cried--"Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?
939987 [37553] There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!" and in a fury
939987 [37554] she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov
939987 [37555] seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
939987 [37556] 
939987 [37557] "And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a
939987 [37558] positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir," he called out, shaken to and
939987 [37559] fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.
939987 [37560] The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the
939987 [37561] corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed
939987 [37562] to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was
939987 [37563] shaking like a leaf.
939987 [37564] 
939987 [37565] "He's drunk it! he's drunk it all," the poor woman screamed in
939987 [37566] despair--"and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!"--and
939987 [37567] wringing her hands she pointed to the children. "Oh, accursed life!
939987 [37568] And you, are you not ashamed?"--she pounced all at once upon
939987 [37569] Raskolnikov--"from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have
939987 [37570] been drinking with him, too! Go away!"
939987 [37571] 
939987 [37572] The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door
939987 [37573] was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse
939987 [37574] laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
939987 [37575] themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in
939987 [37576] dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of
939987 [37577] them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when
939987 [37578] Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation
939987 [37579] to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill
939987 [37580] outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her
939987 [37581] way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and
939987 [37582] for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her
939987 [37583] with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,
939987 [37584] Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the
939987 [37585] coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to
939987 [37586] lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed
939987 [37587] his mind and would have gone back.
939987 [37588] 
939987 [37589] "What a stupid thing I've done," he thought to himself, "they have Sonia
939987 [37590] and I want it myself." But reflecting that it would be impossible to
939987 [37591] take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he
939987 [37592] dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.
939987 [37593] "Sonia wants pomatum too," he said as he walked along the street, and he
939987 [37594] laughed malignantly--"such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia
939987 [37595] herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting
939987 [37596] big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
939987 [37597] to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they've dug
939987 [37598] there! And they're making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most
939987 [37599] of it! They've wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to
939987 [37600] everything, the scoundrel!"
939987 [37601] 
939987 [37602] He sank into thought.
939987 [37603] 
939987 [37604] "And what if I am wrong," he cried suddenly after a moment's thought.
939987 [37605] "What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the
939987 [37606] whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial
939987 [37607] terrors and there are no barriers and it's all as it should be."
939987 [37608]

939987 [37611] CHAPTER III
939987 [37612] 
939987 [37613] He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not
939987 [37614] refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked
939987 [37615] with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six
939987 [37616] paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty
939987 [37617] yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man
939987 [37618] of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment
939987 [37619] that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in
939987 [37620] keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a
939987 [37621] painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;
939987 [37622] the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long
939987 [37623] untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and
939987 [37624] half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but
939987 [37625] was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep
939987 [37626] on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old
939987 [37627] student's overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he
939987 [37628] heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A
939987 [37629] little table stood in front of the sofa.
939987 [37630] 
939987 [37631] It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to
939987 [37632] Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.
939987 [37633] He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,
939987 [37634] and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked
939987 [37635] sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was
939987 [37636] in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated
939987 [37637] upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending
939987 [37638] him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,
939987 [37639] though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,
939987 [37640] was rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given up
939987 [37641] sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into
939987 [37642] his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.
939987 [37643] 
939987 [37644] "Get up, why are you asleep?" she called to him. "It's past nine, I have
939987 [37645] brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you're fairly
939987 [37646] starving?"
939987 [37647] 
939987 [37648] Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.
939987 [37649] 
939987 [37650] "From the landlady, eh?" he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting
939987 [37651] up on the sofa.
939987 [37652] 
939987 [37653] "From the landlady, indeed!"
939987 [37654] 
939987 [37655] She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and
939987 [37656] laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.
939987 [37657] 
939987 [37658] "Here, Nastasya, take it please," he said, fumbling in his pocket (for
939987 [37659] he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--"run
939987 [37660] and buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the
939987 [37661] pork-butcher's."
939987 [37662] 
939987 [37663] "The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather have
939987 [37664] some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It's capital soup, yesterday's. I
939987 [37665] saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It's fine soup."
939987 [37666] 
939987 [37667] When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya
939987 [37668] sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country
939987 [37669] peasant-woman and a very talkative one.
939987 [37670] 
939987 [37671] "Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you," she
939987 [37672] said.
939987 [37673] 
939987 [37674] He scowled.
939987 [37675] 
939987 [37676] "To the police? What does she want?"
939987 [37677] 
939987 [37678] "You don't pay her money and you won't turn out of the room. That's what
939987 [37679] she wants, to be sure."
939987 [37680] 
939987 [37681] "The devil, that's the last straw," he muttered, grinding his teeth,
939987 [37682] "no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool," he added aloud.
939987 [37683] "I'll go and talk to her to-day."
939987 [37684] 
939987 [37685] "Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so
939987 [37686] clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One
939987 [37687] time you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you
939987 [37688] do nothing now?"
939987 [37689] 
939987 [37690] "I am doing..." Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.
939987 [37691] 
939987 [37692] "What are you doing?"
939987 [37693] 
939987 [37694] "Work..."
939987 [37695] 
939987 [37696] "What sort of work?"
939987 [37697] 
939987 [37698] "I am thinking," he answered seriously after a pause.
939987 [37699] 
939987 [37700] Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter
939987 [37701] and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and
939987 [37702] shaking all over till she felt ill.
939987 [37703] 
939987 [37704] "And have you made much money by your thinking?" she managed to
939987 [37705] articulate at last.
939987 [37706] 
939987 [37707] "One can't go out to give lessons without boots. And I'm sick of it."
939987 [37708] 
939987 [37709] "Don't quarrel with your bread and butter."
939987 [37710] 
939987 [37711] "They pay so little for lessons. What's the use of a few coppers?" he
939987 [37712] answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.
939987 [37713] 
939987 [37714] "And you want to get a fortune all at once?"
939987 [37715] 
939987 [37716] He looked at her strangely.
939987 [37717] 
939987 [37718] "Yes, I want a fortune," he answered firmly, after a brief pause.
939987 [37719] 
939987 [37720] "Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the
939987 [37721] loaf or not?"
939987 [37722] 
939987 [37723] "As you please."
939987 [37724] 
939987 [37725] "Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out."
939987 [37726] 
939987 [37727] "A letter? for me! from whom?"
939987 [37728] 
939987 [37729] "I can't say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will
939987 [37730] you pay me back?"
939987 [37731] 
939987 [37732] "Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it," cried Raskolnikov
939987 [37733] greatly excited--"good God!"
939987 [37734] 
939987 [37735] A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,
939987 [37736] from the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a
939987 [37737] long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also
939987 [37738] suddenly stabbed his heart.
939987 [37739] 
939987 [37740] "Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your three
939987 [37741] copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go!"
939987 [37742] 
939987 [37743] The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her
939987 [37744] presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya
939987 [37745] had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he
939987 [37746] gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear
939987 [37747] and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.
939987 [37748] He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;
939987 [37749] it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets
939987 [37750] of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
939987 [37751] 
939987 [37752] "My dear Rodya," wrote his mother--"it's two months since I last had a
939987 [37753] talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me
939987 [37754] awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my
939987 [37755] inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look
939987 [37756] to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a
939987 [37757] grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university
939987 [37758] some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had
939987 [37759] lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my
939987 [37760] hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent
939987 [37761] you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,
939987 [37762] from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a
939987 [37763] kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too. But having given
939987 [37764] him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was
939987 [37765] paid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to send
939987 [37766] you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall
939987 [37767] be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate
939987 [37768] ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In
939987 [37769] the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister
939987 [37770] has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be
939987 [37771] separated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will
939987 [37772] tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything
939987 [37773] has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you
939987 [37774] wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great
939987 [37775] deal to put up with in the SvidrigraÃ¯lovs' house, when you wrote that
939987 [37776] and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to
939987 [37777] you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have
939987 [37778] thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all
939987 [37779] the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not
939987 [37780] let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I
939987 [37781] do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What
939987 [37782] made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles
939987 [37783] in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on
939987 [37784] condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it
939987 [37785] was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
939987 [37786] This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took
939987 [37787] chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly
939987 [37788] then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,
939987 [37789] writing that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was not
939987 [37790] so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have
939987 [37791] suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves
939987 [37792] you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated
939987 [37793] her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at
939987 [37794] table.... But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so as
939987 [37795] not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite
939987 [37796] of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov's
939987 [37797] wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,
939987 [37798] especially when Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, relapsing into his old regimental
939987 [37799] habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it
939987 [37800] was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had
939987 [37801] conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed
939987 [37802] it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and
939987 [37803] horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and
939987 [37804] his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.
939987 [37805] And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide
939987 [37806] the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face
939987 [37807] to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of
939987 [37808] inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her
939987 [37809] to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went
939987 [37810] through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on
939987 [37811] account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa
939987 [37812] Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia
939987 [37813] would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would
939987 [37814] have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been
939987 [37815] inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could
939987 [37816] not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know
939987 [37817] Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
939987 [37818] has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases
939987 [37819] she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write
939987 [37820] to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were
939987 [37821] constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa
939987 [37822] Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the
939987 [37823] garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw
939987 [37824] the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful
939987 [37825] scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna
939987 [37826] went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was
939987 [37827] shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should
939987 [37828] be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which they
939987 [37829] flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without
939987 [37830] folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,
939987 [37831] and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an
939987 [37832] open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer
939987 [37833] could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and
939987 [37834] what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to
939987 [37835] you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified
939987 [37836] and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin
939987 [37837] yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter
939987 [37838] with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a
939987 [37839] whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came
939987 [37840] to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account
939987 [37841] of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about
939987 [37842] us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the
939987 [37843] street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to
939987 [37844] insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,
939987 [37845] so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set
939987 [37846] going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at
939987 [37847] her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that
939987 [37848] month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is
939987 [37849] rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and
939987 [37850] particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not
939987 [37851] at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in
939987 [37852] the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but
939987 [37853] Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how
939987 [37854] she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is
939987 [37855] an angel! But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.
939987 [37856] SvidrigaÃ¯lov returned to his senses and repented and, probably
939987 [37857] feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and
939987 [37858] unmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia
939987 [37859] had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna
939987 [37860] came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.
939987 [37861] SvidrigaÃ¯lov's hands after her departure, she had written to refuse
939987 [37862] personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating
939987 [37863] her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation
939987 [37864] for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding
939987 [37865] him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how
939987 [37866] infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,
939987 [37867] unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and
939987 [37868] touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot
939987 [37869] read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,
939987 [37870] cleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more
939987 [37871] than Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case
939987 [37872] with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and 'again
939987 [37873] crushed' as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of
939987 [37874] Dounia's innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight
939987 [37875] to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give
939987 [37876] her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she
939987 [37877] came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept
939987 [37878] bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to
939987 [37879] forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all
939987 [37880] the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in
939987 [37881] the most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility of
939987 [37882] her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to
939987 [37883] everyone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov and
939987 [37884] even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was
939987 [37885] superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about
939987 [37886] the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence
939987 [37887] having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so
939987 [37888] that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone
939987 [37889] knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the
939987 [37890] letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading
939987 [37891] of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their
939987 [37892] own houses and in other people's. In my opinion a great deal, a very
939987 [37893] great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's
939987 [37894] character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's
939987 [37895] reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible
939987 [37896] disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really
939987 [37897] began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too
939987 [37898] harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,
939987 [37899] but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked
939987 [37900] respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may
939987 [37901] say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,
939987 [37902] that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry
939987 [37903] him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been
939987 [37904] arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved
939987 [37905] with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we
939987 [37906] could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you
939987 [37907] could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This
939987 [37908] was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr
939987 [37909] Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who
939987 [37910] has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his
939987 [37911] expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was
939987 [37912] properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent
939987 [37913] us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a
939987 [37914] speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry
939987 [37915] to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,
939987 [37916] of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly
939987 [37917] and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a
939987 [37918] well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government
939987 [37919] and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years
939987 [37920] old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be
939987 [37921] thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and
939987 [37922] presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
939987 [37923] But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
939987 [37924] And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will
939987 [37925] do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if
939987 [37926] there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this
939987 [37927] warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression
939987 [37928] upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be
939987 [37929] deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,
939987 [37930] which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr
939987 [37931] Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.
939987 [37932] At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but
939987 [37933] still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions 'of our
939987 [37934] most rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He
939987 [37935] said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be
939987 [37936] listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very
939987 [37937] little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man
939987 [37938] of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know
939987 [37939] your sister's character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and
939987 [37940] generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.
939987 [37941] Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but
939987 [37942] Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make
939987 [37943] it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her
939987 [37944] happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it
939987 [37945] must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he
939987 [37946] is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that
939987 [37947] his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with
939987 [37948] him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even
939987 [37949] certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in
939987 [37950] the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she
939987 [37951] relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and
939987 [37952] that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future
939987 [37953] relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,
939987 [37954] for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come
939987 [37955] from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For
939987 [37956] instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent,
939987 [37957] in the course of conversation, he declared that before making
939987 [37958] Dounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of
939987 [37959] good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced
939987 [37960] poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his
939987 [37961] wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
939987 [37962] benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely
939987 [37963] than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only
939987 [37964] remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,
939987 [37965] but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards
939987 [37966] to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike
939987 [37967] me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was
939987 [37968] vexed, and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is
939987 [37969] perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up
939987 [37970] her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was
939987 [37971] walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before
939987 [37972] the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me
939987 [37973] that she had decided.
939987 [37974] 
939987 [37975] "I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for
939987 [37976] Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open
939987 [37977] a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil
939987 [37978] and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important
939987 [37979] case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before
939987 [37980] the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in
939987 [37981] every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day
939987 [37982] you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that
939987 [37983] your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to
939987 [37984] pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a
939987 [37985] providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even
939987 [37986] ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.
939987 [37987] He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not
939987 [37988] get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to
939987 [37989] a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the
939987 [37990] duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then
939987 [37991] he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave
939987 [37992] you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but
939987 [37993] Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever
939987 [37994] for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for
939987 [37995] your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr
939987 [37996] Petrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a
939987 [37997] student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share
939987 [37998] all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of
939987 [37999] realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very
939987 [38000] natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly
939987 [38001] persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her
939987 [38002] future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful
939987 [38003] not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,
939987 [38004] especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might
939987 [38005] take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor
939987 [38006] has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
939987 [38007] of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
939987 [38008] of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,
939987 [38009] later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
939987 [38010] himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
939987 [38011] you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and
939987 [38012] receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your
939987 [38013] own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree
939987 [38014] with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that
939987 [38015] is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when
939987 [38016] you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about
939987 [38017] you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing
939987 [38018] him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own
939987 [38019] opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious
939987 [38020] Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr
939987 [38021] Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,
939987 [38022] fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with
939987 [38023] them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and
939987 [38024] delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter
939987 [38025] for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is
939987 [38026] simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have
939987 [38027] noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with
939987 [38028] their mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's
939987 [38029] way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so
939987 [38030] long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and
939987 [38031] Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most
939987 [38032] joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:
939987 [38033] know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a
939987 [38034] very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of
939987 [38035] almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to
939987 [38036] set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon,
939987 [38037] possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us
939987 [38038] know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his
939987 [38039] own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,
939987 [38040] even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is
939987 [38041] too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall
939987 [38042] press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought
939987 [38043] of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry
939987 [38044] Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing
939987 [38045] anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,
939987 [38046] so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for
939987 [38047] a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting
939987 [38048] herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But
939987 [38049] although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much
939987 [38050] money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia
939987 [38051] is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know
939987 [38052] that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles
939987 [38053] on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send
939987 [38054] you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am
939987 [38055] uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has
939987 [38056] been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that
939987 [38057] is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big
939987 [38058] trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we
939987 [38059] must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we
939987 [38060] can't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But
939987 [38061] we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see
939987 [38062] that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from
939987 [38063] us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we
939987 [38064] know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel
939987 [38065] quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send
939987 [38066] to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered
939987 [38067] two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole
939987 [38068] history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,
939987 [38069] I embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet. Love Dounia
939987 [38070] your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she
939987 [38071] loves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,
939987 [38072] Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If
939987 [38073] only you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,
939987 [38074] Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am
939987 [38075] afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of
939987 [38076] infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,
939987 [38077] dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used
939987 [38078] to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those
939987 [38079] days. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with
939987 [38080] many kisses.
939987 [38081] 
939987 [38082] "Yours till death,
939987 [38083] 
939987 [38084] "PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV."
939987 [38085] 
939987 [38086] 
939987 [38087] Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov's face was
939987 [38088] wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted
939987 [38089] and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his
939987 [38090] head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long
939987 [38091] time. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.
939987 [38092] At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was
939987 [38093] like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He
939987 [38094] took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting
939987 [38095] anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the
939987 [38096] Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though
939987 [38097] hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without
939987 [38098] noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the
939987 [38099] astonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.
939987 [38100] 
939987 [38101] 
939987 [38102] 
939987 [38103] CHAPTER IV
939987 [38104] 
939987 [38105] His mother's letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief
939987 [38106] fact in it, he had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he was
939987 [38107] reading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably
939987 [38108] settled, in his mind: "Never such a marriage while I am alive and
939987 [38109] Mr. Luzhin be damned!" "The thing is perfectly clear," he muttered
939987 [38110] to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his
939987 [38111] decision. "No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! and then they
939987 [38112] apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without
939987 [38113] me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can't be broken
939987 [38114] off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:
939987 [38115] 'Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in
939987 [38116] post-haste, almost by express.' No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what
939987 [38117] you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when
939987 [38118] you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before
939987 [38119] the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom. Bitter is
939987 [38120] the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have
939987 [38121] determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one
939987 [38122] who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much
939987 [38123] more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who
939987 [38124] shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and
939987 [38125] who _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats
939987 [38126] everything! And that very Dounia for that very '_seems_' is marrying
939987 [38127] him! Splendid! splendid!
939987 [38128] 
939987 [38129] "... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our
939987 [38130] most rising generation'? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea
939987 [38131] of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!
939987 [38132] I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one
939987 [38133] another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into
939987 [38134] _words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart
939987 [38135] and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and
939987 [38136] better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from
939987 [38137] mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and
939987 [38138] mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was
939987 [38139] sure to be vexed and 'answered her angrily.' I should think so! Who
939987 [38140] would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naÃ¯ve questions
939987 [38141] and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why
939987 [38142] does she write to me, 'love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than
939987 [38143] herself'? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter
939987 [38144] to her son? 'You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh,
939987 [38145] mother!"
939987 [38146] 
939987 [38147] His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to
939987 [38148] meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.
939987 [38149] 
939987 [38150] "Hm... yes, that's true," he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that
939987 [38151] chased each other in his brain, "it is true that 'it needs time and care
939987 [38152] to get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The
939987 [38153] chief thing is he is 'a man of business and _seems_ kind,' that was
939987 [38154] something, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,
939987 [38155] no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a
939987 [38156] peasant's cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in
939987 [38157] it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel very
939987 [38158] comfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One
939987 [38159] must cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr.
939987 [38160] Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has
939987 [38161] to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it's a matter
939987 [38162] of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and
939987 [38163] expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The
939987 [38164] business man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less
939987 [38165] than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they
939987 [38166] don't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see? And
939987 [38167] they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first
939987 [38168] blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really
939987 [38169] matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_
939987 [38170] of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it's a
939987 [38171] foretaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will
939987 [38172] she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or
939987 [38173] two 'paper ones' as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does
939987 [38174] she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons
939987 [38175] already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the
939987 [38176] marriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let
939987 [38177] slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'I
939987 [38178] shall refuse,' says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting
939987 [38179] on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when
939987 [38180] Afanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and
939987 [38181] embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don't add
939987 [38182] more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know
939987 [38183] that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin's
939987 [38184] generosity; 'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.'
939987 [38185] You may wait a long time for that! That's how it always is with these
939987 [38186] Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan
939987 [38187] with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see
939987 [38188] nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of
939987 [38189] the picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to; the
939987 [38190] very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with
939987 [38191] both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool's
939987 [38192] cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin
939987 [38193] has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and
939987 [38194] that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
939987 [38195] He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound
939987 [38196] him!
939987 [38197] 
939987 [38198] "Well,... mother I don't wonder at, it's like her, God bless her, but
939987 [38199] how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were
939987 [38200] nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes
939987 [38201] that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal.' I know that very well. I
939987 [38202] knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half
939987 [38203] years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that 'Dounia
939987 [38204] can put up with a great deal.' If she could put up with Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [38205] and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And
939987 [38206] now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up
939987 [38207] with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of
939987 [38208] wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband's
939987 [38209] bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted
939987 [38210] that he 'let it slip,' though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it
939987 [38211] was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
939987 [38212] possible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but
939987 [38213] she will have to live with the man. Why! she'd live on black bread
939987 [38214] and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral
939987 [38215] freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,
939987 [38216] much less Mr. Luzhin's money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew
939987 [38217] her and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there's no denying,
939987 [38218] the SvidrigaÃ¯lovs are a bitter pill! It's a bitter thing to spend one's
939987 [38219] life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know
939987 [38220] she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German
939987 [38221] master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself
939987 [38222] for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has
939987 [38223] nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of
939987 [38224] unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to
939987 [38225] become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What's the
939987 [38226] point of it? What's the answer? It's clear enough: for herself, for her
939987 [38227] comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone
939987 [38228] else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will
939987 [38229] sell herself! That's what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her
939987 [38230] mother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,
939987 [38231] 'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscience
939987 [38232] even, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my
939987 [38233] dear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn
939987 [38234] to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can
939987 [38235] persuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object. That's just
939987 [38236] like us, it's as clear as daylight. It's clear that Rodion Romanovitch
939987 [38237] Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,
939987 [38238] yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him
939987 [38239] a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may
939987 [38240] even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his
939987 [38241] life a famous man! But my mother? It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, her
939987 [38242] first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,
939987 [38243] loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even
939987 [38244] from Sonia's fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long
939987 [38245] as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both
939987 [38246] of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in
939987 [38247] it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with
939987 [38248] Mr. Luzhin. 'There can be no question of love,' mother writes. And what
939987 [38249] if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,
939987 [38250] contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to 'keep up your
939987 [38251] appearance,' too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness
939987 [38252] means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same
939987 [38253] thing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,
939987 [38254] Dounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it's
939987 [38255] simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be
939987 [38256] paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it's more than you can
939987 [38257] bear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the
939987 [38258] curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa
939987 [38259] Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,
939987 [38260] she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,
939987 [38261] indeed, what have you taken me for? I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia,
939987 [38262] I won't have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it
939987 [38263] shall not, it shall not! I won't accept it!"
939987 [38264] 
939987 [38265] He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.
939987 [38266] 
939987 [38267] "It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You'll
939987 [38268] forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your
939987 [38269] side to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you
939987 [38270] will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a
939987 [38271] post_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all _words_, but
939987 [38272] now? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And
939987 [38273] what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their
939987 [38274] hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the SvidrigaÃ¯lovs. How are
939987 [38275] you going to save them from SvidrigaÃ¯lovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch
939987 [38276] Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for
939987 [38277] them? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind
939987 [38278] with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a
939987 [38279] shadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have
939987 [38280] become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those
939987 [38281] ten years? Can you fancy?"
939987 [38282] 
939987 [38283] So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and
939987 [38284] finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not
939987 [38285] new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was
939987 [38286] long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long
939987 [38287] ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and
939987 [38288] gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken
939987 [38289] the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured
939987 [38290] his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his
939987 [38291] mother's letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear
939987 [38292] that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved
939987 [38293] questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it
939987 [38294] quickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...
939987 [38295] 
939987 [38296] "Or throw up life altogether!" he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--"accept
939987 [38297] one's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in
939987 [38298] oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!"
939987 [38299] 
939987 [38300] "Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have
939987 [38301] absolutely nowhere to turn?" Marmeladov's question came suddenly into
939987 [38302] his mind, "for every man must have somewhere to turn...."
939987 [38303] 
939987 [38304] He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,
939987 [38305] slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought
939987 [38306] recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must
939987 [38307] come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's
939987 [38308] thought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the
939987 [38309] thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,
939987 [38310] it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly
939987 [38311] became aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and
939987 [38312] there was a darkness before his eyes.
939987 [38313] 
939987 [38314] He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted
939987 [38315] to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----
939987 [38316] Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He
939987 [38317] walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little
939987 [38318] adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had
939987 [38319] noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first
939987 [38320] he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his
939987 [38321] path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the
939987 [38322] road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But
939987 [38323] there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front
939987 [38324] of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first
939987 [38325] reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more
939987 [38326] intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so
939987 [38327] strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl
939987 [38328] quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with
939987 [38329] no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had
939987 [38330] on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not
939987 [38331] properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the
939987 [38332] waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was
939987 [38333] flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was
939987 [38334] walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She
939987 [38335] drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the
939987 [38336] seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;
939987 [38337] she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,
939987 [38338] apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once
939987 [38339] that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He
939987 [38340] could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the
939987 [38341] face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than
939987 [38342] fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking
939987 [38343] and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was
939987 [38344] doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and
939987 [38345] showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.
939987 [38346] 
939987 [38347] Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,
939987 [38348] and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much
939987 [38349] frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite
939987 [38350] deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen
939987 [38351] paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,
939987 [38352] too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object
939987 [38353] of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had
939987 [38354] followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at
939987 [38355] him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding
939987 [38356] his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His
939987 [38357] intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set
939987 [38358] man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and
939987 [38359] moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult
939987 [38360] this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked
939987 [38361] towards the gentleman.
939987 [38362] 
939987 [38363] "Hey! You SvidrigaÃ¯lov! What do you want here?" he shouted, clenching
939987 [38364] his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.
939987 [38365] 
939987 [38366] "What do you mean?" the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty
939987 [38367] astonishment.
939987 [38368] 
939987 [38369] "Get away, that's what I mean."
939987 [38370] 
939987 [38371] "How dare you, you low fellow!"
939987 [38372] 
939987 [38373] He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without
939987 [38374] reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like
939987 [38375] himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a
939987 [38376] police constable stood between them.
939987 [38377] 
939987 [38378] "That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What
939987 [38379] do you want? Who are you?" he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his
939987 [38380] rags.
939987 [38381] 
939987 [38382] Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,
939987 [38383] soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.
939987 [38384] 
939987 [38385] "You are just the man I want," Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.
939987 [38386] "I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too," he
939987 [38387] added, addressing the gentleman, "come along, I have something to show
939987 [38388] you."
939987 [38389] 
939987 [38390] And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.
939987 [38391] 
939987 [38392] "Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.
939987 [38393] There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a
939987 [38394] professional. It's more likely she has been given drink and deceived
939987 [38395] somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they've put her
939987 [38396] out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and
939987 [38397] the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has
939987 [38398] not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands;
939987 [38399] that's evident. And now look there: I don't know that dandy with whom I
939987 [38400] was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen
939987 [38401] her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now
939987 [38402] he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she
939987 [38403] is in this state... that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw
939987 [38404] him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he
939987 [38405] is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and
939987 [38406] is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we
939987 [38407] keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?"
939987 [38408] 
939987 [38409] The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to
939987 [38410] understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to
939987 [38411] examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.
939987 [38412] 
939987 [38413] "Ah, what a pity!" he said, shaking his head--"why, she is quite a
939987 [38414] child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,"
939987 [38415] he began addressing her, "where do you live?" The girl opened her weary
939987 [38416] and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her
939987 [38417] hand.
939987 [38418] 
939987 [38419] "Here," said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty
939987 [38420] copecks, "here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The
939987 [38421] only thing is to find out her address!"
939987 [38422] 
939987 [38423] "Missy, missy!" the policeman began again, taking the money. "I'll fetch
939987 [38424] you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do
939987 [38425] you live?"
939987 [38426] 
939987 [38427] "Go away! They won't let me alone," the girl muttered, and once more
939987 [38428] waved her hand.
939987 [38429] 
939987 [38430] "Ach, ach, how shocking! It's shameful, missy, it's a shame!" He shook
939987 [38431] his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.
939987 [38432] 
939987 [38433] "It's a difficult job," the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he
939987 [38434] did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have
939987 [38435] seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!
939987 [38436] 
939987 [38437] "Did you meet her far from here?" he asked him.
939987 [38438] 
939987 [38439] "I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in
939987 [38440] the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it."
939987 [38441] 
939987 [38442] "Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have
939987 [38443] mercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been
939987 [38444] deceived, that's a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....
939987 [38445] Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to
939987 [38446] gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.
939987 [38447] She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady," and he bent over her
939987 [38448] once more.
939987 [38449] 
939987 [38450] Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, "looking like ladies and
939987 [38451] refined" with pretensions to gentility and smartness....
939987 [38452] 
939987 [38453] "The chief thing is," Raskolnikov persisted, "to keep her out of this
939987 [38454] scoundrel's hands! Why should he outrage her! It's as clear as day what
939987 [38455] he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!"
939987 [38456] 
939987 [38457] Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,
939987 [38458] and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and
939987 [38459] confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another
939987 [38460] ten paces away and again halted.
939987 [38461] 
939987 [38462] "Keep her out of his hands we can," said the constable thoughtfully,
939987 [38463] "if only she'd tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,
939987 [38464] missy!" he bent over her once more.
939987 [38465] 
939987 [38466] She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as
939987 [38467] though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the
939987 [38468] direction from which she had come. "Oh shameful wretches, they won't let
939987 [38469] me alone!" she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though
939987 [38470] staggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,
939987 [38471] keeping his eye on her.
939987 [38472] 
939987 [38473] "Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her," the policeman said
939987 [38474] resolutely, and he set off after them.
939987 [38475] 
939987 [38476] "Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!" he repeated aloud, sighing.
939987 [38477] 
939987 [38478] At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a
939987 [38479] complete revulsion of feeling came over him.
939987 [38480] 
939987 [38481] "Hey, here!" he shouted after the policeman.
939987 [38482] 
939987 [38483] The latter turned round.
939987 [38484] 
939987 [38485] "Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse
939987 [38486] himself." He pointed at the dandy, "What is it to do with you?"
939987 [38487] 
939987 [38488] The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov
939987 [38489] laughed.
939987 [38490] 
939987 [38491] "Well!" ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he
939987 [38492] walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a
939987 [38493] madman or something even worse.
939987 [38494] 
939987 [38495] "He has carried off my twenty copecks," Raskolnikov murmured angrily
939987 [38496] when he was left alone. "Well, let him take as much from the other
939987 [38497] fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I
939987 [38498] want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let
939987 [38499] them devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give him
939987 [38500] twenty copecks? Were they mine?"
939987 [38501] 
939987 [38502] In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on
939987 [38503] the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard
939987 [38504] to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself
939987 [38505] altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life
939987 [38506] anew....
939987 [38507] 
939987 [38508] "Poor girl!" he said, looking at the empty corner where she had
939987 [38509] sat--"She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find
939987 [38510] out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and
939987 [38511] then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the
939987 [38512] Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be
939987 [38513] slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital
939987 [38514] directly (that's always the luck of those girls with respectable
939987 [38515] mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...
939987 [38516] drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a
939987 [38517] wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen
939987 [38518] cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they've all
939987 [38519] come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That's as it should
939987 [38520] be, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year
939987 [38521] go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain
939987 [38522] chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words
939987 [38523] they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you've said
939987 [38524] 'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. If we had any other
939987 [38525] word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one
939987 [38526] of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?
939987 [38527] 
939987 [38528] "But where am I going?" he thought suddenly. "Strange, I came out for
939987 [38529] something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going
939987 [38530] to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That's what it was... now I
939987 [38531] remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin
939987 [38532] into my head just now? That's curious."
939987 [38533] 
939987 [38534] He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the
939987 [38535] university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at
939987 [38536] the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did
939987 [38537] not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave
939987 [38538] him up. He took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements or
939987 [38539] conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,
939987 [38540] and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,
939987 [38541] and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though
939987 [38542] he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades
939987 [38543] to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in
939987 [38544] development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and
939987 [38545] interests were beneath him.
939987 [38546] 
939987 [38547] With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and
939987 [38548] communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other
939987 [38549] terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid
939987 [38550] youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and
939987 [38551] dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades
939987 [38552] understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,
939987 [38553] though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking
939987 [38554] appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was
939987 [38555] sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.
939987 [38556] One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid
939987 [38557] a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking
939987 [38558] powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went
939987 [38559] too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.
939987 [38560] Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and
939987 [38561] it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He
939987 [38562] could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was
939987 [38563] very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of
939987 [38564] one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn
939987 [38565] money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to
939987 [38566] declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in
939987 [38567] the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the
939987 [38568] university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his
939987 [38569] might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had
939987 [38570] not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even
939987 [38571] know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,
939987 [38572] but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that
939987 [38573] he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed
939987 [38574] him by, as he did not want to annoy him.
939987 [38575] 
939987 [38576] 
939987 [38577] 
939987 [38578] CHAPTER V
939987 [38579] 
939987 [38580] "Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask for
939987 [38581] work, to ask him to get me lessons or something..." Raskolnikov thought,
939987 [38582] "but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose
939987 [38583] he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that
939987 [38584] I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...
939987 [38585] hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I
939987 [38586] earn? That's not what I want now. It's really absurd for me to go to
939987 [38587] Razumihin...."
939987 [38588] 
939987 [38589] The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
939987 [38590] than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
939987 [38591] significance in this apparently ordinary action.
939987 [38592] 
939987 [38593] "Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by
939987 [38594] means of Razumihin alone?" he asked himself in perplexity.
939987 [38595] 
939987 [38596] He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long
939987 [38597] musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic
939987 [38598] thought came into his head.
939987 [38599] 
939987 [38600] "Hm... to Razumihin's," he said all at once, calmly, as though he had
939987 [38601] reached a final determination. "I shall go to Razumihin's of course,
939987 [38602] but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It
939987 [38603] will be over and everything will begin afresh...."
939987 [38604] 
939987 [38605] And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.
939987 [38606] 
939987 [38607] "After It," he shouted, jumping up from the seat, "but is It really
939987 [38608] going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?" He left the
939987 [38609] seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,
939987 [38610] but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;
939987 [38611] in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a
939987 [38612] month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.
939987 [38613] 
939987 [38614] His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel
939987 [38615] shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he
939987 [38616] began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all
939987 [38617] the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his
939987 [38618] attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into
939987 [38619] brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,
939987 [38620] he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he
939987 [38621] was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came
939987 [38622] out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the
939987 [38623] islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary
939987 [38624] eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in
939987 [38625] and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,
939987 [38626] no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid
939987 [38627] irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer
939987 [38628] villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw
939987 [38629] in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,
939987 [38630] and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his
939987 [38631] attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by
939987 [38632] luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them
939987 [38633] with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from
939987 [38634] his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had
939987 [38635] thirty copecks. "Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the
939987 [38636] letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs
939987 [38637] yesterday," he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he
939987 [38638] soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
939987 [38639] He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he
939987 [38640] was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a
939987 [38641] pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long
939987 [38642] while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,
939987 [38643] though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and
939987 [38644] a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching
939987 [38645] Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road
939987 [38646] into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
939987 [38647] 
939987 [38648] In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular
939987 [38649] actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times
939987 [38650] monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are
939987 [38651] so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but
939987 [38652] so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like
939987 [38653] Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking
939987 [38654] state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a
939987 [38655] powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
939987 [38656] 
939987 [38657] Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood
939987 [38658] in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,
939987 [38659] walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It
939987 [38660] was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;
939987 [38661] indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in
939987 [38662] memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not
939987 [38663] even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark
939987 [38664] blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market
939987 [38665] garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a
939987 [38666] feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.
939987 [38667] There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,
939987 [38668] hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking
939987 [38669] figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his
939987 [38670] father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road
939987 [38671] became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a
939987 [38672] winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the
939987 [38673] right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone
939987 [38674] church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three
939987 [38675] times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in
939987 [38676] memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never
939987 [38677] seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a
939987 [38678] table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in
939987 [38679] the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned
939987 [38680] ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother's
939987 [38681] grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger
939987 [38682] brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,
939987 [38683] but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited
939987 [38684] the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and
939987 [38685] to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was
939987 [38686] walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he
939987 [38687] was holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A
939987 [38688] peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be
939987 [38689] some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed
939987 [38690] townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,
939987 [38691] all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern
939987 [38692] stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually
939987 [38693] drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy
939987 [38694] goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their
939987 [38695] long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect
939987 [38696] mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going
939987 [38697] with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of
939987 [38698] such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants'
939987 [38699] nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load
939987 [38700] of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in
939987 [38701] a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even
939987 [38702] about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that
939987 [38703] he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the
939987 [38704] window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing
939987 [38705] and the balalaÃ¯ka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken
939987 [38706] peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over
939987 [38707] their shoulders.
939987 [38708] 
939987 [38709] "Get in, get in!" shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with
939987 [38710] a fleshy face red as a carrot. "I'll take you all, get in!"
939987 [38711] 
939987 [38712] But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the
939987 [38713] crowd.
939987 [38714] 
939987 [38715] "Take us all with a beast like that!"
939987 [38716] 
939987 [38717] "Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?"
939987 [38718] 
939987 [38719] "And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!"
939987 [38720] 
939987 [38721] "Get in, I'll take you all," Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into
939987 [38722] the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. "The bay
939987 [38723] has gone with Matvey," he shouted from the cart--"and this brute, mates,
939987 [38724] is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She's just
939987 [38725] eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I'll make her gallop! She'll
939987 [38726] gallop!" and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to
939987 [38727] flog the little mare.
939987 [38728] 
939987 [38729] "Get in! Come along!" The crowd laughed. "D'you hear, she'll gallop!"
939987 [38730] 
939987 [38731] "Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!"
939987 [38732] 
939987 [38733] "She'll jog along!"
939987 [38734] 
939987 [38735] "Don't you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!"
939987 [38736] 
939987 [38737] "All right! Give it to her!"
939987 [38738] 
939987 [38739] They all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes. Six
939987 [38740] men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,
939987 [38741] rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded
939987 [38742] headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.
939987 [38743] The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help
939987 [38744] laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a
939987 [38745] gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to
939987 [38746] help Mikolka. With the cry of "now," the mare tugged with all her might,
939987 [38747] but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with
939987 [38748] her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which
939987 [38749] were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the
939987 [38750] crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed
939987 [38751] the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.
939987 [38752] 
939987 [38753] "Let me get in, too, mates," shouted a young man in the crowd whose
939987 [38754] appetite was aroused.
939987 [38755] 
939987 [38756] "Get in, all get in," cried Mikolka, "she will draw you all. I'll beat
939987 [38757] her to death!" And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself
939987 [38758] with fury.
939987 [38759] 
939987 [38760] "Father, father," he cried, "father, what are they doing? Father, they
939987 [38761] are beating the poor horse!"
939987 [38762] 
939987 [38763] "Come along, come along!" said his father. "They are drunken and
939987 [38764] foolish, they are in fun; come away, don't look!" and he tried to draw
939987 [38765] him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself
939987 [38766] with horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was
939987 [38767] gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.
939987 [38768] 
939987 [38769] "Beat her to death," cried Mikolka, "it's come to that. I'll do for
939987 [38770] her!"
939987 [38771] 
939987 [38772] "What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?" shouted an old man
939987 [38773] in the crowd.
939987 [38774] 
939987 [38775] "Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a
939987 [38776] cartload," said another.
939987 [38777] 
939987 [38778] "You'll kill her," shouted the third.
939987 [38779] 
939987 [38780] "Don't meddle! It's my property, I'll do what I choose. Get in, more of
939987 [38781] you! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!..."
939987 [38782] 
939987 [38783] All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,
939987 [38784] roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man
939987 [38785] could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that
939987 [38786] trying to kick!
939987 [38787] 
939987 [38788] Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her
939987 [38789] about the ribs. One ran each side.
939987 [38790] 
939987 [38791] "Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes," cried Mikolka.
939987 [38792] 
939987 [38793] "Give us a song, mates," shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the
939987 [38794] cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The
939987 [38795] woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.
939987 [38796] 
939987 [38797] ... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped
939987 [38798] across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his
939987 [38799] tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across
939987 [38800] the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he
939987 [38801] rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was
939987 [38802] shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and
939987 [38803] would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to
939987 [38804] the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.
939987 [38805] 
939987 [38806] "I'll teach you to kick," Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down
939987 [38807] the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,
939987 [38808] thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort
939987 [38809] brandished it over the mare.
939987 [38810] 
939987 [38811] "He'll crush her," was shouted round him. "He'll kill her!"
939987 [38812] 
939987 [38813] "It's my property," shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a
939987 [38814] swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.
939987 [38815] 
939987 [38816] "Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?" shouted voices in the
939987 [38817] crowd.
939987 [38818] 
939987 [38819] And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time
939987 [38820] on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but
939987 [38821] lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on
939987 [38822] one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six
939987 [38823] whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised
939987 [38824] again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured
939987 [38825] blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.
939987 [38826] 
939987 [38827] "She's a tough one," was shouted in the crowd.
939987 [38828] 
939987 [38829] "She'll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her," said
939987 [38830] an admiring spectator in the crowd.
939987 [38831] 
939987 [38832] "Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off," shouted a third.
939987 [38833] 
939987 [38834] "I'll show you! Stand off," Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down
939987 [38835] the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. "Look
939987 [38836] out," he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the
939987 [38837] poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,
939987 [38838] but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on
939987 [38839] the ground like a log.
939987 [38840] 
939987 [38841] "Finish her off," shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of
939987 [38842] the cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything
939987 [38843] they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying
939987 [38844] mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the
939987 [38845] crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.
939987 [38846] 
939987 [38847] "You butchered her," someone shouted in the crowd.
939987 [38848] 
939987 [38849] "Why wouldn't she gallop then?"
939987 [38850] 
939987 [38851] "My property!" shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar
939987 [38852] in his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to
939987 [38853] beat.
939987 [38854] 
939987 [38855] "No mistake about it, you are not a Christian," many voices were
939987 [38856] shouting in the crowd.
939987 [38857] 
939987 [38858] But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the
939987 [38859] crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and
939987 [38860] kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and
939987 [38861] flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant
939987 [38862] his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried
939987 [38863] him out of the crowd.
939987 [38864] 
939987 [38865] "Come along, come! Let us go home," he said to him.
939987 [38866] 
939987 [38867] "Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!" he sobbed, but his
939987 [38868] voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.
939987 [38869] 
939987 [38870] "They are drunk.... They are brutal... it's not our business!" said his
939987 [38871] father. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He
939987 [38872] tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.
939987 [38873] 
939987 [38874] He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and
939987 [38875] stood up in terror.
939987 [38876] 
939987 [38877] "Thank God, that was only a dream," he said, sitting down under a tree
939987 [38878] and drawing deep breaths. "But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?
939987 [38879] Such a hideous dream!"
939987 [38880] 
939987 [38881] He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He
939987 [38882] rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.
939987 [38883] 
939987 [38884] "Good God!" he cried, "can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an
939987 [38885] axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I
939987 [38886] shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;
939987 [38887] hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it
939987 [38888] be?"
939987 [38889] 
939987 [38890] He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.
939987 [38891] 
939987 [38892] "But why am I going on like this?" he continued, sitting up again, as it
939987 [38893] were in profound amazement. "I knew that I could never bring myself
939987 [38894] to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,
939987 [38895] yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I
939987 [38896] realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going
939987 [38897] over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs
939987 [38898] yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the
939987 [38899] very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.
939987 [38900] 
939987 [38901] "No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Granted, granted that there is
939987 [38902] no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last
939987 [38903] month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn't
939987 [38904] bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am
939987 [38905] I still...?"
939987 [38906] 
939987 [38907] He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at
939987 [38908] finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,
939987 [38909] his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly
939987 [38910] to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that
939987 [38911] had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense
939987 [38912] of relief and peace in his soul. "Lord," he prayed, "show me my path--I
939987 [38913] renounce that accursed... dream of mine."
939987 [38914] 
939987 [38915] Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the
939987 [38916] glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he
939987 [38917] was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been
939987 [38918] forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,
939987 [38919] freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!
939987 [38920] 
939987 [38921] Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during
939987 [38922] those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously
939987 [38923] impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very
939987 [38924] exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined
939987 [38925] turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to
939987 [38926] himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been
939987 [38927] more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,
939987 [38928] he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was
939987 [38929] obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It
939987 [38930] is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without
939987 [38931] noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking
939987 [38932] himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time
939987 [38933] such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he
939987 [38934] had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his
939987 [38935] life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances
939987 [38936] in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive
939987 [38937] influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for
939987 [38938] him on purpose!
939987 [38939] 
939987 [38940] It was about nine o'clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables
939987 [38941] and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were
939987 [38942] closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their
939987 [38943] wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and
939987 [38944] costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty
939987 [38945] and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly
939987 [38946] liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly
939987 [38947] in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,
939987 [38948] and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At
939987 [38949] the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out
939987 [38950] with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to
939987 [38951] go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just
939987 [38952] come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone
939987 [38953] called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona
939987 [38954] Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his
939987 [38955] watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta
939987 [38956] and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about
939987 [38957] thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was
939987 [38958] a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who
939987 [38959] made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with
939987 [38960] a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and
939987 [38961] doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The
939987 [38962] moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange
939987 [38963] sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing
939987 [38964] astonishing about this meeting.
939987 [38965] 
939987 [38966] "You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna," the
939987 [38967] huckster was saying aloud. "Come round to-morrow about seven. They will
939987 [38968] be here too."
939987 [38969] 
939987 [38970] "To-morrow?" said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to
939987 [38971] make up her mind.
939987 [38972] 
939987 [38973] "Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna," gabbled
939987 [38974] the huckster's wife, a lively little woman. "I look at you, you are like
939987 [38975] some little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a
939987 [38976] step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!"
939987 [38977] 
939987 [38978] "But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna," her husband
939987 [38979] interrupted; "that's my advice, but come round to us without asking.
939987 [38980] It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a
939987 [38981] notion."
939987 [38982] 
939987 [38983] "Am I to come?"
939987 [38984] 
939987 [38985] "About seven o'clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able
939987 [38986] to decide for yourself."
939987 [38987] 
939987 [38988] "And we'll have a cup of tea," added his wife.
939987 [38989] 
939987 [38990] "All right, I'll come," said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began
939987 [38991] slowly moving away.
939987 [38992] 
939987 [38993] Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,
939987 [38994] unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed
939987 [38995] by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had
939987 [38996] learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at
939987 [38997] seven o'clock Lizaveta, the old woman's sister and only companion, would
939987 [38998] be away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old
939987 [38999] woman _would be left alone_.
939987 [39000] 
939987 [39001] He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man
939987 [39002] condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;
939987 [39003] but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom
939987 [39004] of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably
939987 [39005] decided.
939987 [39006] 
939987 [39007] Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he
939987 [39008] could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan
939987 [39009] than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have
939987 [39010] been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with
939987 [39011] greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and
939987 [39012] investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose
939987 [39013] life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
939987 [39014] 
939987 [39015] 
939987 [39016] 
939987 [39017] CHAPTER VI
939987 [39018] 
939987 [39019] Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his
939987 [39020] wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was
939987 [39021] nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been
939987 [39022] reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all
939987 [39023] women's things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,
939987 [39024] they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta's business. She
939987 [39025] undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest
939987 [39026] and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule
939987 [39027] little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
939987 [39028] 
939987 [39029] But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of
939987 [39030] superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.
939987 [39031] And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something
939987 [39032] strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar
939987 [39033] influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew
939987 [39034] called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to
939987 [39035] give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he
939987 [39036] might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for
939987 [39037] he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had
939987 [39038] remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his
939987 [39039] father's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,
939987 [39040] a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When
939987 [39041] he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her
939987 [39042] at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got
939987 [39043] two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way
939987 [39044] home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange
939987 [39045] idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very
939987 [39046] much absorbed him.
939987 [39047] 
939987 [39048] Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he
939987 [39049] did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had
939987 [39050] played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard
939987 [39051] the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and
939987 [39052] give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he
939987 [39053] had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course
939987 [39054] it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary
939987 [39055] impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;
939987 [39056] the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona
939987 [39057] Ivanovna.
939987 [39058] 
939987 [39059] "She is first-rate," he said. "You can always get money from her. She is
939987 [39060] as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and
939987 [39061] she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have
939987 [39062] had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy...."
939987 [39063] 
939987 [39064] And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you
939987 [39065] were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she
939987 [39066] gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven
939987 [39067] percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying
939987 [39068] that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was
939987 [39069] continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,
939987 [39070] though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.
939987 [39071] 
939987 [39072] "There's a phenomenon for you," cried the student and he laughed.
939987 [39073] 
939987 [39074] They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a
939987 [39075] peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened
939987 [39076] with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending
939987 [39077] for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about
939987 [39078] her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,
939987 [39079] being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked
939987 [39080] day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the
939987 [39081] washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister
939987 [39082] all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind
939987 [39083] without her sister's permission. The old woman had already made her
939987 [39084] will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a
939987 [39085] farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was
939987 [39086] left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be
939987 [39087] said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,
939987 [39088] unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long
939987 [39089] feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered
939987 [39090] goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed
939987 [39091] most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was
939987 [39092] continually with child.
939987 [39093] 
939987 [39094] "But you say she is hideous?" observed the officer.
939987 [39095] 
939987 [39096] "Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but
939987 [39097] you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face
939987 [39098] and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are
939987 [39099] attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up
939987 [39100] with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is
939987 [39101] really very sweet."
939987 [39102] 
939987 [39103] "You seem to find her attractive yourself," laughed the officer.
939987 [39104] 
939987 [39105] "From her queerness. No, I'll tell you what. I could kill that damned
939987 [39106] old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the
939987 [39107] faintest conscience-prick," the student added with warmth. The officer
939987 [39108] laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!
939987 [39109] 
939987 [39110] "Listen, I want to ask you a serious question," the student said hotly.
939987 [39111] "I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,
939987 [39112] senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply
939987 [39113] useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is
939987 [39114] living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You
939987 [39115] understand? You understand?"
939987 [39116] 
939987 [39117] "Yes, yes, I understand," answered the officer, watching his excited
939987 [39118] companion attentively.
939987 [39119] 
939987 [39120] "Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for
939987 [39121] want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good
939987 [39122] deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman's money which will be
939987 [39123] buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the
939987 [39124] right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from
939987 [39125] vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take
939987 [39126] her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of
939987 [39127] humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny
939987 [39128] crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands
939987 [39129] would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives
939987 [39130] in exchange--it's simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of
939987 [39131] that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
939987 [39132] No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact
939987 [39133] because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of
939987 [39134] others; the other day she bit Lizaveta's finger out of spite; it almost
939987 [39135] had to be amputated."
939987 [39136] 
939987 [39137] "Of course she does not deserve to live," remarked the officer, "but
939987 [39138] there it is, it's nature."
939987 [39139] 
939987 [39140] "Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but
939987 [39141] for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,
939987 [39142] there would never have been a single great man. They talk of
939987 [39143] duty, conscience--I don't want to say anything against duty and
939987 [39144] conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have
939987 [39145] another question to ask you. Listen!"
939987 [39146] 
939987 [39147] "No, you stay, I'll ask you a question. Listen!"
939987 [39148] 
939987 [39149] "Well?"
939987 [39150] 
939987 [39151] "You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the
939987 [39152] old woman _yourself_?"
939987 [39153] 
939987 [39154] "Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It's nothing to
939987 [39155] do with me...."
939987 [39156] 
939987 [39157] "But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there's no justice about
939987 [39158] it.... Let us have another game."
939987 [39159] 
939987 [39160] Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary
939987 [39161] youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in
939987 [39162] different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear
939987 [39163] such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain
939987 [39164] was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the
939987 [39165] moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old
939987 [39166] woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This
939987 [39167] coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern
939987 [39168] had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had
939987 [39169] really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....
939987 [39170] 
939987 [39171] *****
939987 [39172] 
939987 [39173] On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
939987 [39174] for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no
939987 [39175] candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never
939987 [39176] recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At
939987 [39177] last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised
939987 [39178] with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep
939987 [39179] came over him, as it were crushing him.
939987 [39180] 
939987 [39181] He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,
939987 [39182] coming into his room at ten o'clock the next morning, had difficulty
939987 [39183] in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the
939987 [39184] second brew and again in her own tea-pot.
939987 [39185] 
939987 [39186] "My goodness, how he sleeps!" she cried indignantly. "And he is always
939987 [39187] asleep."
939987 [39188] 
939987 [39189] He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in
939987 [39190] his garret and sank back on the sofa again.
939987 [39191] 
939987 [39192] "Going to sleep again," cried Nastasya. "Are you ill, eh?"
939987 [39193] 
939987 [39194] He made no reply.
939987 [39195] 
939987 [39196] "Do you want some tea?"
939987 [39197] 
939987 [39198] "Afterwards," he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning
939987 [39199] to the wall.
939987 [39200] 
939987 [39201] Nastasya stood over him.
939987 [39202] 
939987 [39203] "Perhaps he really is ill," she said, turned and went out. She came in
939987 [39204] again at two o'clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood
939987 [39205] untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully
939987 [39206] rousing him.
939987 [39207] 
939987 [39208] "Why are you lying like a log?" she shouted, looking at him with
939987 [39209] repulsion.
939987 [39210] 
939987 [39211] He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.
939987 [39212] 
939987 [39213] "Are you ill or not?" asked Nastasya and again received no answer.
939987 [39214] "You'd better go out and get a breath of air," she said after a pause.
939987 [39215] "Will you eat it or not?"
939987 [39216] 
939987 [39217] "Afterwards," he said weakly. "You can go."
939987 [39218] 
939987 [39219] And he motioned her out.
939987 [39220] 
939987 [39221] She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went
939987 [39222] out.
939987 [39223] 
939987 [39224] A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while
939987 [39225] at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and
939987 [39226] began to eat.
939987 [39227] 
939987 [39228] He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were
939987 [39229] mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself
939987 [39230] on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,
939987 [39231] with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such
939987 [39232] strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was
939987 [39233] in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,
939987 [39234] the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a
939987 [39235] complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water
939987 [39236] from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was
939987 [39237] wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured
939987 [39238] stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like
939987 [39239] gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,
939987 [39240] raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,
939987 [39241] suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the
939987 [39242] sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began
939987 [39243] listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet
939987 [39244] on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and
939987 [39245] monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the
939987 [39246] previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And
939987 [39247] meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction
939987 [39248] were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted
939987 [39249] haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his
939987 [39250] energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart
939987 [39251] kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had
939987 [39252] to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He
939987 [39253] rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away
939987 [39254] under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long
939987 [39255] strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded
939987 [39256] this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some
939987 [39257] stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two
939987 [39258] ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook
939987 [39259] as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside
939987 [39260] when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready
939987 [39261] long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the
939987 [39262] noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended
939987 [39263] for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the
939987 [39264] street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have
939987 [39265] had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now
939987 [39266] he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang
939987 [39267] quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat
939987 [39268] pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did
939987 [39269] not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it
939987 [39270] could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the
939987 [39271] hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a
939987 [39272] fortnight before.
939987 [39273] 
939987 [39274] When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening
939987 [39275] between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out
939987 [39276] the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This
939987 [39277] pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and
939987 [39278] thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood
939987 [39279] in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of
939987 [39280] a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece
939987 [39281] of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.
939987 [39282] Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,
939987 [39283] he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round
939987 [39284] them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and
939987 [39285] tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This
939987 [39286] was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while
939987 [39287] she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip
939987 [39288] was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first
939987 [39289] minute that the "thing" was made of wood. All this had been stored by
939987 [39290] him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when
939987 [39291] he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
939987 [39292] 
939987 [39293] "It struck six long ago."
939987 [39294] 
939987 [39295] "Long ago! My God!"
939987 [39296] 
939987 [39297] He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend
939987 [39298] his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the
939987 [39299] most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the
939987 [39300] deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a
939987 [39301] pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less
939987 [39302] on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in
939987 [39303] passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by
939987 [39304] him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final
939987 [39305] they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in
939987 [39306] his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for
939987 [39307] a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his
939987 [39308] plans.
939987 [39309] 
939987 [39310] And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point
939987 [39311] could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of
939987 [39312] any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all
939987 [39313] as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of
939987 [39314] unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,
939987 [39315] that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.
939987 [39316] Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;
939987 [39317] she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the
939987 [39318] door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her
939987 [39319] about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into
939987 [39320] the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything
939987 [39321] was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.
939987 [39322] Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had
939987 [39323] come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait
939987 [39324] till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss
939987 [39325] the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at
939987 [39326] least grounds for suspicion.
939987 [39327] 
939987 [39328] But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and
939987 [39329] indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off
939987 [39330] trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed
939987 [39331] utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not
939987 [39332] imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get
939987 [39333] up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with
939987 [39334] the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at
939987 [39335] an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say
939987 [39336] "come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!"--and at once he
939987 [39337] had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.
939987 [39338] Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his
939987 [39339] analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he
939987 [39340] could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort
939987 [39341] he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought
939987 [39342] arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were
939987 [39343] forcing and drawing him to it.
939987 [39344] 
939987 [39345] At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one
939987 [39346] question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily
939987 [39347] detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He
939987 [39348] had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his
939987 [39349] opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility
939987 [39350] of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every
939987 [39351] criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a
939987 [39352] childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence
939987 [39353] and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse
939987 [39354] of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,
939987 [39355] developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the
939987 [39356] perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment
939987 [39357] of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the
939987 [39358] individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The
939987 [39359] question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the
939987 [39360] crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of
939987 [39361] the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.
939987 [39362] 
939987 [39363] When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there
939987 [39364] could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would
939987 [39365] remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the
939987 [39366] simple reason that his design was "not a crime...." We will omit all the
939987 [39367] process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have
939987 [39368] run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely
939987 [39369] material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his
939987 [39370] mind. "One has but to keep all one's will-power and reason to deal
939987 [39371] with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has
939987 [39372] familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business...." But
939987 [39373] this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he
939987 [39374] came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite
939987 [39375] differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
939987 [39376] 
939987 [39377] One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even
939987 [39378] left the staircase. When he reached the landlady's kitchen, the door
939987 [39379] of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in
939987 [39380] Nastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether
939987 [39381] the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when
939987 [39382] he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly
939987 [39383] saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied
939987 [39384] there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing
939987 [39385] him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him
939987 [39386] all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as
939987 [39387] though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not
939987 [39388] the axe! He was overwhelmed.
939987 [39389] 
939987 [39390] "What made me think," he reflected, as he went under the gateway, "what
939987 [39391] made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
939987 [39392] Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?"
939987 [39393] 
939987 [39394] He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in
939987 [39395] his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.
939987 [39396] 
939987 [39397] He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk
939987 [39398] for appearance' sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more
939987 [39399] revolting. "And what a chance I have lost for ever!" he muttered,
939987 [39400] standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter's little
939987 [39401] dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter's
939987 [39402] room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the
939987 [39403] right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the
939987 [39404] room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called
939987 [39405] the porter. "Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for
939987 [39406] the door is wide open." He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled
939987 [39407] it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;
939987 [39408] at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both
939987 [39409] hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!
939987 [39410] "When reason fails, the devil helps!" he thought with a strange grin.
939987 [39411] This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
939987 [39412] 
939987 [39413] He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening
939987 [39414] suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking
939987 [39415] at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.
939987 [39416] Suddenly he thought of his hat. "Good heavens! I had the money the day
939987 [39417] before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!" A curse rose
939987 [39418] from the bottom of his soul.
939987 [39419] 
939987 [39420] Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on
939987 [39421] the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at
939987 [39422] the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the
939987 [39423] other side....
939987 [39424] 
939987 [39425] When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes
939987 [39426] thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much
939987 [39427] afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied
939987 [39428] by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov
939987 [39429] garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great
939987 [39430] fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all
939987 [39431] the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer
939987 [39432] garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the
939987 [39433] garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a
939987 [39434] great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why
939987 [39435] in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some
939987 [39436] peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there
939987 [39437] are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all
939987 [39438] sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back
939987 [39439] to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. "What nonsense!"
939987 [39440] he thought, "better think of nothing at all!"
939987 [39441] 
939987 [39442] "So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that
939987 [39443] meets them on the way," flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,
939987 [39444] like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now
939987 [39445] he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock
939987 [39446] somewhere struck once. "What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it
939987 [39447] must be fast!"
939987 [39448] 
939987 [39449] Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very
939987 [39450] moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had
939987 [39451] just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under
939987 [39452] the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into
939987 [39453] the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other
939987 [39454] side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one
939987 [39455] noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge
939987 [39456] quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his
939987 [39457] head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old
939987 [39458] woman's room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was
939987 [39459] already on the stairs....
939987 [39460] 
939987 [39461] Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and
939987 [39462] once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly
939987 [39463] and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the
939987 [39464] stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no
939987 [39465] one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were
939987 [39466] at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought
939987 [39467] a minute and went on. "Of course it would be better if they had not been
939987 [39468] here, but... it's two storeys above them."
939987 [39469] 
939987 [39470] And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the
939987 [39471] flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman's was
939987 [39472] apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been
939987 [39473] torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant
939987 [39474] the thought floated through his mind "Shall I go back?" But he made no
939987 [39475] answer and began listening at the old woman's door, a dead silence. Then
939987 [39476] he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...
939987 [39477] then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew
939987 [39478] himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. "Am I very pale?"
939987 [39479] he wondered. "Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I
939987 [39480] better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?"
939987 [39481] 
939987 [39482] But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite
939987 [39483] him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,
939987 [39484] he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he
939987 [39485] rang again, more loudly.
939987 [39486] 
939987 [39487] No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman
939987 [39488] was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some
939987 [39489] knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.
939987 [39490] Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to
939987 [39491] suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly
939987 [39492] heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the
939987 [39493] rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily
939987 [39494] close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly
939987 [39495] listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved
939987 [39496] a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have
939987 [39497] the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,
939987 [39498] and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out
939987 [39499] in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he
939987 [39500] had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and
939987 [39501] he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the
939987 [39502] latch unfastened.
939987 [39503] 
939987 [39504] 
939987 [39505] 
939987 [39506] CHAPTER VII
939987 [39507] 
939987 [39508] The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and
939987 [39509] suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost
939987 [39510] his head and nearly made a great mistake.
939987 [39511] 
939987 [39512] Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not
939987 [39513] hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took
939987 [39514] hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from
939987 [39515] attempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,
939987 [39516] but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with
939987 [39517] it on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not
939987 [39518] allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back
939987 [39519] in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared
939987 [39520] with open eyes at him.
939987 [39521] 
939987 [39522] "Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna," he began, trying to speak easily, but
939987 [39523] his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. "I have come... I have
939987 [39524] brought something... but we'd better come in... to the light...."
939987 [39525] 
939987 [39526] And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old
939987 [39527] woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
939987 [39528] 
939987 [39529] "Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?"
939987 [39530] 
939987 [39531] "Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you
939987 [39532] the pledge I promised the other day..." And he held out the pledge.
939987 [39533] 
939987 [39534] The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in
939987 [39535] the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and
939987 [39536] mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer
939987 [39537] in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that
939987 [39538] he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened
939987 [39539] that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half
939987 [39540] minute, he thought he would have run away from her.
939987 [39541] 
939987 [39542] "Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?" he said suddenly,
939987 [39543] also with malice. "Take it if you like, if not I'll go elsewhere, I am
939987 [39544] in a hurry."
939987 [39545] 
939987 [39546] He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of
939987 [39547] itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor's resolute tone
939987 [39548] evidently restored her confidence.
939987 [39549] 
939987 [39550] "But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?" she asked,
939987 [39551] looking at the pledge.
939987 [39552] 
939987 [39553] "The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know."
939987 [39554] 
939987 [39555] She held out her hand.
939987 [39556] 
939987 [39557] "But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
939987 [39558] Have you been bathing, or what?"
939987 [39559] 
939987 [39560] "Fever," he answered abruptly. "You can't help getting pale... if you've
939987 [39561] nothing to eat," he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
939987 [39562] 
939987 [39563] His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the
939987 [39564] truth; the old woman took the pledge.
939987 [39565] 
939987 [39566] "What is it?" she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and
939987 [39567] weighing the pledge in her hand.
939987 [39568] 
939987 [39569] "A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it."
939987 [39570] 
939987 [39571] "It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!"
939987 [39572] 
939987 [39573] Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all
939987 [39574] her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left
939987 [39575] him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He
939987 [39576] unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet
939987 [39577] take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the
939987 [39578] coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing
939987 [39579] more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and
939987 [39580] fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.
939987 [39581] 
939987 [39582] "But what has he tied it up like this for?" the old woman cried with
939987 [39583] vexation and moved towards him.
939987 [39584] 
939987 [39585] He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung
939987 [39586] it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without
939987 [39587] effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He
939987 [39588] seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once
939987 [39589] brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.
939987 [39590] 
939987 [39591] The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked
939987 [39592] with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and
939987 [39593] fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.
939987 [39594] As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She
939987 [39595] cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the
939987 [39596] floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held "the
939987 [39597] pledge." Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side
939987 [39598] and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the
939987 [39599] body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her
939987 [39600] face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,
939987 [39601] the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
939987 [39602] 
939987 [39603] He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her
939987 [39604] pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket
939987 [39605] from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full
939987 [39606] possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his
939987 [39607] hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been
939987 [39608] particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get
939987 [39609] smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,
939987 [39610] as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom
939987 [39611] with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
939987 [39612] Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with
939987 [39613] a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of
939987 [39614] drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the
939987 [39615] chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed
939987 [39616] over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go
939987 [39617] away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
939987 [39618] He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea
939987 [39619] occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be
939987 [39620] still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,
939987 [39621] he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more
939987 [39622] over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that
939987 [39623] she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw
939987 [39624] clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He
939987 [39625] was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed
939987 [39626] it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of
939987 [39627] blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but
939987 [39628] the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked
939987 [39629] with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but
939987 [39630] something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised
939987 [39631] the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not
939987 [39632] dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,
939987 [39633] after two minutes' hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off
939987 [39634] without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a
939987 [39635] purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of
939987 [39636] copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy
939987 [39637] chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed
939987 [39638] very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,
939987 [39639] flung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed back into the
939987 [39640] bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.
939987 [39641] 
939987 [39642] He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them
939987 [39643] again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It
939987 [39644] was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making
939987 [39645] mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one
939987 [39646] and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered
939987 [39647] and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging
939987 [39648] there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of
939987 [39649] drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,
939987 [39650] and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest
939987 [39651] of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old
939987 [39652] women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a
939987 [39653] good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched
939987 [39654] lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched
939987 [39655] key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was
939987 [39656] a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,
939987 [39657] then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but
939987 [39658] clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on
939987 [39659] the red brocade. "It's red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,"
939987 [39660] the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.
939987 [39661] "Good God, am I going out of my senses?" he thought with terror.
939987 [39662] 
939987 [39663] But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from
939987 [39664] under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned
939987 [39665] out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably
939987 [39666] all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,
939987 [39667] ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply
939987 [39668] wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with
939987 [39669] tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers
939987 [39670] and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he
939987 [39671] had not time to take many....
939987 [39672] 
939987 [39673] He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped
939987 [39674] short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been
939987 [39675] his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though
939987 [39676] someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for
939987 [39677] a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited
939987 [39678] holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of
939987 [39679] the bedroom.
939987 [39680] 
939987 [39681] In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
939987 [39682] She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet
939987 [39683] and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out
939987 [39684] of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a
939987 [39685] shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but
939987 [39686] still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the
939987 [39687] corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no
939987 [39688] sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her
939987 [39689] with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies' mouths,
939987 [39690] when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them
939987 [39691] and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so
939987 [39692] simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not
939987 [39693] even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary
939987 [39694] and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.
939987 [39695] She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding
939987 [39696] it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the
939987 [39697] sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the
939987 [39698] head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,
939987 [39699] snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
939987 [39700] 
939987 [39701] Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this
939987 [39702] second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place
939987 [39703] as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing
939987 [39704] and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the
939987 [39705] difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the
939987 [39706] absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,
939987 [39707] perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of
939987 [39708] that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would
939987 [39709] have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and
939987 [39710] not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had
939987 [39711] done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew
939987 [39712] stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even
939987 [39713] into the room for anything in the world.
939987 [39714] 
939987 [39715] But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take
939987 [39716] possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what
939987 [39717] was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the
939987 [39718] kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought
939987 [39719] him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.
939987 [39720] He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap
939987 [39721] that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands
939987 [39722] in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the
939987 [39723] blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where
939987 [39724] there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all
939987 [39725] with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and
939987 [39726] then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.
939987 [39727] There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He
939987 [39728] carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was
939987 [39729] possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,
939987 [39730] his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be
939987 [39731] nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
939987 [39732] But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something
939987 [39733] quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the
939987 [39734] room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea
939987 [39735] that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,
939987 [39736] of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something
939987 [39737] utterly different from what he was now doing. "Good God!" he muttered "I
939987 [39738] must fly, fly," and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror
939987 [39739] awaited him such as he had never known before.
939987 [39740] 
939987 [39741] He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer
939987 [39742] door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,
939987 [39743] was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,
939987 [39744] all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him
939987 [39745] perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta
939987 [39746] afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that
939987 [39747] she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!
939987 [39748] 
939987 [39749] He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
939987 [39750] 
939987 [39751] "But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away...."
939987 [39752] 
939987 [39753] He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the
939987 [39754] staircase.
939987 [39755] 
939987 [39756] He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,
939987 [39757] two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.
939987 [39758] "What are they about?" He waited patiently. At last all was still, as
939987 [39759] though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,
939987 [39760] but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone
939987 [39761] began going downstairs humming a tune. "How is it they all make such
939987 [39762] a noise?" flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and
939987 [39763] waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a
939987 [39764] step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.
939987 [39765] 
939987 [39766] The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but
939987 [39767] he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he
939987 [39768] began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,
939987 [39769] to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow
939987 [39770] peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now
939987 [39771] _he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was
939987 [39772] growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And
939987 [39773] now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to
939987 [39774] him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream
939987 [39775] in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is
939987 [39776] rooted to the spot and cannot even move one's arms.
939987 [39777] 
939987 [39778] At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly
939987 [39779] started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the
939987 [39780] flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,
939987 [39781] noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had
939987 [39782] done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown
939987 [39783] visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one
939987 [39784] another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when
939987 [39785] the door divided them and he was listening.
939987 [39786] 
939987 [39787] The visitor panted several times. "He must be a big, fat man," thought
939987 [39788] Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream
939987 [39789] indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
939987 [39790] 
939987 [39791] As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of
939987 [39792] something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite
939987 [39793] seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently
939987 [39794] and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror
939987 [39795] at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every
939987 [39796] minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem
939987 [39797] possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the
939987 [39798] fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him
939987 [39799] again. "I shall fall down!" flashed through his mind, but the unknown
939987 [39800] began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
939987 [39801] 
939987 [39802] "What's up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!" he bawled in a
939987 [39803] thick voice, "Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,
939987 [39804] my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?"
939987 [39805] 
939987 [39806] And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at
939987 [39807] the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate
939987 [39808] acquaintance.
939987 [39809] 
939987 [39810] At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the
939987 [39811] stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at
939987 [39812] first.
939987 [39813] 
939987 [39814] "You don't say there's no one at home," the new-comer cried in a
939987 [39815] cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on
939987 [39816] pulling the bell. "Good evening, Koch."
939987 [39817] 
939987 [39818] "From his voice he must be quite young," thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [39819] 
939987 [39820] "Who the devil can tell? I've almost broken the lock," answered Koch.
939987 [39821] "But how do you come to know me?"
939987 [39822] 
939987 [39823] "Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at
939987 [39824] billiards at Gambrinus'."
939987 [39825] 
939987 [39826] "Oh!"
939987 [39827] 
939987 [39828] "So they are not at home? That's queer. It's awfully stupid though.
939987 [39829] Where could the old woman have gone? I've come on business."
939987 [39830] 
939987 [39831] "Yes; and I have business with her, too."
939987 [39832] 
939987 [39833] "Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to
939987 [39834] get some money!" cried the young man.
939987 [39835] 
939987 [39836] "We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The
939987 [39837] old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It's out of my way.
939987 [39838] And where the devil she can have got to, I can't make out. She sits here
939987 [39839] from year's end to year's end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet
939987 [39840] here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!"
939987 [39841] 
939987 [39842] "Hadn't we better ask the porter?"
939987 [39843] 
939987 [39844] "What?"
939987 [39845] 
939987 [39846] "Where she's gone and when she'll be back."
939987 [39847] 
939987 [39848] "Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go
939987 [39849] anywhere."
939987 [39850] 
939987 [39851] And he once more tugged at the door-handle.
939987 [39852] 
939987 [39853] "Damn it all. There's nothing to be done, we must go!"
939987 [39854] 
939987 [39855] "Stay!" cried the young man suddenly. "Do you see how the door shakes if
939987 [39856] you pull it?"
939987 [39857] 
939987 [39858] "Well?"
939987 [39859] 
939987 [39860] "That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how
939987 [39861] the hook clanks?"
939987 [39862] 
939987 [39863] "Well?"
939987 [39864] 
939987 [39865] "Why, don't you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they
939987 [39866] were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the
939987 [39867] key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook
939987 [39868] is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,
939987 [39869] don't you see. So there they are sitting inside and don't open the
939987 [39870] door!"
939987 [39871] 
939987 [39872] "Well! And so they must be!" cried Koch, astonished. "What are they
939987 [39873] about in there?" And he began furiously shaking the door.
939987 [39874] 
939987 [39875] "Stay!" cried the young man again. "Don't pull at it! There must be
939987 [39876] something wrong.... Here, you've been ringing and pulling at the door
939987 [39877] and still they don't open! So either they've both fainted or..."
939987 [39878] 
939987 [39879] "What?"
939987 [39880] 
939987 [39881] "I tell you what. Let's go fetch the porter, let him wake them up."
939987 [39882] 
939987 [39883] "All right."
939987 [39884] 
939987 [39885] Both were going down.
939987 [39886] 
939987 [39887] "Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter."
939987 [39888] 
939987 [39889] "What for?"
939987 [39890] 
939987 [39891] "Well, you'd better."
939987 [39892] 
939987 [39893] "All right."
939987 [39894] 
939987 [39895] "I'm studying the law you see! It's evident, e-vi-dent there's something
939987 [39896] wrong here!" the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.
939987 [39897] 
939987 [39898] Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one
939987 [39899] tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began
939987 [39900] touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once
939987 [39901] more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he
939987 [39902] bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock
939987 [39903] on the inside and so nothing could be seen.
939987 [39904] 
939987 [39905] Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of
939987 [39906] delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
939987 [39907] While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times
939987 [39908] occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the
939987 [39909] door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,
939987 [39910] while they could not open the door! "Only make haste!" was the thought
939987 [39911] that flashed through his mind.
939987 [39912] 
939987 [39913] "But what the devil is he about?..." Time was passing, one minute, and
939987 [39914] another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.
939987 [39915] 
939987 [39916] "What the devil?" he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his
939987 [39917] sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy
939987 [39918] boots on the stairs. The steps died away.
939987 [39919] 
939987 [39920] "Good heavens! What am I to do?"
939987 [39921] 
939987 [39922] Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.
939987 [39923] Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as
939987 [39924] thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.
939987 [39925] 
939987 [39926] He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice
939987 [39927] below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going
939987 [39928] back to the flat.
939987 [39929] 
939987 [39930] "Hey there! Catch the brute!"
939987 [39931] 
939987 [39932] Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran
939987 [39933] down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.
939987 [39934] 
939987 [39935] "Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!"
939987 [39936] 
939987 [39937] The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was
939987 [39938] still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began
939987 [39939] noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He
939987 [39940] distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. "Hey!"
939987 [39941] 
939987 [39942] Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling "come what
939987 [39943] must!" If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was
939987 [39944] lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only
939987 [39945] a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the
939987 [39946] right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the
939987 [39947] second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though
939987 [39948] for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just
939987 [39949] run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle
939987 [39950] of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one
939987 [39951] instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall
939987 [39952] and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
939987 [39953] Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He
939987 [39954] waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.
939987 [39955] 
939987 [39956] No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through
939987 [39957] the gateway and turned to the left in the street.
939987 [39958] 
939987 [39959] He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the
939987 [39960] flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as
939987 [39961] the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the
939987 [39962] bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and
939987 [39963] completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had
939987 [39964] succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would
939987 [39965] guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were
939987 [39966] going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though
939987 [39967] the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. "Should he
939987 [39968] slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,
939987 [39969] hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,
939987 [39970] hopeless!"
939987 [39971] 
939987 [39972] At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.
939987 [39973] Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky
939987 [39974] because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a
939987 [39975] grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could
939987 [39976] scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.
939987 [39977] "My word, he has been going it!" someone shouted at him when he came out
939987 [39978] on the canal bank.
939987 [39979] 
939987 [39980] He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the
939987 [39981] worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal
939987 [39982] bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more
939987 [39983] conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost
939987 [39984] falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from
939987 [39985] quite a different direction.
939987 [39986] 
939987 [39987] He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his
939987 [39988] house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
939987 [39989] And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to
939987 [39990] escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course
939987 [39991] incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to
939987 [39992] restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's yard. But
939987 [39993] it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter's room was closed
939987 [39994] but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at
939987 [39995] home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he
939987 [39996] walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,
939987 [39997] "What do you want?" he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But
939987 [39998] again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe
939987 [39999] back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as
939987 [40000] before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;
939987 [40001] the landlady's door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself
939987 [40002] on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank
939987 [40003] forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have
939987 [40004] jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were
939987 [40005] simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could
939987 [40006] not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....
939987 [40007] 
939987 [40008] 
939987 [40009] 
939987 [40010] 
939987 [40011] PART II
939987 [40012] 
939987 [40013] 
939987 [40014] 
939987 [40015] CHAPTER I
939987 [40016] 
939987 [40017] So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at
939987 [40018] such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not
939987 [40019] occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get
939987 [40020] light. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.
939987 [40021] Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he
939987 [40022] heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o'clock. They woke
939987 [40023] him up now.
939987 [40024] 
939987 [40025] "Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it's
939987 [40026] past two o'clock," and at once he leaped up, as though someone had
939987 [40027] pulled him from the sofa.
939987 [40028] 
939987 [40029] "What! Past two o'clock!"
939987 [40030] 
939987 [40031] He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at
939987 [40032] once, in one flash, he recollected everything.
939987 [40033] 
939987 [40034] For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came
939987 [40035] over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in
939987 [40036] his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his
939987 [40037] teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and
939987 [40038] began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he
939987 [40039] gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he
939987 [40040] could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have
939987 [40041] flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his
939987 [40042] hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.
939987 [40043] 
939987 [40044] "If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I'm drunk
939987 [40045] but..."
939987 [40046] 
939987 [40047] He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly
939987 [40048] looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there
939987 [40049] no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he
939987 [40050] began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything
939987 [40051] over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through
939987 [40052] his search three times.
939987 [40053] 
939987 [40054] But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where
939987 [40055] some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge
939987 [40056] of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed
939987 [40057] threads. There seemed to be nothing more.
939987 [40058] 
939987 [40059] Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of
939987 [40060] the old woman's box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till
939987 [40061] then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them
939987 [40062] while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed
939987 [40063] to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out
939987 [40064] everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was
939987 [40065] nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had
939987 [40066] come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began
939987 [40067] stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: "They're in! All
939987 [40068] out of sight, and the purse too!" he thought gleefully, getting up and
939987 [40069] gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly
939987 [40070] he shuddered all over with horror; "My God!" he whispered in despair:
939987 [40071] "what's the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide
939987 [40072] things?"
939987 [40073] 
939987 [40074] He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of
939987 [40075] money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.
939987 [40076] 
939987 [40077] "But now, now, what am I glad of?" he thought, "Is that hiding things?
939987 [40078] My reason's deserting me--simply!"
939987 [40079] 
939987 [40080] He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another
939987 [40081] unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside
939987 [40082] him his old student's winter coat, which was still warm though almost in
939987 [40083] rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and
939987 [40084] delirium. He lost consciousness.
939987 [40085] 
939987 [40086] Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,
939987 [40087] and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.
939987 [40088] 
939987 [40089] "How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not
939987 [40090] taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!
939987 [40091] Such a piece of evidence!"
939987 [40092] 
939987 [40093] He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits
939987 [40094] among his linen under the pillow.
939987 [40095] 
939987 [40096] "Pieces of torn linen couldn't rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I
939987 [40097] think not, I think not, any way!" he repeated, standing in the middle
939987 [40098] of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about
939987 [40099] him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not
939987 [40100] forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,
939987 [40101] and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an
939987 [40102] insufferable torture.
939987 [40103] 
939987 [40104] "Surely it isn't beginning already! Surely it isn't my punishment coming
939987 [40105] upon me? It is!"
939987 [40106] 
939987 [40107] The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the
939987 [40108] floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!
939987 [40109] 
939987 [40110] "What is the matter with me!" he cried again, like one distraught.
939987 [40111] 
939987 [40112] Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes
939987 [40113] were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many
939987 [40114] stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because
939987 [40115] his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was
939987 [40116] clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the
939987 [40117] purse too. "Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put
939987 [40118] the wet purse in my pocket!"
939987 [40119] 
939987 [40120] In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were
939987 [40121] traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
939987 [40122] 
939987 [40123] "So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and
939987 [40124] memory, since I guessed it of myself," he thought triumphantly, with
939987 [40125] a deep sigh of relief; "it's simply the weakness of fever, a moment's
939987 [40126] delirium," and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his
939987 [40127] trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the
939987 [40128] sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He
939987 [40129] flung off his boots; "traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with
939987 [40130] blood;" he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... "But what am I
939987 [40131] to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?"
939987 [40132] 
939987 [40133] He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the
939987 [40134] room.
939987 [40135] 
939987 [40136] "In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?
939987 [40137] But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better
939987 [40138] go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away," he
939987 [40139] repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, "and at once, this minute,
939987 [40140] without lingering..."
939987 [40141] 
939987 [40142] But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy
939987 [40143] shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.
939987 [40144] 
939987 [40145] And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to
939987 [40146] "go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that
939987 [40147] it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!" Several times
939987 [40148] he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.
939987 [40149] 
939987 [40150] He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.
939987 [40151] 
939987 [40152] "Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!" shouted
939987 [40153] Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. "For whole days together
939987 [40154] he's snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It's
939987 [40155] past ten."
939987 [40156] 
939987 [40157] "Maybe he's not at home," said a man's voice.
939987 [40158] 
939987 [40159] "Ha! that's the porter's voice.... What does he want?"
939987 [40160] 
939987 [40161] He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a
939987 [40162] positive pain.
939987 [40163] 
939987 [40164] "Then who can have latched the door?" retorted Nastasya. "He's taken to
939987 [40165] bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake
939987 [40166] up!"
939987 [40167] 
939987 [40168] "What do they want? Why the porter? All's discovered. Resist or open?
939987 [40169] Come what may!..."
939987 [40170] 
939987 [40171] He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
939987 [40172] 
939987 [40173] His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the
939987 [40174] bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.
939987 [40175] 
939987 [40176] Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and
939987 [40177] desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded
939987 [40178] paper sealed with bottle-wax.
939987 [40179] 
939987 [40180] "A notice from the office," he announced, as he gave him the paper.
939987 [40181] 
939987 [40182] "From what office?"
939987 [40183] 
939987 [40184] "A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office."
939987 [40185] 
939987 [40186] "To the police?... What for?..."
939987 [40187] 
939987 [40188] "How can I tell? You're sent for, so you go."
939987 [40189] 
939987 [40190] The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to
939987 [40191] go away.
939987 [40192] 
939987 [40193] "He's downright ill!" observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.
939987 [40194] The porter turned his head for a moment. "He's been in a fever since
939987 [40195] yesterday," she added.
939987 [40196] 
939987 [40197] Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without
939987 [40198] opening it. "Don't you get up then," Nastasya went on compassionately,
939987 [40199] seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. "You're ill, and
939987 [40200] so don't go; there's no such hurry. What have you got there?"
939987 [40201] 
939987 [40202] He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his
939987 [40203] trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep
939987 [40204] with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that
939987 [40205] half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand
939987 [40206] and so fallen asleep again.
939987 [40207] 
939987 [40208] "Look at the rags he's collected and sleeps with them, as though he has
939987 [40209] got hold of a treasure..."
939987 [40210] 
939987 [40211] And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.
939987 [40212] 
939987 [40213] Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his
939987 [40214] eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational
939987 [40215] reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that
939987 [40216] with a person who was going to be arrested. "But... the police?"
939987 [40217] 
939987 [40218] "You'd better have some tea! Yes? I'll bring it, there's some left."
939987 [40219] 
939987 [40220] "No... I'm going; I'll go at once," he muttered, getting on to his feet.
939987 [40221] 
939987 [40222] "Why, you'll never get downstairs!"
939987 [40223] 
939987 [40224] "Yes, I'll go."
939987 [40225] 
939987 [40226] "As you please."
939987 [40227] 
939987 [40228] She followed the porter out.
939987 [40229] 
939987 [40230] At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
939987 [40231] 
939987 [40232] "There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,
939987 [40233] and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could
939987 [40234] distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,
939987 [40235] thank God!" Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began
939987 [40236] reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an
939987 [40237] ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at
939987 [40238] half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.
939987 [40239] 
939987 [40240] "But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with
939987 [40241] the police! And why just to-day?" he thought in agonising bewilderment.
939987 [40242] "Good God, only get it over soon!"
939987 [40243] 
939987 [40244] He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into
939987 [40245] laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
939987 [40246] 
939987 [40247] He began, hurriedly dressing. "If I'm lost, I am lost, I don't care!
939987 [40248] Shall I put the sock on?" he suddenly wondered, "it will get dustier
939987 [40249] still and the traces will be gone."
939987 [40250] 
939987 [40251] But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing
939987 [40252] and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,
939987 [40253] he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.
939987 [40254] 
939987 [40255] "That's all conventional, that's all relative, merely a way of looking
939987 [40256] at it," he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his
939987 [40257] mind, while he was shuddering all over, "there, I've got it on! I have
939987 [40258] finished by getting it on!"
939987 [40259] 
939987 [40260] But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.
939987 [40261] 
939987 [40262] "No, it's too much for me..." he thought. His legs shook. "From fear,"
939987 [40263] he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. "It's a trick! They
939987 [40264] want to decoy me there and confound me over everything," he mused, as
939987 [40265] he went out on to the stairs--"the worst of it is I'm almost
939987 [40266] light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid..."
939987 [40267] 
939987 [40268] On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as
939987 [40269] they were in the hole in the wall, "and very likely, it's on purpose
939987 [40270] to search when I'm out," he thought, and stopped short. But he was
939987 [40271] possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call
939987 [40272] it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. "Only to get it over!"
939987 [40273] 
939987 [40274] In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had
939987 [40275] fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench
939987 [40276] from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish
939987 [40277] pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,
939987 [40278] so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going
939987 [40279] round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the
939987 [40280] street on a bright sunny day.
939987 [40281] 
939987 [40282] When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of
939987 [40283] trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted
939987 [40284] his eyes.
939987 [40285] 
939987 [40286] "If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell," he thought, as he drew
939987 [40287] near the police-station.
939987 [40288] 
939987 [40289] The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been
939987 [40290] moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once
939987 [40291] for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,
939987 [40292] he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with
939987 [40293] a book in his hand. "A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is
939987 [40294] here," and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want
939987 [40295] to ask questions of anyone.
939987 [40296] 
939987 [40297] "I'll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything..." he thought, as
939987 [40298] he reached the fourth floor.
939987 [40299] 
939987 [40300] The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The
939987 [40301] kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost
939987 [40302] the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase
939987 [40303] was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their
939987 [40304] arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of
939987 [40305] the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,
939987 [40306] too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh
939987 [40307] paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.
939987 [40308] 
939987 [40309] After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.
939987 [40310] All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him
939987 [40311] on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some
939987 [40312] clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a
939987 [40313] queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.
939987 [40314] 
939987 [40315] "What is it?"
939987 [40316] 
939987 [40317] He showed the notice he had received.
939987 [40318] 
939987 [40319] "You are a student?" the man asked, glancing at the notice.
939987 [40320] 
939987 [40321] "Yes, formerly a student."
939987 [40322] 
939987 [40323] The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a
939987 [40324] particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.
939987 [40325] 
939987 [40326] "There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no
939987 [40327] interest in anything," thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [40328] 
939987 [40329] "Go in there to the head clerk," said the clerk, pointing towards the
939987 [40330] furthest room.
939987 [40331] 
939987 [40332] He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and
939987 [40333] packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
939987 [40334] Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the
939987 [40335] table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.
939987 [40336] The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,
939987 [40337] excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a
939987 [40338] saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
939987 [40339] Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced
939987 [40340] at it, said: "Wait a minute," and went on attending to the lady in
939987 [40341] mourning.
939987 [40342] 
939987 [40343] He breathed more freely. "It can't be that!"
939987 [40344] 
939987 [40345] By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have
939987 [40346] courage and be calm.
939987 [40347] 
939987 [40348] "Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!
939987 [40349] Hm... it's a pity there's no air here," he added, "it's stifling.... It
939987 [40350] makes one's head dizzier than ever... and one's mind too..."
939987 [40351] 
939987 [40352] He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing
939987 [40353] his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,
939987 [40354] something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet
939987 [40355] the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him
939987 [40356] and guess something from his face.
939987 [40357] 
939987 [40358] He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile
939987 [40359] face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and
939987 [40360] foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,
939987 [40361] and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain
939987 [40362] on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who
939987 [40363] was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
939987 [40364] 
939987 [40365] "Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down," he said casually to the
939987 [40366] gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not
939987 [40367] venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.
939987 [40368] 
939987 [40369] "Ich danke," said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank
939987 [40370] into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated
939987 [40371] about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She
939987 [40372] smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half
939987 [40373] the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was
939987 [40374] impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
939987 [40375] 
939987 [40376] The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with
939987 [40377] some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of
939987 [40378] his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and
939987 [40379] sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her
939987 [40380] seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the
939987 [40381] officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to
939987 [40382] sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He
939987 [40383] had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his
939987 [40384] face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except
939987 [40385] a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at
939987 [40386] Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his
939987 [40387] humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his
939987 [40388] clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on
939987 [40389] him, so that he felt positively affronted.
939987 [40390] 
939987 [40391] "What do you want?" he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged
939987 [40392] fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.
939987 [40393] 
939987 [40394] "I was summoned... by a notice..." Raskolnikov faltered.
939987 [40395] 
939987 [40396] "For the recovery of money due, from _the student_," the head clerk
939987 [40397] interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. "Here!" and he
939987 [40398] flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. "Read that!"
939987 [40399] 
939987 [40400] "Money? What money?" thought Raskolnikov, "but... then... it's certainly
939987 [40401] not _that_."
939987 [40402] 
939987 [40403] And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A
939987 [40404] load was lifted from his back.
939987 [40405] 
939987 [40406] "And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?" shouted the
939987 [40407] assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more
939987 [40408] aggrieved. "You are told to come at nine, and now it's twelve!"
939987 [40409] 
939987 [40410] "The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikov
939987 [40411] answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew
939987 [40412] suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. "And it's enough that
939987 [40413] I have come here ill with fever."
939987 [40414] 
939987 [40415] "Kindly refrain from shouting!"
939987 [40416] 
939987 [40417] "I'm not shouting, I'm speaking very quietly, it's you who are shouting
939987 [40418] at me. I'm a student, and allow no one to shout at me."
939987 [40419] 
939987 [40420] The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he
939987 [40421] could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.
939987 [40422] 
939987 [40423] "Be silent! You are in a government office. Don't be impudent, sir!"
939987 [40424] 
939987 [40425] "You're in a government office, too," cried Raskolnikov, "and you're
939987 [40426] smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect
939987 [40427] to all of us."
939987 [40428] 
939987 [40429] He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
939987 [40430] 
939987 [40431] The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant
939987 [40432] superintendent was obviously disconcerted.
939987 [40433] 
939987 [40434] "That's not your business!" he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.
939987 [40435] "Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr
939987 [40436] Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don't pay your
939987 [40437] debts! You're a fine bird!"
939987 [40438] 
939987 [40439] But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the
939987 [40440] paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second
939987 [40441] time, and still did not understand.
939987 [40442] 
939987 [40443] "What is this?" he asked the head clerk.
939987 [40444] 
939987 [40445] "It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must
939987 [40446] either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written
939987 [40447] declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not
939987 [40448] to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your
939987 [40449] property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed
939987 [40450] against you according to the law."
939987 [40451] 
939987 [40452] "But I... am not in debt to anyone!"
939987 [40453] 
939987 [40454] "That's not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen
939987 [40455] roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us
939987 [40456] for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine
939987 [40457] months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.
939987 [40458] We therefore summon you, hereupon."
939987 [40459] 
939987 [40460] "But she is my landlady!"
939987 [40461] 
939987 [40462] "And what if she is your landlady?"
939987 [40463] 
939987 [40464] The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,
939987 [40465] and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire
939987 [40466] for the first time--as though he would say: "Well, how do you feel now?"
939987 [40467] But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that
939987 [40468] worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he
939987 [40469] read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but
939987 [40470] all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from
939987 [40471] overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment
939987 [40472] without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions
939987 [40473] or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant
939987 [40474] of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment
939987 [40475] something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant
939987 [40476] superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov's disrespect, still fuming
939987 [40477] and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the
939987 [40478] unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in
939987 [40479] with an exceedingly silly smile.
939987 [40480] 
939987 [40481] "You shameful hussy!" he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The
939987 [40482] lady in mourning had left the office.) "What was going on at your house
939987 [40483] last night? Eh! A disgrace again, you're a scandal to the whole street.
939987 [40484] Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,
939987 [40485] I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the
939987 [40486] eleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!"
939987 [40487] 
939987 [40488] The paper fell out of Raskolnikov's hands, and he looked wildly at the
939987 [40489] smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it
939987 [40490] meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He
939987 [40491] listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his
939987 [40492] nerves were on edge.
939987 [40493] 
939987 [40494] "Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped
939987 [40495] short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not
939987 [40496] be stopped except by force.
939987 [40497] 
939987 [40498] As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the
939987 [40499] storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of
939987 [40500] abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the
939987 [40501] smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and
939987 [40502] curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her
939987 [40503] word: and at last she found it.
939987 [40504] 
939987 [40505] "There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain," she
939987 [40506] pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,
939987 [40507] though with a strong German accent, "and no sort of scandal, and his
939987 [40508] honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,
939987 [40509] and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
939987 [40510] and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any
939987 [40511] scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles
939987 [40512] again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte
939987 [40513] with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and
939987 [40514] he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said
939987 [40515] so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then
939987 [40516] I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the
939987 [40517] eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the
939987 [40518] cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
939987 [40519] and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in
939987 [40520] the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of
939987 [40521] squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!
939987 [40522] And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,
939987 [40523] Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_
939987 [40524] pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five
939987 [40525] roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused
939987 [40526] all the scandal. 'I will show you up,' he said, 'for I can write to all
939987 [40527] the papers about you.'"
939987 [40528] 
939987 [40529] "Then he was an author?"
939987 [40530] 
939987 [40531] "Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable
939987 [40532] house...."
939987 [40533] 
939987 [40534] "Now then! Enough! I have told you already..."
939987 [40535] 
939987 [40536] "Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk repeated significantly.
939987 [40537] 
939987 [40538] The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his
939987 [40539] head.
939987 [40540] 
939987 [40541] "... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it
939987 [40542] you for the last time," the assistant went on. "If there is a scandal
939987 [40543] in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the
939987 [40544] lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary
939987 [40545] man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an 'honourable
939987 [40546] house'? A nice set, these authors!"
939987 [40547] 
939987 [40548] And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. "There was a scandal
939987 [40549] the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and
939987 [40550] would not pay; 'I'll write a satire on you,' says he. And there was
939987 [40551] another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful
939987 [40552] language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and
939987 [40553] daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner's shop
939987 [40554] the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,
939987 [40555] town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one
939987 [40556] day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?"
939987 [40557] 
939987 [40558] With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all
939987 [40559] directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she
939987 [40560] stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open
939987 [40561] face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of
939987 [40562] the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste
939987 [40563] to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she
939987 [40564] fluttered out of the office.
939987 [40565] 
939987 [40566] "Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!" said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya
939987 [40567] Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. "You are aroused again, you are
939987 [40568] fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!"
939987 [40569] 
939987 [40570] "Well, what then!" Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;
939987 [40571] and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of
939987 [40572] his shoulders at each step. "Here, if you will kindly look: an author,
939987 [40573] or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given
939987 [40574] an I O U, won't clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly
939987 [40575] being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest
939987 [40576] against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and
939987 [40577] just look at him, please. Here's the gentleman, and very attractive he
939987 [40578] is!"
939987 [40579] 
939987 [40580] "Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,
939987 [40581] you can't bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and
939987 [40582] went too far yourself," continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to
939987 [40583] Raskolnikov. "But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure
939987 [40584] you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no
939987 [40585] stopping him! And then it's all over! And at the bottom he's a heart of
939987 [40586] gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant...."
939987 [40587] 
939987 [40588] "And what a regiment it was, too," cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified
939987 [40589] at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.
939987 [40590] 
939987 [40591] Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant
939987 [40592] to them all. "Excuse me, Captain," he began easily, suddenly addressing
939987 [40593] Nikodim Fomitch, "will you enter into my position?... I am ready to
939987 [40594] ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick
939987 [40595] and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not
939987 [40596] studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I
939987 [40597] have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to
939987 [40598] me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so
939987 [40599] exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the
939987 [40600] last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I
939987 [40601] don't understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this
939987 [40602] I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!..."
939987 [40603] 
939987 [40604] "But that is not our business, you know," the head clerk was observing.
939987 [40605] 
939987 [40606] "Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain..."
939987 [40607] Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying
939987 [40608] his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently
939987 [40609] appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously
939987 [40610] oblivious of him. "Allow me to explain that I have been living with her
939987 [40611] for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not
939987 [40612] confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it
939987 [40613] was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked
939987 [40614] her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...
939987 [40615] that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those
939987 [40616] days, and I led a life of... I was very heedless..."
939987 [40617] 
939987 [40618] "Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we've no time to
939987 [40619] waste," Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;
939987 [40620] but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it
939987 [40621] exceedingly difficult to speak.
939987 [40622] 
939987 [40623] "But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all
939987 [40624] happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
939987 [40625] But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as
939987 [40626] before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said
939987 [40627] to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,
939987 [40628] but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen
939987 [40629] roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,
939987 [40630] she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,
939987 [40631] never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay
939987 [40632] of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to
939987 [40633] eat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?"
939987 [40634] 
939987 [40635] "All these affecting details are no business of ours." Ilya Petrovitch
939987 [40636] interrupted rudely. "You must give a written undertaking but as for your
939987 [40637] love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with
939987 [40638] that."
939987 [40639] 
939987 [40640] "Come now... you are harsh," muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at
939987 [40641] the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.
939987 [40642] 
939987 [40643] "Write!" said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.
939987 [40644] 
939987 [40645] "Write what?" the latter asked, gruffly.
939987 [40646] 
939987 [40647] "I will dictate to you."
939987 [40648] 
939987 [40649] Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and
939987 [40650] contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt
939987 [40651] completely indifferent to anyone's opinion, and this revulsion took
939987 [40652] place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,
939987 [40653] he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like
939987 [40654] that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had
939987 [40655] those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not
939987 [40656] with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he
939987 [40657] would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A
939987 [40658] gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took
939987 [40659] conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental
939987 [40660] effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter's
939987 [40661] triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.
939987 [40662] Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty
939987 [40663] vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been
939987 [40664] sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would
939987 [40665] hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to
939987 [40666] him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but
939987 [40667] he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could
939987 [40668] never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental
939987 [40669] effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that
939987 [40670] if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,
939987 [40671] it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any
939987 [40672] circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful
939987 [40673] sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a
939987 [40674] conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the
939987 [40675] sensations he had known in his life.
939987 [40676] 
939987 [40677] The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,
939987 [40678] that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that
939987 [40679] he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.
939987 [40680] 
939987 [40681] "But you can't write, you can hardly hold the pen," observed the head
939987 [40682] clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. "Are you ill?"
939987 [40683] 
939987 [40684] "Yes, I am giddy. Go on!"
939987 [40685] 
939987 [40686] "That's all. Sign it."
939987 [40687] 
939987 [40688] The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.
939987 [40689] 
939987 [40690] Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,
939987 [40691] he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He
939987 [40692] felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea
939987 [40693] suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim
939987 [40694] Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then
939987 [40695] to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole
939987 [40696] in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat
939987 [40697] to carry it out. "Hadn't I better think a minute?" flashed through his
939987 [40698] mind. "No, better cast off the burden without thinking." But all at once
939987 [40699] he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly
939987 [40700] with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:
939987 [40701] 
939987 [40702] "It's impossible, they'll both be released. To begin with, the whole
939987 [40703] story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it
939987 [40704] had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,
939987 [40705] that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at
939987 [40706] the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking
939987 [40707] with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the
939987 [40708] porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he
939987 [40709] have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for
939987 [40710] Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith's below, before he went
939987 [40711] up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now
939987 [40712] just consider..."
939987 [40713] 
939987 [40714] "But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state
939987 [40715] themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes
939987 [40716] later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was
939987 [40717] unfastened."
939987 [40718] 
939987 [40719] "That's just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself
939987 [40720] in; and they'd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been
939987 [40721] an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the
939987 [40722] interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing
939987 [40723] himself and saying: 'If I had been there, he would have jumped out and
939987 [40724] killed me with his axe.' He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,
939987 [40725] ha!"
939987 [40726] 
939987 [40727] "And no one saw the murderer?"
939987 [40728] 
939987 [40729] "They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah's Ark," said
939987 [40730] the head clerk, who was listening.
939987 [40731] 
939987 [40732] "It's clear, quite clear," Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.
939987 [40733] 
939987 [40734] "No, it is anything but clear," Ilya Petrovitch maintained.
939987 [40735] 
939987 [40736] Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did
939987 [40737] not reach it....
939987 [40738] 
939987 [40739] When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,
939987 [40740] supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing
939987 [40741] on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and
939987 [40742] Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up
939987 [40743] from the chair.
939987 [40744] 
939987 [40745] "What's this? Are you ill?" Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.
939987 [40746] 
939987 [40747] "He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing," said the head clerk,
939987 [40748] settling back in his place, and taking up his work again.
939987 [40749] 
939987 [40750] "Have you been ill long?" cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where
939987 [40751] he, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at
939987 [40752] the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.
939987 [40753] 
939987 [40754] "Since yesterday," muttered Raskolnikov in reply.
939987 [40755] 
939987 [40756] "Did you go out yesterday?"
939987 [40757] 
939987 [40758] "Yes."
939987 [40759] 
939987 [40760] "Though you were ill?"
939987 [40761] 
939987 [40762] "Yes."
939987 [40763] 
939987 [40764] "At what time?"
939987 [40765] 
939987 [40766] "About seven."
939987 [40767] 
939987 [40768] "And where did you go, my I ask?"
939987 [40769] 
939987 [40770] "Along the street."
939987 [40771] 
939987 [40772] "Short and clear."
939987 [40773] 
939987 [40774] Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,
939987 [40775] without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch's stare.
939987 [40776] 
939987 [40777] "He can scarcely stand upright. And you..." Nikodim Fomitch was
939987 [40778] beginning.
939987 [40779] 
939987 [40780] "No matter," Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.
939987 [40781] 
939987 [40782] Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at
939987 [40783] the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There
939987 [40784] was a sudden silence. It was strange.
939987 [40785] 
939987 [40786] "Very well, then," concluded Ilya Petrovitch, "we will not detain you."
939987 [40787] 
939987 [40788] Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
939987 [40789] departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim
939987 [40790] Fomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.
939987 [40791] 
939987 [40792] "A search--there will be a search at once," he repeated to himself,
939987 [40793] hurrying home. "The brutes! they suspect."
939987 [40794] 
939987 [40795] His former terror mastered him completely again.
939987 [40796] 
939987 [40797] 
939987 [40798] 
939987 [40799] CHAPTER II
939987 [40800] 
939987 [40801] "And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my
939987 [40802] room?"
939987 [40803] 
939987 [40804] But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.
939987 [40805] Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left
939987 [40806] all those things in the hole?
939987 [40807] 
939987 [40808] He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the
939987 [40809] things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in
939987 [40810] all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly
939987 [40811] looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,
939987 [40812] merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked
939987 [40813] like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his
939987 [40814] overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal
939987 [40815] them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of
939987 [40816] his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and
939987 [40817] though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of
939987 [40818] pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an
939987 [40819] hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at
939987 [40820] all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything
939987 [40821] up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....
939987 [40822] Where was he to go?
939987 [40823] 
939987 [40824] That had long been settled: "Fling them into the canal, and all traces
939987 [40825] hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end." So he had decided in
939987 [40826] the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to
939987 [40827] get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get
939987 [40828] rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along
939987 [40829] the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked
939987 [40830] several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not
939987 [40831] think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge,
939987 [40832] and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and
939987 [40833] people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed
939987 [40834] from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go
939987 [40835] down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if
939987 [40836] the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.
939987 [40837] Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if
939987 [40838] they had nothing to do but to watch him. "Why is it, or can it be my
939987 [40839] fancy?" he thought.
939987 [40840] 
939987 [40841] At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
939987 [40842] Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,
939987 [40843] and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further
939987 [40844] off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,
939987 [40845] worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it
939987 [40846] before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply
939987 [40847] because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent
939987 [40848] and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.
939987 [40849] 
939987 [40850] He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way
939987 [40851] another idea struck him. "Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go
939987 [40852] somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things
939987 [40853] in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot
939987 [40854] perhaps?" And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea
939987 [40855] seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For
939987 [40856] coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a
939987 [40857] passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right
939987 [40858] hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far
939987 [40859] into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for
939987 [40860] twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here
939987 [40861] was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was
939987 [40862] lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,
939987 [40863] apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It
939987 [40864] was probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole place
939987 [40865] from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to
939987 [40866] throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and
939987 [40867] at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where
939987 [40868] there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had
939987 [40869] been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, "Standing here
939987 [40870] strictly forbidden." This was all the better, for there would be nothing
939987 [40871] suspicious about his going in. "Here I could throw it all in a heap and
939987 [40872] get away!"
939987 [40873] 
939987 [40874] Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed
939987 [40875] against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn
939987 [40876] stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a
939987 [40877] street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he
939987 [40878] could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the
939987 [40879] street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.
939987 [40880] 
939987 [40881] He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,
939987 [40882] and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small
939987 [40883] hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.
939987 [40884] The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he
939987 [40885] seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was
939987 [40886] in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But
939987 [40887] he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.
939987 [40888] Nothing could be noticed.
939987 [40889] 
939987 [40890] Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,
939987 [40891] almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in
939987 [40892] the police-office. "I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of
939987 [40893] looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since
939987 [40894] the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were
939987 [40895] found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!" And he laughed.
939987 [40896] Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless
939987 [40897] laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But
939987 [40898] when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come
939987 [40899] upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his
939987 [40900] mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat
939987 [40901] on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it
939987 [40902] would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had
939987 [40903] given the twenty copecks: "Damn him!"
939987 [40904] 
939987 [40905] He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now
939987 [40906] seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there
939987 [40907] really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that
939987 [40908] point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.
939987 [40909] 
939987 [40910] "Damn it all!" he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.
939987 [40911] "If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how
939987 [40912] stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned
939987 [40913] upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I
939987 [40914] care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It
939987 [40915] is not that at all!"
939987 [40916] 
939987 [40917] Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple
939987 [40918] question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.
939987 [40919] 
939987 [40920] "If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if
939987 [40921] I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even
939987 [40922] glance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I have
939987 [40923] undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,
939987 [40924] filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the
939987 [40925] water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen
939987 [40926] either... how's that?"
939987 [40927] 
939987 [40928] Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and
939987 [40929] it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night
939987 [40930] without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though
939987 [40931] it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and
939987 [40932] understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the
939987 [40933] moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out
939987 [40934] of it.... Yes, so it was.
939987 [40935] 
939987 [40936] "It is because I am very ill," he decided grimly at last, "I have been
939987 [40937] worrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing....
939987 [40938] Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been
939987 [40939] worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what
939987 [40940] if I don't get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!"
939987 [40941] 
939987 [40942] He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some
939987 [40943] distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new
939987 [40944] overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him
939987 [40945] every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for
939987 [40946] everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.
939987 [40947] All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their
939987 [40948] movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he
939987 [40949] might have spat at him or bitten him....
939987 [40950] 
939987 [40951] He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near
939987 [40952] the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. "Why, he lives here, in that house,"
939987 [40953] he thought, "why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here
939987 [40954] it's the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;
939987 [40955] have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never
939987 [40956] mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the
939987 [40957] day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further
939987 [40958] now."
939987 [40959] 
939987 [40960] He went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor.
939987 [40961] 
939987 [40962] The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and
939987 [40963] he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each
939987 [40964] other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on
939987 [40965] his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.
939987 [40966] 
939987 [40967] "Is it you?" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a
939987 [40968] brief pause, he whistled. "As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've
939987 [40969] cut me out!" he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. "Come sit down,
939987 [40970] you are tired, I'll be bound."
939987 [40971] 
939987 [40972] And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was
939987 [40973] in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his
939987 [40974] visitor was ill.
939987 [40975] 
939987 [40976] "Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?" He began feeling his
939987 [40977] pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.
939987 [40978] 
939987 [40979] "Never mind," he said, "I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I
939987 [40980] wanted,... but I don't really want lessons...."
939987 [40981] 
939987 [40982] "But I say! You are delirious, you know!" Razumihin observed, watching
939987 [40983] him carefully.
939987 [40984] 
939987 [40985] "No, I am not."
939987 [40986] 
939987 [40987] Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to
939987 [40988] Razumihin's, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend
939987 [40989] face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all
939987 [40990] disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the
939987 [40991] wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at
939987 [40992] himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold.
939987 [40993] 
939987 [40994] "Good-bye," he said abruptly, and walked to the door.
939987 [40995] 
939987 [40996] "Stop, stop! You queer fish."
939987 [40997] 
939987 [40998] "I don't want to," said the other, again pulling away his hand.
939987 [40999] 
939987 [41000] "Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this
939987 [41001] is... almost insulting! I won't let you go like that."
939987 [41002] 
939987 [41003] "Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could
939987 [41004] help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I
939987 [41005] mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?
939987 [41006] Nothing at all... no one's services... no one's sympathy. I am by
939987 [41007] myself... alone. Come, that's enough. Leave me alone."
939987 [41008] 
939987 [41009] "Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all
939987 [41010] I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, but
939987 [41011] there's a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.
939987 [41012] I would not exchange him for five lessons. He's doing publishing of a
939987 [41013] kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they
939987 [41014] have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I
939987 [41015] was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!
939987 [41016] Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of
939987 [41017] anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of
939987 [41018] the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses
939987 [41019] the question, 'Is woman a human being?' And, of course, triumphantly
939987 [41020] proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a
939987 [41021] contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand
939987 [41022] these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous
939987 [41023] title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He
939987 [41024] pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles
939987 [41025] for the job, and I've had six already in advance. When we have finished
939987 [41026] this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of
939987 [41027] the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have
939987 [41028] marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was
939987 [41029] a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don't contradict him, hang him!
939987 [41030] Well, would you like to do the second signature of '_Is woman a human
939987 [41031] being?_' If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those
939987 [41032] are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in
939987 [41033] advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.
939987 [41034] And when you have finished the signature there will be another three
939987 [41035] roubles for you. And please don't think I am doing you a service; quite
939987 [41036] the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to
939987 [41037] begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly
939987 [41038] adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.
939987 [41039] The only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better.
939987 [41040] Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse. Will you take
939987 [41041] it?"
939987 [41042] 
939987 [41043] Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles
939987 [41044] and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
939987 [41045] But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the
939987 [41046] stairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German article
939987 [41047] and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
939987 [41048] 
939987 [41049] "Are you raving, or what?" Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.
939987 [41050] "What farce is this? You'll drive me crazy too... what did you come to
939987 [41051] see me for, damn you?"
939987 [41052] 
939987 [41053] "I don't want... translation," muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.
939987 [41054] 
939987 [41055] "Then what the devil do you want?" shouted Razumihin from above.
939987 [41056] Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
939987 [41057] 
939987 [41058] "Hey, there! Where are you living?"
939987 [41059] 
939987 [41060] No answer.
939987 [41061] 
939987 [41062] "Well, confound you then!"
939987 [41063] 
939987 [41064] But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky
939987 [41065] Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant
939987 [41066] incident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him
939987 [41067] a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under
939987 [41068] his horses' hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the
939987 [41069] railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle
939987 [41070] of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
939987 [41071] He heard laughter, of course.
939987 [41072] 
939987 [41073] "Serves him right!"
939987 [41074] 
939987 [41075] "A pickpocket I dare say."
939987 [41076] 
939987 [41077] "Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on
939987 [41078] purpose; and you have to answer for him."
939987 [41079] 
939987 [41080] "It's a regular profession, that's what it is."
939987 [41081] 
939987 [41082] But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered
939987 [41083] after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt
939987 [41084] someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman
939987 [41085] in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter
939987 [41086] wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.
939987 [41087] 
939987 [41088] "Take it, my good man, in Christ's name."
939987 [41089] 
939987 [41090] He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From
939987 [41091] his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar
939987 [41092] asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he
939987 [41093] doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.
939987 [41094] 
939987 [41095] He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and
939987 [41096] turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without
939987 [41097] a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the
939987 [41098] Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the
939987 [41099] bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,
939987 [41100] and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
939987 [41101] The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one
939987 [41102] uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood
939987 [41103] still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was
939987 [41104] especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had
939987 [41105] hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,
939987 [41106] gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at
939987 [41107] a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely
939987 [41108] cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered
939987 [41109] every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting
939987 [41110] himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled
939987 [41111] those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was
939987 [41112] no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and
939987 [41113] grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,
939987 [41114] as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be
939987 [41115] interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...
939987 [41116] so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his
939987 [41117] heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him
939987 [41118] now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,
939987 [41119] his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He
939987 [41120] felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing
939987 [41121] from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he
939987 [41122] suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his
939987 [41123] hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into
939987 [41124] the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut
939987 [41125] himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.
939987 [41126] 
939987 [41127] Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been
939987 [41128] walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.
939987 [41129] Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the
939987 [41130] sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....
939987 [41131] 
939987 [41132] It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a
939987 [41133] scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,
939987 [41134] blows and curses he had never heard.
939987 [41135] 
939987 [41136] He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he
939987 [41137] sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing
939987 [41138] and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement
939987 [41139] he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and
939987 [41140] wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make
939987 [41141] out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be
939987 [41142] beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of
939987 [41143] her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost
939987 [41144] a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly
939987 [41145] and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov
939987 [41146] trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.
939987 [41147] Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,
939987 [41148] banging her head against the steps--that's clear, that can be told
939987 [41149] from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world
939987 [41150] topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys
939987 [41151] and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors
939987 [41152] banging. "But why, why, and how could it be?" he repeated, thinking
939987 [41153] seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And
939987 [41154] they would come to him then next, "for no doubt... it's all about
939987 [41155] that... about yesterday.... Good God!" He would have fastened his door
939987 [41156] with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would
939987 [41157] be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed
939987 [41158] him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,
939987 [41159] began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya
939987 [41160] Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,
939987 [41161] too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. "Can he have
939987 [41162] gone away? Good Lord!" Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still
939987 [41163] weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was
939987 [41164] going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling
939987 [41165] to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a
939987 [41166] whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates
939987 [41167] of the block. "But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come
939987 [41168] here!"
939987 [41169] 
939987 [41170] Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He
939987 [41171] lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of
939987 [41172] infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright
939987 [41173] light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate
939987 [41174] of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not
939987 [41175] asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she
939987 [41176] had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
939987 [41177] 
939987 [41178] "You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudging
939987 [41179] about all day, and you're shaking with fever."
939987 [41180] 
939987 [41181] "Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?"
939987 [41182] 
939987 [41183] She looked intently at him.
939987 [41184] 
939987 [41185] "Who beat the landlady?"
939987 [41186] 
939987 [41187] "Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant
939987 [41188] superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,
939987 [41189] and... why was he here?"
939987 [41190] 
939987 [41191] Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a
939987 [41192] long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.
939987 [41193] 
939987 [41194] "Nastasya, why don't you speak?" he said timidly at last in a weak
939987 [41195] voice.
939987 [41196] 
939987 [41197] "It's the blood," she answered at last softly, as though speaking to
939987 [41198] herself.
939987 [41199] 
939987 [41200] "Blood? What blood?" he muttered, growing white and turning towards the
939987 [41201] wall.
939987 [41202] 
939987 [41203] Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.
939987 [41204] 
939987 [41205] "Nobody has been beating the landlady," she declared at last in a firm,
939987 [41206] resolute voice.
939987 [41207] 
939987 [41208] He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.
939987 [41209] 
939987 [41210] "I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up," he
939987 [41211] said still more timidly. "I listened a long while. The assistant
939987 [41212] superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the
939987 [41213] flats."
939987 [41214] 
939987 [41215] "No one has been here. That's the blood crying in your ears. When
939987 [41216] there's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying
939987 [41217] things.... Will you eat something?"
939987 [41218] 
939987 [41219] He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.
939987 [41220] 
939987 [41221] "Give me something to drink... Nastasya."
939987 [41222] 
939987 [41223] She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.
939987 [41224] He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling
939987 [41225] some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.
939987 [41226] 
939987 [41227] 
939987 [41228] 
939987 [41229] CHAPTER III
939987 [41230] 
939987 [41231] He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he
939987 [41232] was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
939987 [41233] He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though
939987 [41234] there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away
939987 [41235] somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about
939987 [41236] him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid
939987 [41237] of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;
939987 [41238] they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked
939987 [41239] at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished
939987 [41240] another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could
939987 [41241] not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.
939987 [41242] Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times
939987 [41243] it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had
939987 [41244] no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten
939987 [41245] something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying
939987 [41246] to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable
939987 [41247] terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone
939987 [41248] always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and
939987 [41249] forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.
939987 [41250] 
939987 [41251] It happened at ten o'clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone
939987 [41252] into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right
939987 [41253] wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him
939987 [41254] with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him
939987 [41255] very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,
939987 [41256] short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was
939987 [41257] peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.
939987 [41258] 
939987 [41259] "Who is this, Nastasya?" he asked, pointing to the young man.
939987 [41260] 
939987 [41261] "I say, he's himself again!" she said.
939987 [41262] 
939987 [41263] "He is himself," echoed the man.
939987 [41264] 
939987 [41265] Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the
939987 [41266] door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or
939987 [41267] discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat
939987 [41268] and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and
939987 [41269] laziness, and absurdly bashful.
939987 [41270] 
939987 [41271] "Who... are you?" he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment
939987 [41272] the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,
939987 [41273] Razumihin came in.
939987 [41274] 
939987 [41275] "What a cabin it is!" he cried. "I am always knocking my head. You call
939987 [41276] this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I've just heard the news
939987 [41277] from Pashenka."
939987 [41278] 
939987 [41279] "He has just come to," said Nastasya.
939987 [41280] 
939987 [41281] "Just come to," echoed the man again, with a smile.
939987 [41282] 
939987 [41283] "And who are you?" Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. "My name is
939987 [41284] Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but
939987 [41285] Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are
939987 [41286] you?"
939987 [41287] 
939987 [41288] "I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and
939987 [41289] I've come on business."
939987 [41290] 
939987 [41291] "Please sit down." Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the
939987 [41292] table. "It's a good thing you've come to, brother," he went on to
939987 [41293] Raskolnikov. "For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk
939987 [41294] anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see
939987 [41295] you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at
939987 [41296] once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.
939987 [41297] Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not
939987 [41298] had enough beer and radish, but it's nothing much, it will pass and you
939987 [41299] will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a
939987 [41300] name. Come, I won't keep you," he said, addressing the man again. "Will
939987 [41301] you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time
939987 [41302] they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I
939987 [41303] talked to him. Who was it came before?"
939987 [41304] 
939987 [41305] "That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,
939987 [41306] sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too."
939987 [41307] 
939987 [41308] "He was more intelligent than you, don't you think so?"
939987 [41309] 
939987 [41310] "Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am."
939987 [41311] 
939987 [41312] "Quite so; go on."
939987 [41313] 
939987 [41314] "At your mamma's request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom
939987 [41315] I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you
939987 [41316] from our office," the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. "If you are in
939987 [41317] an intelligible condition, I've thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as
939987 [41318] Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma's
939987 [41319] request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you
939987 [41320] know him, sir?"
939987 [41321] 
939987 [41322] "Yes, I remember... Vahrushin," Raskolnikov said dreamily.
939987 [41323] 
939987 [41324] "You hear, he knows Vahrushin," cried Razumihin. "He is in 'an
939987 [41325] intelligible condition'! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,
939987 [41326] it's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom."
939987 [41327] 
939987 [41328] "That's the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request
939987 [41329] of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the
939987 [41330] same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent
939987 [41331] instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you
939987 [41332] thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come."
939987 [41333] 
939987 [41334] "That 'hoping for better to come' is the best thing you've said, though
939987 [41335] 'your mamma' is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully
939987 [41336] conscious, eh?"
939987 [41337] 
939987 [41338] "That's all right. If only he can sign this little paper."
939987 [41339] 
939987 [41340] "He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?"
939987 [41341] 
939987 [41342] "Yes, here's the book."
939987 [41343] 
939987 [41344] "Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I'll hold you. Take the pen and
939987 [41345] scribble 'Raskolnikov' for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter
939987 [41346] to us than treacle."
939987 [41347] 
939987 [41348] "I don't want it," said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.
939987 [41349] 
939987 [41350] "Not want it?"
939987 [41351] 
939987 [41352] "I won't sign it."
939987 [41353] 
939987 [41354] "How the devil can you do without signing it?"
939987 [41355] 
939987 [41356] "I don't want... the money."
939987 [41357] 
939987 [41358] "Don't want the money! Come, brother, that's nonsense, I bear witness.
939987 [41359] Don't trouble, please, it's only that he is on his travels again. But
939987 [41360] that's pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of
939987 [41361] judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his
939987 [41362] hand and he will sign it. Here."
939987 [41363] 
939987 [41364] "But I can come another time."
939987 [41365] 
939987 [41366] "No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,
939987 [41367] Rodya, don't keep your visitor, you see he is waiting," and he made
939987 [41368] ready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest.
939987 [41369] 
939987 [41370] "Stop, I'll do it alone," said the latter, taking the pen and signing
939987 [41371] his name.
939987 [41372] 
939987 [41373] The messenger took out the money and went away.
939987 [41374] 
939987 [41375] "Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?"
939987 [41376] 
939987 [41377] "Yes," answered Raskolnikov.
939987 [41378] 
939987 [41379] "Is there any soup?"
939987 [41380] 
939987 [41381] "Some of yesterday's," answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.
939987 [41382] 
939987 [41383] "With potatoes and rice in it?"
939987 [41384] 
939987 [41385] "Yes."
939987 [41386] 
939987 [41387] "I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea."
939987 [41388] 
939987 [41389] "Very well."
939987 [41390] 
939987 [41391] Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,
939987 [41392] unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what
939987 [41393] would happen. "I believe I am not wandering. I believe it's reality," he
939987 [41394] thought.
939987 [41395] 
939987 [41396] In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced
939987 [41397] that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two
939987 [41398] spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The
939987 [41399] table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.
939987 [41400] 
939987 [41401] "It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us
939987 [41402] up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them."
939987 [41403] 
939987 [41404] "Well, you are a cool hand," muttered Nastasya, and she departed to
939987 [41405] carry out his orders.
939987 [41406] 
939987 [41407] Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile
939987 [41408] Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his
939987 [41409] left arm round Raskolnikov's head, although he was able to sit up, and
939987 [41410] with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that
939987 [41411] it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov
939987 [41412] swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after
939987 [41413] giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and
939987 [41414] said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.
939987 [41415] 
939987 [41416] Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
939987 [41417] 
939987 [41418] "And will you have tea?"
939987 [41419] 
939987 [41420] "Yes."
939987 [41421] 
939987 [41422] "Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on
939987 [41423] without the faculty. But here is the beer!" He moved back to his chair,
939987 [41424] pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he
939987 [41425] had not touched food for three days.
939987 [41426] 
939987 [41427] "I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now," he
939987 [41428] mumbled with his mouth full of beef, "and it's all Pashenka, your dear
939987 [41429] little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I
939987 [41430] don't ask for it, but, of course, I don't object. And here's Nastasya
939987 [41431] with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won't you have
939987 [41432] some beer?"
939987 [41433] 
939987 [41434] "Get along with your nonsense!"
939987 [41435] 
939987 [41436] "A cup of tea, then?"
939987 [41437] 
939987 [41438] "A cup of tea, maybe."
939987 [41439] 
939987 [41440] "Pour it out. Stay, I'll pour it out myself. Sit down."
939987 [41441] 
939987 [41442] He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As
939987 [41443] before, he put his left arm round the sick man's head, raised him up
939987 [41444] and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and
939987 [41445] earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective
939987 [41446] means towards his friend's recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made
939987 [41447] no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa
939987 [41448] without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but
939987 [41449] even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost
939987 [41450] animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying
939987 [41451] low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession
939987 [41452] of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
939987 [41453] Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen
939987 [41454] spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away
939987 [41455] capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real
939987 [41456] pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed
939987 [41457] that, too, and took note of it.
939987 [41458] 
939987 [41459] "Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some
939987 [41460] raspberry tea," said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking
939987 [41461] his soup and beer again.
939987 [41462] 
939987 [41463] "And where is she to get raspberries for you?" asked Nastasya, balancing
939987 [41464] a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of
939987 [41465] sugar.
939987 [41466] 
939987 [41467] "She'll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things
939987 [41468] have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in
939987 [41469] that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I
939987 [41470] resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.
939987 [41471] How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had
939987 [41472] forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know
939987 [41473] it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the
939987 [41474] Five Corners, Harlamov's house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov's
939987 [41475] house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov's, but
939987 [41476] Buch's. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I
939987 [41477] went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in
939987 [41478] two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there."
939987 [41479] 
939987 [41480] "My name!"
939987 [41481] 
939987 [41482] "I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while
939987 [41483] I was there. Well, it's a long story. But as soon as I did land on this
939987 [41484] place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know
939987 [41485] everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of
939987 [41486] Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.
939987 [41487] Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,
939987 [41488] and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows...."
939987 [41489] 
939987 [41490] "He's got round her," Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.
939987 [41491] 
939987 [41492] "Why don't you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?"
939987 [41493] 
939987 [41494] "You are a one!" Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. "I am
939987 [41495] not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna," she added suddenly, recovering from her
939987 [41496] mirth.
939987 [41497] 
939987 [41498] "I'll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,
939987 [41499] I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant
939987 [41500] influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not
939987 [41501] expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you
939987 [41502] think?"
939987 [41503] 
939987 [41504] Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,
939987 [41505] full of alarm.
939987 [41506] 
939987 [41507] "And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect," Razumihin went
939987 [41508] on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.
939987 [41509] 
939987 [41510] "Ah, the sly dog!" Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded
939987 [41511] her unspeakable delight.
939987 [41512] 
939987 [41513] "It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way
939987 [41514] at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so
939987 [41515] to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her
939987 [41516] character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that
939987 [41517] she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been
939987 [41518] mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,
939987 [41519] Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that's
939987 [41520] a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of
939987 [41521] foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as
939987 [41522] you would think at first sight?"
939987 [41523] 
939987 [41524] "No," mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better
939987 [41525] to keep up the conversation.
939987 [41526] 
939987 [41527] "She isn't, is she?" cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out
939987 [41528] of him. "But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,
939987 [41529] essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,
939987 [41530] I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and
939987 [41531] of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her
939987 [41532] intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a
939987 [41533] sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!
939987 [41534] I don't understand it! Well, that's all nonsense. Only, seeing that you
939987 [41535] are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and
939987 [41536] that through the young lady's death she has no need to treat you as
939987 [41537] a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and
939987 [41538] dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.
939987 [41539] And she's been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose
939987 [41540] the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay."
939987 [41541] 
939987 [41542] "It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost
939987 [41543] a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,"
939987 [41544] Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
939987 [41545] 
939987 [41546] "Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point
939987 [41547] Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have
939987 [41548] thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but
939987 [41549] the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the
939987 [41550] question, 'Is there any hope of realising the I O U?' Answer: there is,
939987 [41551] because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
939987 [41552] twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,
939987 [41553] too, who would go into bondage for his sake. That's what he was building
939987 [41554] upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs
939987 [41555] now, my dear boy--it's not for nothing that you were so open with
939987 [41556] Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as
939987 [41557] a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is
939987 [41558] open; and a business man 'listens and goes on eating' you up. Well,
939987 [41559] then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without
939987 [41560] hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this
939987 [41561] I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time
939987 [41562] harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping
939987 [41563] the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,
939987 [41564] brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten
939987 [41565] roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of
939987 [41566] presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I
939987 [41567] have torn it."
939987 [41568] 
939987 [41569] Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and
939987 [41570] turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a
939987 [41571] twinge.
939987 [41572] 
939987 [41573] "I see, brother," he said a moment later, "that I have been playing the
939987 [41574] fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe
939987 [41575] I have only made you cross."
939987 [41576] 
939987 [41577] "Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?" Raskolnikov
939987 [41578] asked, after a moment's pause without turning his head.
939987 [41579] 
939987 [41580] "Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought
939987 [41581] Zametov one day."
939987 [41582] 
939987 [41583] "Zametov? The head clerk? What for?" Raskolnikov turned round quickly
939987 [41584] and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.
939987 [41585] 
939987 [41586] "What's the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to
939987 [41587] make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How
939987 [41588] could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital
939987 [41589] fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are
939987 [41590] friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,
939987 [41591] you know. I have only just moved. I've been with him to Luise Ivanovna
939987 [41592] once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?
939987 [41593] 
939987 [41594] "Did I say anything in delirium?"
939987 [41595] 
939987 [41596] "I should think so! You were beside yourself."
939987 [41597] 
939987 [41598] "What did I rave about?"
939987 [41599] 
939987 [41600] "What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,
939987 [41601] brother, now I must not lose time. To work." He got up from the table
939987 [41602] and took up his cap.
939987 [41603] 
939987 [41604] "What did I rave about?"
939987 [41605] 
939987 [41606] "How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don't
939987 [41607] worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot
939987 [41608] about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky
939987 [41609] Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the
939987 [41610] assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest
939987 [41611] to you was your own sock. You whined, 'Give me my sock.' Zametov
939987 [41612] hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,
939987 [41613] ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you
939987 [41614] comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched
939987 [41615] thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely
939987 [41616] somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so
939987 [41617] piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort
939987 [41618] of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are
939987 [41619] thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account
939987 [41620] of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,
939987 [41621] though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And
939987 [41622] you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he
939987 [41623] wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted
939987 [41624] myself. Good-bye!"
939987 [41625] 
939987 [41626] "He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he's a deep one!" said Nastasya as he went
939987 [41627] out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist
939987 [41628] running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would
939987 [41629] say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
939987 [41630] 
939987 [41631] No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the
939987 [41632] bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching
939987 [41633] impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to
939987 [41634] work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.
939987 [41635] 
939987 [41636] "Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What
939987 [41637] if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,
939987 [41638] and then they will come in and tell me that it's been discovered long
939987 [41639] ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That's what I've
939987 [41640] forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered
939987 [41641] a minute ago."
939987 [41642] 
939987 [41643] He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment
939987 [41644] about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not
939987 [41645] what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to
939987 [41646] the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,
939987 [41647] put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the
939987 [41648] stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of
939987 [41649] his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as
939987 [41650] he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock
939987 [41651] about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on
939987 [41652] the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that
939987 [41653] Zametov could not have seen anything on it.
939987 [41654] 
939987 [41655] "Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police
939987 [41656] office? Where's the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I
939987 [41657] looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But
939987 [41658] what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?" he muttered,
939987 [41659] helplessly sitting on the sofa again. "What does it mean? Am I still in
939987 [41660] delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must
939987 [41661] escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but
939987 [41662] where? And where are my clothes? I've no boots. They've taken them away!
939987 [41663] They've hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that
939987 [41664] over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here's the I O U...
939987 [41665] I'll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won't find
939987 [41666] me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They'll find me, Razumihin will find
939987 [41667] me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them
939987 [41668] do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What
939987 [41669] else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don't know that I can walk,
939987 [41670] ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If
939987 [41671] only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch
939987 [41672] there--policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a
939987 [41673] bottle, cold!"
939987 [41674] 
939987 [41675] He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and
939987 [41676] gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.
939987 [41677] But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and
939987 [41678] even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the
939987 [41679] quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more
939987 [41680] disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With
939987 [41681] a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more
939987 [41682] closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,
939987 [41683] ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing
939987 [41684] sleep.
939987 [41685] 
939987 [41686] He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw
939987 [41687] Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or
939987 [41688] not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though
939987 [41689] trying to recall something.
939987 [41690] 
939987 [41691] "Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!"
939987 [41692] Razumihin shouted down the stairs. "You shall have the account
939987 [41693] directly."
939987 [41694] 
939987 [41695] "What time is it?" asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.
939987 [41696] 
939987 [41697] "Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it's almost evening, it will be six
939987 [41698] o'clock directly. You have slept more than six hours."
939987 [41699] 
939987 [41700] "Good heavens! Have I?"
939987 [41701] 
939987 [41702] "And why not? It will do you good. What's the hurry? A tryst, is it?
939987 [41703] We've all time before us. I've been waiting for the last three hours for
939987 [41704] you; I've been up twice and found you asleep. I've called on Zossimov
939987 [41705] twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And
939987 [41706] I've been out on my own business, too. You know I've been moving to-day,
939987 [41707] moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that's
939987 [41708] no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it
939987 [41709] directly. And how do you feel now, brother?"
939987 [41710] 
939987 [41711] "I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?"
939987 [41712] 
939987 [41713] "I tell you I've been waiting for the last three hours."
939987 [41714] 
939987 [41715] "No, before."
939987 [41716] 
939987 [41717] "How do you mean?"
939987 [41718] 
939987 [41719] "How long have you been coming here?"
939987 [41720] 
939987 [41721] "Why I told you all about it this morning. Don't you remember?"
939987 [41722] 
939987 [41723] Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could
939987 [41724] not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.
939987 [41725] 
939987 [41726] "Hm!" said the latter, "he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were
939987 [41727] not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really
939987 [41728] look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear
939987 [41729] boy."
939987 [41730] 
939987 [41731] He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.
939987 [41732] 
939987 [41733] "Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we
939987 [41734] must make a man of you. Let's begin from the top. Do you see this
939987 [41735] cap?" he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and
939987 [41736] ordinary cap. "Let me try it on."
939987 [41737] 
939987 [41738] "Presently, afterwards," said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.
939987 [41739] 
939987 [41740] "Come, Rodya, my boy, don't oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and
939987 [41741] I shan't sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.
939987 [41742] Just right!" he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, "just your size! A
939987 [41743] proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in
939987 [41744] its own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off
939987 [41745] his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other
939987 [41746] people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish
939987 [41747] politeness, but it's simply because he is ashamed of his bird's nest;
939987 [41748] he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of
939987 [41749] headgear: this Palmerston"--he took from the corner Raskolnikov's old,
939987 [41750] battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--"or
939987 [41751] this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,
939987 [41752] Nastasya!" he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not
939987 [41753] speak.
939987 [41754] 
939987 [41755] "Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say," answered Nastasya.
939987 [41756] 
939987 [41757] "Twenty copecks, silly!" he cried, offended. "Why, nowadays you would
939987 [41758] cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been
939987 [41759] worn. And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they will
939987 [41760] give you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to
939987 [41761] the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure
939987 [41762] you I am proud of these breeches," and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a
939987 [41763] pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. "No holes, no
939987 [41764] spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat
939987 [41765] to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an
939987 [41766] improvement, it's softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,
939987 [41767] the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the
939987 [41768] seasons; if you don't insist on having asparagus in January, you keep
939987 [41769] your money in your purse; and it's the same with this purchase. It's
939987 [41770] summer now, so I've been buying summer things--warmer materials will be
939987 [41771] wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...
939987 [41772] especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of
939987 [41773] coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What
939987 [41774] do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:
939987 [41775] if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only
939987 [41776] do business on that system at Fedyaev's; if you've bought a thing once,
939987 [41777] you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your
939987 [41778] own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are
939987 [41779] a bit worn, but they'll last a couple of months, for it's foreign work
939987 [41780] and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last
939987 [41781] week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.
939987 [41782] Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?"
939987 [41783] 
939987 [41784] "But perhaps they won't fit," observed Nastasya.
939987 [41785] 
939987 [41786] "Not fit? Just look!" and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov's
939987 [41787] old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. "I did not go
939987 [41788] empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.
939987 [41789] And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin
939987 [41790] with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well
939987 [41791] now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the
939987 [41792] suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the
939987 [41793] boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles
939987 [41794] fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were
939987 [41795] bought in the lo--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
939987 [41796] Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,
939987 [41797] you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will
939987 [41798] serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one's
939987 [41799] clothes from Sharmer's! As for your socks and other things, I leave them
939987 [41800] to you; we've twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying
939987 [41801] for your lodging, don't you worry. I tell you she'll trust you for
939987 [41802] anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you
939987 [41803] will throw off your illness with your shirt."
939987 [41804] 
939987 [41805] "Let me be! I don't want to!" Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened
939987 [41806] with disgust to Razumihin's efforts to be playful about his purchases.
939987 [41807] 
939987 [41808] "Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing,"
939987 [41809] Razumihin insisted. "Nastasya, don't be bashful, but help me--that's
939987 [41810] it," and in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance he changed his linen. The
939987 [41811] latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.
939987 [41812] 
939987 [41813] "It will be long before I get rid of them," he thought. "What money was
939987 [41814] all that bought with?" he asked at last, gazing at the wall.
939987 [41815] 
939987 [41816] "Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your
939987 [41817] mother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?"
939987 [41818] 
939987 [41819] "I remember now," said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.
939987 [41820] Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
939987 [41821] 
939987 [41822] The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar
939987 [41823] to Raskolnikov came in.
939987 [41824] 
939987 [41825] 
939987 [41826] 
939987 [41827] CHAPTER IV
939987 [41828] 
939987 [41829] Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face
939987 [41830] and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on
939987 [41831] his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable
939987 [41832] loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,
939987 [41833] fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his
939987 [41834] watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,
939987 [41835] nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made
939987 [41836] efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every
939987 [41837] instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever
939987 [41838] at his work.
939987 [41839] 
939987 [41840] "I've been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he's come to himself,"
939987 [41841] cried Razumihin.
939987 [41842] 
939987 [41843] "I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?" said Zossimov to
939987 [41844] Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the
939987 [41845] sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.
939987 [41846] 
939987 [41847] "He is still depressed," Razumihin went on. "We've just changed his
939987 [41848] linen and he almost cried."
939987 [41849] 
939987 [41850] "That's very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish
939987 [41851] it.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?"
939987 [41852] 
939987 [41853] "I am well, I am perfectly well!" Raskolnikov declared positively
939987 [41854] and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with
939987 [41855] glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to
939987 [41856] the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.
939987 [41857] 
939987 [41858] "Very good.... Going on all right," he said lazily. "Has he eaten
939987 [41859] anything?"
939987 [41860] 
939987 [41861] They told him, and asked what he might have.
939987 [41862] 
939987 [41863] "He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of
939987 [41864] course, you must not give him; he'd better not have meat either, and...
939987 [41865] but no need to tell you that!" Razumihin and he looked at each
939987 [41866] other. "No more medicine or anything. I'll look at him again to-morrow.
939987 [41867] Perhaps, to-day even... but never mind..."
939987 [41868] 
939987 [41869] "To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk," said Razumihin. "We are
939987 [41870] going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal."
939987 [41871] 
939987 [41872] "I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don't know... a little,
939987 [41873] maybe... but we'll see."
939987 [41874] 
939987 [41875] "Ach, what a nuisance! I've got a house-warming party to-night; it's
939987 [41876] only a step from here. Couldn't he come? He could lie on the sofa. You
939987 [41877] are coming?" Razumihin said to Zossimov. "Don't forget, you promised."
939987 [41878] 
939987 [41879] "All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?"
939987 [41880] 
939987 [41881] "Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our
939987 [41882] friends."
939987 [41883] 
939987 [41884] "And who?"
939987 [41885] 
939987 [41886] "All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and
939987 [41887] he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some
939987 [41888] business of his. We meet once in five years."
939987 [41889] 
939987 [41890] "What is he?"
939987 [41891] 
939987 [41892] "He's been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a
939987 [41893] little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I
939987 [41894] am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation
939987 [41895] Department here... But you know him."
939987 [41896] 
939987 [41897] "Is he a relation of yours, too?"
939987 [41898] 
939987 [41899] "A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled
939987 [41900] once, won't you come then?"
939987 [41901] 
939987 [41902] "I don't care a damn for him."
939987 [41903] 
939987 [41904] "So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a
939987 [41905] government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov."
939987 [41906] 
939987 [41907] "Do tell me, please, what you or he"--Zossimov nodded at
939987 [41908] Raskolnikov--"can have in common with this Zametov?"
939987 [41909] 
939987 [41910] "Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,
939987 [41911] as it were by springs; you won't venture to turn round on your own
939987 [41912] account. If a man is a nice fellow, that's the only principle I go upon.
939987 [41913] Zametov is a delightful person."
939987 [41914] 
939987 [41915] "Though he does take bribes."
939987 [41916] 
939987 [41917] "Well, he does! and what of it? I don't care if he does take bribes,"
939987 [41918] Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. "I don't praise him for
939987 [41919] taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one
939987 [41920] looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure
939987 [41921] I shouldn't be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown
939987 [41922] in."
939987 [41923] 
939987 [41924] "That's too little; I'd give two for you."
939987 [41925] 
939987 [41926] "And I wouldn't give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!
939987 [41927] Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him
939987 [41928] not repel him. You'll never improve a man by repelling him, especially
939987 [41929] a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive
939987 [41930] dullards! You don't understand. You harm yourselves running another man
939987 [41931] down.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common."
939987 [41932] 
939987 [41933] "I should like to know what."
939987 [41934] 
939987 [41935] "Why, it's all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of
939987 [41936] a mess! Though indeed there's nothing to fear now. The matter is
939987 [41937] absolutely self-evident. We only put on steam."
939987 [41938] 
939987 [41939] "A painter?"
939987 [41940] 
939987 [41941] "Why, haven't I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then
939987 [41942] about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed
939987 [41943] up in it..."
939987 [41944] 
939987 [41945] "Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...
939987 [41946] partly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too...."
939987 [41947] 
939987 [41948] "Lizaveta was murdered, too," Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing
939987 [41949] Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door
939987 [41950] listening.
939987 [41951] 
939987 [41952] "Lizaveta," murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
939987 [41953] 
939987 [41954] "Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn't you know her? She used to come
939987 [41955] here. She mended a shirt for you, too."
939987 [41956] 
939987 [41957] Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he
939987 [41958] picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began
939987 [41959] examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the
939987 [41960] petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless
939987 [41961] as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared
939987 [41962] obstinately at the flower.
939987 [41963] 
939987 [41964] "But what about the painter?" Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatter
939987 [41965] with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.
939987 [41966] 
939987 [41967] "Why, he was accused of the murder," Razumihin went on hotly.
939987 [41968] 
939987 [41969] "Was there evidence against him then?"
939987 [41970] 
939987 [41971] "Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what we
939987 [41972] have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and
939987 [41973] Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it's all done, it makes one
939987 [41974] sick, though it's not one's business! Pestryakov may be coming
939987 [41975] to-night.... By the way, Rodya, you've heard about the business already;
939987 [41976] it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the
939987 [41977] police office while they were talking about it."
939987 [41978] 
939987 [41979] Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.
939987 [41980] 
939987 [41981] "But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!"
939987 [41982] Zossimov observed.
939987 [41983] 
939987 [41984] "Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway," shouted Razumihin,
939987 [41985] bringing his fist down on the table. "What's the most offensive is not
939987 [41986] their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,
939987 [41987] for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship
939987 [41988] their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at
939987 [41989] first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter
939987 [41990] it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the
939987 [41991] murderers--that was their logic!"
939987 [41992] 
939987 [41993] "But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not
939987 [41994] help that.... And, by the way, I've met that man Koch. He used to buy
939987 [41995] unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?"
939987 [41996] 
939987 [41997] "Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession
939987 [41998] of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It's their
939987 [41999] sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means
939987 [42000] of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data
939987 [42001] alone how to get on the track of the real man. 'We have facts,' they
939987 [42002] say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in
939987 [42003] how you interpret them!"
939987 [42004] 
939987 [42005] "Can you interpret them, then?"
939987 [42006] 
939987 [42007] "Anyway, one can't hold one's tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible
939987 [42008] feeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the
939987 [42009] details of the case?"
939987 [42010] 
939987 [42011] "I am waiting to hear about the painter."
939987 [42012] 
939987 [42013] "Oh, yes! Well, here's the story. Early on the third day after the
939987 [42014] murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they
939987 [42015] accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an
939987 [42016] unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a
939987 [42017] dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller's
939987 [42018] case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. 'The
939987 [42019] day before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'--mark the day and the
939987 [42020] hour!--'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me
939987 [42021] already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and
939987 [42022] asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got
939987 [42023] them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him
939987 [42024] anything more.' I am telling you Dushkin's story. 'I gave him a note'--a
939987 [42025] rouble that is--'for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
939987 [42026] with another. It would all come to the same thing--he'd spend it on
939987 [42027] drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it
939987 [42028] the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any
939987 [42029] rumours, I'll take it to the police.' Of course, that's all taradiddle;
939987 [42030] he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and
939987 [42031] a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a
939987 [42032] thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply
939987 [42033] afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story. 'I've known
939987 [42034] this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same
939987 [42035] province and district of ZaraÃ¯sk, we are both Ryazan men. And though
939987 [42036] Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that
939987 [42037] house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.
939987 [42038] As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,
939987 [42039] took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.
939987 [42040] And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and
939987 [42041] her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt
939987 [42042] suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman
939987 [42043] lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful
939987 [42044] inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, "Is
939987 [42045] Nikolay here?" Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he
939987 [42046] had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,
939987 [42047] and went out again. Dmitri didn't see him again and is finishing the
939987 [42048] job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on
939987 [42049] the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to
939987 [42050] anyone'--that's Dushkin's tale--'but I found out what I could about
939987 [42051] the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight
939987 [42052] o'clock this morning'--that was the third day, you understand--'I saw
939987 [42053] Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could
939987 [42054] understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not
939987 [42055] speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep
939987 [42056] on a bench and our two boys. "Have you seen Dmitri?" said I. "No, I
939987 [42057] haven't," said he. "And you've not been here either?" "Not since the day
939987 [42058] before yesterday," said he. "And where did you sleep last night?"
939987 [42059] "In Peski, with the Kolomensky men." "And where did you get those
939987 [42060] ear-rings?" I asked. "I found them in the street," and the way he said
939987 [42061] it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. "Did you hear what happened
939987 [42062] that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?" said I.
939987 [42063] "No," said he, "I had not heard," and all the while he was listening,
939987 [42064] his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I
939987 [42065] told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted
939987 [42066] to keep him. "Wait a bit, Nikolay," said I, "won't you have a drink?"
939987 [42067] And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the
939987 [42068] bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
939987 [42069] I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his
939987 [42070] doing, as clear as could be....'"
939987 [42071] 
939987 [42072] "I should think so," said Zossimov.
939987 [42073] 
939987 [42074] "Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;
939987 [42075] they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;
939987 [42076] the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before
939987 [42077] yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He
939987 [42078] had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram
939987 [42079] for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went
939987 [42080] to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable
939987 [42081] adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a
939987 [42082] block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman
939987 [42083] screeched her hardest; people ran in. 'So that's what you are up to!'
939987 [42084] 'Take me,' he says, 'to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confess
939987 [42085] everything.' Well, they took him to that police station--that is
939987 [42086] here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old
939987 [42087] he is, 'twenty-two,' and so on. At the question, 'When you were working
939987 [42088] with Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a
939987 [42089] time?'--answer: 'To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did
939987 [42090] not notice them.' 'And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on?'
939987 [42091] 'We heard nothing special.' 'And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same
939987 [42092] day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?' 'I
939987 [42093] never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy
939987 [42094] Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.' 'And where did you find the
939987 [42095] ear-rings?' 'I found them on the pavement.' 'Why didn't you go to work
939987 [42096] with Dmitri the other day?' 'Because I was drinking.' 'And where were
939987 [42097] you drinking?' 'Oh, in such-and-such a place.' 'Why did you run away
939987 [42098] from Dushkin's?' 'Because I was awfully frightened.' 'What were
939987 [42099] you frightened of?' 'That I should be accused.' 'How could you be
939987 [42100] frightened, if you felt free from guilt?' Now, Zossimov, you may not
939987 [42101] believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it
939987 [42102] for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?"
939987 [42103] 
939987 [42104] "Well, anyway, there's the evidence."
939987 [42105] 
939987 [42106] "I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,
939987 [42107] of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed
939987 [42108] him and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat
939987 [42109] where I was painting with Dmitri.' 'And how was that?' 'Why, Dmitri and
939987 [42110] I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and
939987 [42111] Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.
939987 [42112] I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I
939987 [42113] ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen
939987 [42114] were there I don't remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other
939987 [42115] porter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too;
939987 [42116] and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,
939987 [42117] too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri's
939987 [42118] hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught
939987 [42119] me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper
939987 [42120] but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into
939987 [42121] the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back
939987 [42122] to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them
939987 [42123] together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the
939987 [42124] corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped
939987 [42125] up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,
939987 [42126] and in the box were the ear-rings....'"
939987 [42127] 
939987 [42128] "Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?" Raskolnikov
939987 [42129] cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he
939987 [42130] slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.
939987 [42131] 
939987 [42132] "Yes... why? What's the matter? What's wrong?" Razumihin, too, got up
939987 [42133] from his seat.
939987 [42134] 
939987 [42135] "Nothing," Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were
939987 [42136] silent for a while.
939987 [42137] 
939987 [42138] "He must have waked from a dream," Razumihin said at last, looking
939987 [42139] inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.
939987 [42140] 
939987 [42141] "Well, go on," said Zossimov. "What next?"
939987 [42142] 
939987 [42143] "What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and
939987 [42144] everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got
939987 [42145] a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and
939987 [42146] went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:
939987 [42147] 'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.'
939987 [42148] 'And why didn't you come to the police till now?' 'I was frightened.'
939987 [42149] 'And why did you try to hang yourself?' 'From anxiety.' 'What anxiety?'
939987 [42150] 'That I should be accused of it.' Well, that's the whole story. And now
939987 [42151] what do you suppose they deduced from that?"
939987 [42152] 
939987 [42153] "Why, there's no supposing. There's a clue, such as it is, a fact. You
939987 [42154] wouldn't have your painter set free?"
939987 [42155] 
939987 [42156] "Now they've simply taken him for the murderer. They haven't a shadow of
939987 [42157] doubt."
939987 [42158] 
939987 [42159] "That's nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You
939987 [42160] must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old
939987 [42161] woman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come there
939987 [42162] somehow. That's a good deal in such a case."
939987 [42163] 
939987 [42164] "How did they get there? How did they get there?" cried Razumihin.
939987 [42165] "How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more
939987 [42166] opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail
939987 [42167] to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don't you see at
939987 [42168] once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy
939987 [42169] truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped
939987 [42170] on the box and picked it up."
939987 [42171] 
939987 [42172] "The holy truth! But didn't he own himself that he told a lie at first?"
939987 [42173] 
939987 [42174] "Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov
939987 [42175] and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
939987 [42176] was sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got
939987 [42177] out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his
939987 [42178] arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on
939987 [42179] the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his
939987 [42180] hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the
939987 [42181] thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they 'like children'
939987 [42182] (the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,
939987 [42183] squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing
939987 [42184] one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful
939987 [42185] note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they
939987 [42186] found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open
939987 [42187] the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one
939987 [42188] question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish
939987 [42189] scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,
939987 [42190] robbery? They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for
939987 [42191] the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing
939987 [42192] that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they
939987 [42193] rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.
939987 [42194] And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!"
939987 [42195] 
939987 [42196] "Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed, but..."
939987 [42197] 
939987 [42198] "No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay's
939987 [42199] hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important
939987 [42200] piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation
939987 [42201] given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously
939987 [42202] against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him
939987 [42203] innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And
939987 [42204] do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will
939987 [42205] accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting
939987 [42206] simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively
939987 [42207] breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they
939987 [42208] won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-case
939987 [42209] and the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if he
939987 [42210] hadn't felt guilty.' That's the point, that's what excites me, you must
939987 [42211] understand!"
939987 [42212] 
939987 [42213] "Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof
939987 [42214] is there that the box came from the old woman?"
939987 [42215] 
939987 [42216] "That's been proved," said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.
939987 [42217] "Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who
939987 [42218] proved conclusively that it was his."
939987 [42219] 
939987 [42220] "That's bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time
939987 [42221] that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no
939987 [42222] evidence about that?"
939987 [42223] 
939987 [42224] "Nobody did see him," Razumihin answered with vexation. "That's the
939987 [42225] worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way
939987 [42226] upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.
939987 [42227] They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going
939987 [42228] on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether
939987 [42229] there actually were men at work in it."
939987 [42230] 
939987 [42231] "Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating
939987 [42232] one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...
939987 [42233] How do you explain the facts yourself?"
939987 [42234] 
939987 [42235] "How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At any
939987 [42236] rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and
939987 [42237] the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.
939987 [42238] The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked
939987 [42239] at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the
939987 [42240] murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of
939987 [42241] escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
939987 [42242] Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the
939987 [42243] porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of
939987 [42244] hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri
939987 [42245] and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;
939987 [42246] possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going
939987 [42247] in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when
939987 [42248] he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he
939987 [42249] had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that
939987 [42250] he did stand there.... That's how I explain it."
939987 [42251] 
939987 [42252] "Too clever! No, my boy, you're too clever. That beats everything."
939987 [42253] 
939987 [42254] "But, why, why?"
939987 [42255] 
939987 [42256] "Why, because everything fits too well... it's too melodramatic."
939987 [42257] 
939987 [42258] "A-ach!" Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened
939987 [42259] and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.
939987 [42260] 
939987 [42261] 
939987 [42262] 
939987 [42263] CHAPTER V
939987 [42264] 
939987 [42265] This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,
939987 [42266] and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the
939987 [42267] doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,
939987 [42268] as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.
939987 [42269] Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost
939987 [42270] affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow "cabin." With the
939987 [42271] same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,
939987 [42272] unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with
939987 [42273] the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and
939987 [42274] unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the
939987 [42275] face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a
939987 [42276] couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting
939987 [42277] took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,
939987 [42278] that he would get nothing in this "cabin" by attempting to overawe them,
939987 [42279] the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,
939987 [42280] emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:
939987 [42281] 
939987 [42282] "Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?"
939987 [42283] 
939987 [42284] Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not
939987 [42285] Razumihin anticipated him.
939987 [42286] 
939987 [42287] "Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?"
939987 [42288] 
939987 [42289] This familiar "what do you want" seemed to cut the ground from the
939987 [42290] feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked
939987 [42291] himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.
939987 [42292] 
939987 [42293] "This is Raskolnikov," mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he
939987 [42294] gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he
939987 [42295] lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold
939987 [42296] watch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly
939987 [42297] and lazily proceeded to put it back.
939987 [42298] 
939987 [42299] Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing
939987 [42300] persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that
939987 [42301] his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it
939987 [42302] was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just
939987 [42303] undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But
939987 [42304] the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,
939987 [42305] then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said "This is Raskolnikov"
939987 [42306] he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but
939987 [42307] weak and breaking, voice articulated:
939987 [42308] 
939987 [42309] "Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?"
939987 [42310] 
939987 [42311] The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:
939987 [42312] 
939987 [42313] "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name
939987 [42314] is not wholly unknown to you?"
939987 [42315] 
939987 [42316] But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed
939987 [42317] blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the
939987 [42318] name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.
939987 [42319] 
939987 [42320] "Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no
939987 [42321] information?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.
939987 [42322] 
939987 [42323] In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands
939987 [42324] behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into
939987 [42325] Luzhin's face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively
939987 [42326] than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
939987 [42327] 
939987 [42328] "I had presumed and calculated," he faltered, "that a letter posted more
939987 [42329] than ten days, if not a fortnight ago..."
939987 [42330] 
939987 [42331] "I say, why are you standing in the doorway?" Razumihin interrupted
939987 [42332] suddenly. "If you've something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so
939987 [42333] crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here's a chair, thread your way in!"
939987 [42334] 
939987 [42335] He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the
939987 [42336] table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the
939987 [42337] visitor to "thread his way in." The minute was so chosen that it was
939987 [42338] impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying
939987 [42339] and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at
939987 [42340] Razumihin.
939987 [42341] 
939987 [42342] "No need to be nervous," the latter blurted out. "Rodya has been ill for
939987 [42343] the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and
939987 [42344] has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.
939987 [42345] I am a comrade of Rodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I am
939987 [42346] nursing him; so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with your
939987 [42347] business."
939987 [42348] 
939987 [42349] "Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and
939987 [42350] conversation?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.
939987 [42351] 
939987 [42352] "N-no," mumbled Zossimov; "you may amuse him." He yawned again.
939987 [42353] 
939987 [42354] "He has been conscious a long time, since the morning," went on
939987 [42355] Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature
939987 [42356] that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,
939987 [42357] because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a
939987 [42358] student.
939987 [42359] 
939987 [42360] "Your mamma," began Luzhin.
939987 [42361] 
939987 [42362] "Hm!" Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him
939987 [42363] inquiringly.
939987 [42364] 
939987 [42365] "That's all right, go on."
939987 [42366] 
939987 [42367] Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.
939987 [42368] 
939987 [42369] "Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in
939987 [42370] her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to
939987 [42371] elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully
939987 [42372] assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my
939987 [42373] astonishment..."
939987 [42374] 
939987 [42375] "I know, I know!" Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.
939987 [42376] "So you are the _fiancÃ©_? I know, and that's enough!"
939987 [42377] 
939987 [42378] There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time,
939987 [42379] but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all
939987 [42380] meant. There was a moment's silence.
939987 [42381] 
939987 [42382] Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he
939987 [42383] answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as
939987 [42384] though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something
939987 [42385] new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at
939987 [42386] him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole
939987 [42387] appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of "fiancÃ©" so
939987 [42388] unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far
939987 [42389] too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few
939987 [42390] days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation
939987 [42391] of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,
939987 [42392] indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the
939987 [42393] agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such
939987 [42394] circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rÃ´le of
939987 [42395] fiancÃ©. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were all
939987 [42396] right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even
939987 [42397] the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [42398] treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The
939987 [42399] exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,
939987 [42400] if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in
939987 [42401] his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr
939987 [42402] Petrovitch's attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,
939987 [42403] light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a
939987 [42404] cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best
939987 [42405] of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even
939987 [42406] handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.
939987 [42407] His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,
939987 [42408] growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,
939987 [42409] touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled
939987 [42410] at a hairdresser's, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair
939987 [42411] usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.
939987 [42412] If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather
939987 [42413] good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other
939987 [42414] causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled
939987 [42415] malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as
939987 [42416] before.
939987 [42417] 
939987 [42418] But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no
939987 [42419] notice of their oddities.
939987 [42420] 
939987 [42421] "I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation," he began,
939987 [42422] again breaking the silence with an effort. "If I had been aware of your
939987 [42423] illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I
939987 [42424] have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention
939987 [42425] other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your
939987 [42426] mamma and sister any minute."
939987 [42427] 
939987 [42428] Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed
939987 [42429] some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing
939987 [42430] followed, he went on:
939987 [42431] 
939987 [42432] "... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival."
939987 [42433] 
939987 [42434] "Where?" asked Raskolnikov weakly.
939987 [42435] 
939987 [42436] "Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house."
939987 [42437] 
939987 [42438] "That's in Voskresensky," put in Razumihin. "There are two storeys of
939987 [42439] rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there."
939987 [42440] 
939987 [42441] "Yes, rooms..."
939987 [42442] 
939987 [42443] "A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtful
939987 [42444] character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer
939987 [42445] people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It's
939987 [42446] cheap, though..."
939987 [42447] 
939987 [42448] "I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger
939987 [42449] in Petersburg myself," Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. "However, the
939987 [42450] two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...
939987 [42451] I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat," he said,
939987 [42452] addressing Raskolnikov, "and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am
939987 [42453] myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch
939987 [42454] Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me
939987 [42455] of Bakaleyev's house, too..."
939987 [42456] 
939987 [42457] "Lebeziatnikov?" said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.
939987 [42458] 
939987 [42459] "Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you
939987 [42460] know him?"
939987 [42461] 
939987 [42462] "Yes... no," Raskolnikov answered.
939987 [42463] 
939987 [42464] "Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....
939987 [42465] A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one
939987 [42466] learns new things from them." Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.
939987 [42467] 
939987 [42468] "How do you mean?" asked Razumihin.
939987 [42469] 
939987 [42470] "In the most serious and essential matters," Pyotr Petrovitch replied,
939987 [42471] as though delighted at the question. "You see, it's ten years since I
939987 [42472] visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in
939987 [42473] the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.
939987 [42474] And it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the
939987 [42475] younger generation. And I confess I am delighted..."
939987 [42476] 
939987 [42477] "At what?"
939987 [42478] 
939987 [42479] "Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find
939987 [42480] clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality..."
939987 [42481] 
939987 [42482] "That's true," Zossimov let drop.
939987 [42483] 
939987 [42484] "Nonsense! There's no practicality." Razumihin flew at him.
939987 [42485] "Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from
939987 [42486] heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from
939987 [42487] all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting," he said to
939987 [42488] Pyotr Petrovitch, "and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish
939987 [42489] form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.
939987 [42490] Anyway, there's no practicality. Practicality goes well shod."
939987 [42491] 
939987 [42492] "I don't agree with you," Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident
939987 [42493] enjoyment. "Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,
939987 [42494] but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of
939987 [42495] enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little
939987 [42496] has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.
939987 [42497] It's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been
939987 [42498] accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are
939987 [42499] circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.
939987 [42500] Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been
939987 [42501] rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves
939987 [42502] off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great
939987 [42503] thing..."
939987 [42504] 
939987 [42505] "He's learnt it by heart to show off!" Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.
939987 [42506] 
939987 [42507] "What?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received
939987 [42508] no reply.
939987 [42509] 
939987 [42510] "That's all true," Zossimov hastened to interpose.
939987 [42511] 
939987 [42512] "Isn't it so?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.
939987 [42513] "You must admit," he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of
939987 [42514] triumph and superciliousness--he almost added "young man"--"that there
939987 [42515] is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and
939987 [42516] economic truth..."
939987 [42517] 
939987 [42518] "A commonplace."
939987 [42519] 
939987 [42520] "No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, 'love
939987 [42521] thy neighbour,' what came of it?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with
939987 [42522] excessive haste. "It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my
939987 [42523] neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has
939987 [42524] it, 'Catch several hares and you won't catch one.' Science now tells
939987 [42525] us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on
939987 [42526] self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly
939987 [42527] and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private
939987 [42528] affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the
939987 [42529] firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare
939987 [42530] organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for
939987 [42531] myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to
939987 [42532] pass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not
939987 [42533] from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general
939987 [42534] advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time
939987 [42535] reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it
939987 [42536] would seem to want very little wit to perceive it..."
939987 [42537] 
939987 [42538] "Excuse me, I've very little wit myself," Razumihin cut in sharply,
939987 [42539] "and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I've
939987 [42540] grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse
939987 [42541] oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,
939987 [42542] by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a
939987 [42543] hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you,
939987 [42544] that's quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you
939987 [42545] are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive
939987 [42546] cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything
939987 [42547] they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That's
939987 [42548] enough!"
939987 [42549] 
939987 [42550] "Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive
939987 [42551] dignity. "Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too..."
939987 [42552] 
939987 [42553] "Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that's enough," Razumihin
939987 [42554] concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous
939987 [42555] conversation.
939987 [42556] 
939987 [42557] Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up
939987 [42558] his mind to take leave in another minute or two.
939987 [42559] 
939987 [42560] "I trust our acquaintance," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "may, upon
939987 [42561] your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,
939987 [42562] become closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health..."
939987 [42563] 
939987 [42564] Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting
939987 [42565] up from his chair.
939987 [42566] 
939987 [42567] "One of her customers must have killed her," Zossimov declared
939987 [42568] positively.
939987 [42569] 
939987 [42570] "Not a doubt of it," replied Razumihin. "Porfiry doesn't give his
939987 [42571] opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there."
939987 [42572] 
939987 [42573] "Examining them?" Raskolnikov asked aloud.
939987 [42574] 
939987 [42575] "Yes. What then?"
939987 [42576] 
939987 [42577] "Nothing."
939987 [42578] 
939987 [42579] "How does he get hold of them?" asked Zossimov.
939987 [42580] 
939987 [42581] "Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the
939987 [42582] wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves."
939987 [42583] 
939987 [42584] "It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!
939987 [42585] The coolness!"
939987 [42586] 
939987 [42587] "That's just what it wasn't!" interposed Razumihin. "That's what throws
939987 [42588] you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not
939987 [42589] practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that
939987 [42590] it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work. Suppose
939987 [42591] him to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance
939987 [42592] that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee
939987 [42593] obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth
939987 [42594] ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the
939987 [42595] old woman's trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,
939987 [42596] besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know
939987 [42597] how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,
939987 [42598] his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good
939987 [42599] counsel!"
939987 [42600] 
939987 [42601] "You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?" Pyotr
939987 [42602] Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves
939987 [42603] in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more
939987 [42604] intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable
939987 [42605] impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.
939987 [42606] 
939987 [42607] "Yes. You've heard of it?"
939987 [42608] 
939987 [42609] "Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood."
939987 [42610] 
939987 [42611] "Do you know the details?"
939987 [42612] 
939987 [42613] "I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in the
939987 [42614] case--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime
939987 [42615] has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last
939987 [42616] five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,
939987 [42617] what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,
939987 [42618] too, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a
939987 [42619] student's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of
939987 [42620] good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole
939987 [42621] gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of
939987 [42622] the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary
939987 [42623] abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old
939987 [42624] woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class
939987 [42625] in society--for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain
939987 [42626] this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?"
939987 [42627] 
939987 [42628] "There are many economic changes," put in Zossimov.
939987 [42629] 
939987 [42630] "How are we to explain it?" Razumihin caught him up. "It might be
939987 [42631] explained by our inveterate impracticality."
939987 [42632] 
939987 [42633] "How do you mean?"
939987 [42634] 
939987 [42635] "What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he
939987 [42636] was forging notes? 'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I
939987 [42637] want to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words,
939987 [42638] but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or
939987 [42639] working! We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking
939987 [42640] on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour
939987 [42641] struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours."
939987 [42642] 
939987 [42643]      [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.
939987 [42644]      --TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.
939987 [42645] 
939987 [42646] "But morality? And so to speak, principles..."
939987 [42647] 
939987 [42648] "But why do you worry about it?" Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. "It's
939987 [42649] in accordance with your theory!"
939987 [42650] 
939987 [42651] "In accordance with my theory?"
939987 [42652] 
939987 [42653] "Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and
939987 [42654] it follows that people may be killed..."
939987 [42655] 
939987 [42656] "Upon my word!" cried Luzhin.
939987 [42657] 
939987 [42658] "No, that's not so," put in Zossimov.
939987 [42659] 
939987 [42660] Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing
939987 [42661] painfully.
939987 [42662] 
939987 [42663] "There's a measure in all things," Luzhin went on superciliously.
939987 [42664] "Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to
939987 [42665] suppose..."
939987 [42666] 
939987 [42667] "And is it true," Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a
939987 [42668] voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, "is it true that
939987 [42669] you told your _fiancÃ©e_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what
939987 [42670] pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better
939987 [42671] to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over
939987 [42672] her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?"
939987 [42673] 
939987 [42674] "Upon my word," Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with
939987 [42675] confusion, "to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to
939987 [42676] assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,
939987 [42677] has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect
939987 [42678] who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed
939987 [42679] to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat
939987 [42680] high-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles
939987 [42681] from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in
939987 [42682] so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed..."
939987 [42683] 
939987 [42684] "I tell you what," cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and
939987 [42685] fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, "I tell you what."
939987 [42686] 
939987 [42687] "What?" Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.
939987 [42688] Silence lasted for some seconds.
939987 [42689] 
939987 [42690] "Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my
939987 [42691] mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!"
939987 [42692] 
939987 [42693] "What's the matter with you?" cried Razumihin.
939987 [42694] 
939987 [42695] "So that's how it is?" Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. "Let me tell
939987 [42696] you, sir," he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself
939987 [42697] but breathing hard, "at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed
939987 [42698] to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive
939987 [42699] a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after
939987 [42700] this..."
939987 [42701] 
939987 [42702] "I am not ill," cried Raskolnikov.
939987 [42703] 
939987 [42704] "So much the worse..."
939987 [42705] 
939987 [42706] "Go to hell!"
939987 [42707] 
939987 [42708] But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing
939987 [42709] between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him
939987 [42710] pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who
939987 [42711] had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,
939987 [42712] he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid
939987 [42713] crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of
939987 [42714] his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.
939987 [42715] 
939987 [42716] "How could you--how could you!" Razumihin said, shaking his head in
939987 [42717] perplexity.
939987 [42718] 
939987 [42719] "Let me alone--let me alone all of you!" Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.
939987 [42720] "Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am
939987 [42721] not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,
939987 [42722] alone, alone!"
939987 [42723] 
939987 [42724] "Come along," said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.
939987 [42725] 
939987 [42726] "But we can't leave him like this!"
939987 [42727] 
939987 [42728] "Come along," Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin
939987 [42729] thought a minute and ran to overtake him.
939987 [42730] 
939987 [42731] "It might be worse not to obey him," said Zossimov on the stairs. "He
939987 [42732] mustn't be irritated."
939987 [42733] 
939987 [42734] "What's the matter with him?"
939987 [42735] 
939987 [42736] "If only he could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it! At
939987 [42737] first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some
939987 [42738] fixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!"
939987 [42739] 
939987 [42740] "Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation
939987 [42741] I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a
939987 [42742] letter about it just before his illness...."
939987 [42743] 
939987 [42744] "Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have
939987 [42745] you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to
939987 [42746] anything except one point on which he seems excited--that's the murder?"
939987 [42747] 
939987 [42748] "Yes, yes," Razumihin agreed, "I noticed that, too. He is interested,
939987 [42749] frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police
939987 [42750] office; he fainted."
939987 [42751] 
939987 [42752] "Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you something
939987 [42753] afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I'll go and see
939987 [42754] him again.... There'll be no inflammation though."
939987 [42755] 
939987 [42756] "Thanks! And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him
939987 [42757] through Nastasya...."
939987 [42758] 
939987 [42759] Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,
939987 [42760] but she still lingered.
939987 [42761] 
939987 [42762] "Won't you have some tea now?" she asked.
939987 [42763] 
939987 [42764] "Later! I am sleepy! Leave me."
939987 [42765] 
939987 [42766] He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.
939987 [42767] 
939987 [42768] 
939987 [42769] 
939987 [42770] CHAPTER VI
939987 [42771] 
939987 [42772] But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the
939987 [42773] parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again
939987 [42774] and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become
939987 [42775] perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic
939987 [42776] fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange
939987 [42777] sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was
939987 [42778] evident in them. "To-day, to-day," he muttered to himself. He understood
939987 [42779] that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him
939987 [42780] strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not
939987 [42781] fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he
939987 [42782] looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment's thought
939987 [42783] put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the
939987 [42784] copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.
939987 [42785] Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and
939987 [42786] glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back
939987 [42787] to him, blowing up the landlady's samovar. She heard nothing. Who would
939987 [42788] have dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the
939987 [42789] street.
939987 [42790] 
939987 [42791] It was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as
939987 [42792] before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head
939987 [42793] felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his
939987 [42794] feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and
939987 [42795] did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: "that all
939987 [42796] _this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would
939987 [42797] not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like
939987 [42798] that_." How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,
939987 [42799] he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought
939987 [42800] tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be
939987 [42801] changed "one way or another," he repeated with desperate and immovable
939987 [42802] self-confidence and determination.
939987 [42803] 
939987 [42804] From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay
939987 [42805] Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in
939987 [42806] the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very
939987 [42807] sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood
939987 [42808] on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a
939987 [42809] mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very
939987 [42810] old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and
939987 [42811] coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from
939987 [42812] the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five
939987 [42813] copeck piece and put it in the girl's hand. She broke off abruptly on a
939987 [42814] sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder "Come on,"
939987 [42815] and both moved on to the next shop.
939987 [42816] 
939987 [42817] "Do you like street music?" said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged
939987 [42818] man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.
939987 [42819] 
939987 [42820] "I love to hear singing to a street organ," said Raskolnikov, and his
939987 [42821] manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--"I like it
939987 [42822] on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the
939987 [42823] passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet
939987 [42824] snow is falling straight down, when there's no wind--you know what I
939987 [42825] mean?--and the street lamps shine through it..."
939987 [42826] 
939987 [42827] "I don't know.... Excuse me..." muttered the stranger, frightened by the
939987 [42828] question and Raskolnikov's strange manner, and he crossed over to the
939987 [42829] other side of the street.
939987 [42830] 
939987 [42831] Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay
939987 [42832] Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but
939987 [42833] they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round
939987 [42834] and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a
939987 [42835] corn chandler's shop.
939987 [42836] 
939987 [42837] "Isn't there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?"
939987 [42838] 
939987 [42839] "All sorts of people keep booths here," answered the young man, glancing
939987 [42840] superciliously at Raskolnikov.
939987 [42841] 
939987 [42842] "What's his name?"
939987 [42843] 
939987 [42844] "What he was christened."
939987 [42845] 
939987 [42846] "Aren't you a ZaraÃ¯sky man, too? Which province?"
939987 [42847] 
939987 [42848] The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.
939987 [42849] 
939987 [42850] "It's not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously
939987 [42851] forgive me, your excellency!"
939987 [42852] 
939987 [42853] "Is that a tavern at the top there?"
939987 [42854] 
939987 [42855] "Yes, it's an eating-house and there's a billiard-room and you'll find
939987 [42856] princesses there too.... La-la!"
939987 [42857] 
939987 [42858] Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd
939987 [42859] of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking
939987 [42860] at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into
939987 [42861] conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they
939987 [42862] were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and
939987 [42863] took a turning to the right in the direction of V.
939987 [42864] 
939987 [42865] He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading
939987 [42866] from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn
939987 [42867] to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might
939987 [42868] feel more so.
939987 [42869] 
939987 [42870] Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great
939987 [42871] block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;
939987 [42872] women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their
939987 [42873] indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,
939987 [42874] especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in
939987 [42875] the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the
939987 [42876] tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.
939987 [42877] A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the
939987 [42878] steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken
939987 [42879] soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,
939987 [42880] swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had
939987 [42881] forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead
939987 [42882] drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of
939987 [42883] women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore
939987 [42884] cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some
939987 [42885] not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.
939987 [42886] 
939987 [42887] He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and
939987 [42888] uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing
939987 [42889] frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar
939987 [42890] and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,
939987 [42891] gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping
939987 [42892] inquisitively in from the pavement.
939987 [42893] 
939987 [42894]   "Oh, my handsome soldier
939987 [42895]    Don't beat me for nothing,"
939987 [42896] 
939987 [42897] trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to
939987 [42898] make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.
939987 [42899] 
939987 [42900] "Shall I go in?" he thought. "They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get
939987 [42901] drunk?"
939987 [42902] 
939987 [42903] "Won't you come in?" one of the women asked him. Her voice was
939987 [42904] still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not
939987 [42905] repulsive--the only one of the group.
939987 [42906] 
939987 [42907] "Why, she's pretty," he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.
939987 [42908] 
939987 [42909] She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.
939987 [42910] 
939987 [42911] "You're very nice looking yourself," she said.
939987 [42912] 
939987 [42913] "Isn't he thin though!" observed another woman in a deep bass. "Have you
939987 [42914] just come out of a hospital?"
939987 [42915] 
939987 [42916] "They're all generals' daughters, it seems, but they have all snub
939987 [42917] noses," interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing
939987 [42918] a loose coat. "See how jolly they are."
939987 [42919] 
939987 [42920] "Go along with you!"
939987 [42921] 
939987 [42922] "I'll go, sweetie!"
939987 [42923] 
939987 [42924] And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.
939987 [42925] 
939987 [42926] "I say, sir," the girl shouted after him.
939987 [42927] 
939987 [42928] "What is it?"
939987 [42929] 
939987 [42930] She hesitated.
939987 [42931] 
939987 [42932] "I'll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but
939987 [42933] now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there's a nice young
939987 [42934] man!"
939987 [42935] 
939987 [42936] Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.
939987 [42937] 
939987 [42938] "Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!"
939987 [42939] 
939987 [42940] "What's your name?"
939987 [42941] 
939987 [42942] "Ask for Duclida."
939987 [42943] 
939987 [42944] "Well, that's too much," one of the women observed, shaking her head
939987 [42945] at Duclida. "I don't know how you can ask like that. I believe I should
939987 [42946] drop with shame...."
939987 [42947] 
939987 [42948] Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench
939987 [42949] of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made
939987 [42950] her criticism quietly and earnestly. "Where is it," thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [42951] "Where is it I've read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,
939987 [42952] an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,
939987 [42953] on such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean,
939987 [42954] everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around
939987 [42955] him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his
939987 [42956] life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die
939987 [42957] at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...
939987 [42958] How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile
939987 [42959] is he who calls him vile for that," he added a moment later.
939987 [42960] 
939987 [42961] He went into another street. "Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin
939987 [42962] was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it
939987 [42963] I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he'd read it in the
939987 [42964] papers. Have you the papers?" he asked, going into a very spacious and
939987 [42965] positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,
939987 [42966] however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a
939987 [42967] room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov
939987 [42968] fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that
939987 [42969] distance. "What if it is?" he thought.
939987 [42970] 
939987 [42971] "Will you have vodka?" asked the waiter.
939987 [42972] 
939987 [42973] "Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last
939987 [42974] five days, and I'll give you something."
939987 [42975] 
939987 [42976] "Yes, sir, here's to-day's. No vodka?"
939987 [42977] 
939987 [42978] The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and
939987 [42979] began to look through them.
939987 [42980] 
939987 [42981] "Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a
939987 [42982] staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire
939987 [42983] in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the
939987 [42984] Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....
939987 [42985] Ah, here it is!" He found at last what he was seeking and began to
939987 [42986] read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began
939987 [42987] eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands
939987 [42988] shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone
939987 [42989] sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk
939987 [42990] Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the
939987 [42991] watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the
939987 [42992] smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good
939987 [42993] humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark
939987 [42994] face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.
939987 [42995] 
939987 [42996] "What, you here?" he began in surprise, speaking as though he'd known
939987 [42997] him all his life. "Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were
939987 [42998] unconscious. How strange! And do you know I've been to see you?"
939987 [42999] 
939987 [43000] Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and
939987 [43001] turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of
939987 [43002] irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.
939987 [43003] 
939987 [43004] "I know you have," he answered. "I've heard it. You looked for my
939987 [43005] sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says
939987 [43006] you've been with him to Luise Ivanovna's--you know, the woman you tried
939987 [43007] to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he
939987 [43008] would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to
939987 [43009] understand--it was quite clear, wasn't it?"
939987 [43010] 
939987 [43011] "What a hot head he is!"
939987 [43012] 
939987 [43013] "The explosive one?"
939987 [43014] 
939987 [43015] "No, your friend Razumihin."
939987 [43016] 
939987 [43017] "You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most
939987 [43018] agreeable places. Who's been pouring champagne into you just now?"
939987 [43019] 
939987 [43020] "We've just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring
939987 [43021] it into me!"
939987 [43022] 
939987 [43023] "By way of a fee! You profit by everything!" Raskolnikov laughed, "it's
939987 [43024] all right, my dear boy," he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. "I
939987 [43025] am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that
939987 [43026] workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of
939987 [43027] the old woman...."
939987 [43028] 
939987 [43029] "How do you know about it?"
939987 [43030] 
939987 [43031] "Perhaps I know more about it than you do."
939987 [43032] 
939987 [43033] "How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You
939987 [43034] oughtn't to have come out."
939987 [43035] 
939987 [43036] "Oh, do I seem strange to you?"
939987 [43037] 
939987 [43038] "Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?"
939987 [43039] 
939987 [43040] "Yes."
939987 [43041] 
939987 [43042] "There's a lot about the fires."
939987 [43043] 
939987 [43044] "No, I am not reading about the fires." Here he looked mysteriously at
939987 [43045] Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. "No, I am not
939987 [43046] reading about the fires," he went on, winking at Zametov. "But confess
939987 [43047] now, my dear fellow, you're awfully anxious to know what I am reading
939987 [43048] about?"
939987 [43049] 
939987 [43050] "I am not in the least. Mayn't I ask a question? Why do you keep
939987 [43051] on...?"
939987 [43052] 
939987 [43053] "Listen, you are a man of culture and education?"
939987 [43054] 
939987 [43055] "I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium," said Zametov with some
939987 [43056] dignity.
939987 [43057] 
939987 [43058] "Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you
939987 [43059] are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!" Here Raskolnikov
939987 [43060] broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov's face. The latter drew
939987 [43061] back, more amazed than offended.
939987 [43062] 
939987 [43063] "Foo! how strange you are!" Zametov repeated very seriously. "I can't
939987 [43064] help thinking you are still delirious."
939987 [43065] 
939987 [43066] "I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You
939987 [43067] find me curious, do you?"
939987 [43068] 
939987 [43069] "Yes, curious."
939987 [43070] 
939987 [43071] "Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See
939987 [43072] what a lot of papers I've made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?"
939987 [43073] 
939987 [43074] "Well, what is it?"
939987 [43075] 
939987 [43076] "You prick up your ears?"
939987 [43077] 
939987 [43078] "How do you mean--'prick up my ears'?"
939987 [43079] 
939987 [43080] "I'll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,
939987 [43081] better 'I confess'... No, that's not right either; 'I make a deposition
939987 [43082] and you take it.' I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and
939987 [43083] searching...." he screwed up his eyes and paused. "I was searching--and
939987 [43084] came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old
939987 [43085] pawnbroker woman," he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing
939987 [43086] his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him
939987 [43087] steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov
939987 [43088] afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for
939987 [43089] exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.
939987 [43090] 
939987 [43091] "What if you have been reading about it?" he cried at last, perplexed
939987 [43092] and impatient. "That's no business of mine! What of it?"
939987 [43093] 
939987 [43094] "The same old woman," Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not
939987 [43095] heeding Zametov's explanation, "about whom you were talking in the
939987 [43096] police-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand
939987 [43097] now?"
939987 [43098] 
939987 [43099] "What do you mean? Understand... what?" Zametov brought out, almost
939987 [43100] alarmed.
939987 [43101] 
939987 [43102] Raskolnikov's set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he
939987 [43103] suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though
939987 [43104] utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with
939987 [43105] extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that
939987 [43106] moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch
939987 [43107] trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden
939987 [43108] desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at
939987 [43109] them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
939987 [43110] 
939987 [43111] "You are either mad, or..." began Zametov, and he broke off, as though
939987 [43112] stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.
939987 [43113] 
939987 [43114] "Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!"
939987 [43115] 
939987 [43116] "Nothing," said Zametov, getting angry, "it's all nonsense!"
939987 [43117] 
939987 [43118] Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became
939987 [43119] suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and
939987 [43120] leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten
939987 [43121] Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.
939987 [43122] 
939987 [43123] "Why don't you drink your tea? It's getting cold," said Zametov.
939987 [43124] 
939987 [43125] "What! Tea? Oh, yes...." Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of
939987 [43126] bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember
939987 [43127] everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face
939987 [43128] resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.
939987 [43129] 
939987 [43130] "There have been a great many of these crimes lately," said Zametov.
939987 [43131] "Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of
939987 [43132] false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They
939987 [43133] used to forge tickets!"
939987 [43134] 
939987 [43135] "Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,"
939987 [43136] Raskolnikov answered calmly. "So you consider them criminals?" he added,
939987 [43137] smiling.
939987 [43138] 
939987 [43139] "Of course they are criminals."
939987 [43140] 
939987 [43141] "They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred
939987 [43142] people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too
939987 [43143] many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in
939987 [43144] themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
939987 [43145] Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what
939987 [43146] a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these
939987 [43147] simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the
939987 [43148] rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his
939987 [43149] life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change
939987 [43150] the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand
939987 [43151] roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,
939987 [43152] but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the
939987 [43153] money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And
939987 [43154] the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?"
939987 [43155] 
939987 [43156] "That his hands trembled?" observed Zametov, "yes, that's quite
939987 [43157] possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can't
939987 [43158] stand things."
939987 [43159] 
939987 [43160] "Can't stand that?"
939987 [43161] 
939987 [43162] "Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn't. For the sake of a hundred
939987 [43163] roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes
939987 [43164] into a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I
939987 [43165] should not have the face to do it. Would you?"
939987 [43166] 
939987 [43167] Raskolnikov had an intense desire again "to put his tongue out." Shivers
939987 [43168] kept running down his spine.
939987 [43169] 
939987 [43170] "I should do it quite differently," Raskolnikov began. "This is how I
939987 [43171] would change the notes: I'd count the first thousand three or four times
939987 [43172] backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I'd set to the
939987 [43173] second thousand; I'd count that half-way through and then hold some
939987 [43174] fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light
939987 [43175] again--to see whether it was a good one. 'I am afraid,' I would say, 'a
939987 [43176] relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a
939987 [43177] false note,' and then I'd tell them the whole story. And after I began
939987 [43178] counting the third, 'No, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made a
939987 [43179] mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.'
939987 [43180] And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
939987 [43181] so on to the end. And when I had finished, I'd pick out one from the
939987 [43182] fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light
939987 [43183] and ask again, 'Change them, please,' and put the clerk into such a stew
939987 [43184] that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I'd finished and had
939987 [43185] gone out, I'd come back, 'No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.
939987 [43186] That's how I'd do it."
939987 [43187] 
939987 [43188] "Foo! what terrible things you say!" said Zametov, laughing. "But all
939987 [43189] that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you'd make a slip.
939987 [43190] I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on
939987 [43191] himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old
939987 [43192] woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a
939987 [43193] desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by
939987 [43194] a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the
939987 [43195] place, he couldn't stand it. That was clear from the..."
939987 [43196] 
939987 [43197] Raskolnikov seemed offended.
939987 [43198] 
939987 [43199] "Clear? Why don't you catch him then?" he cried, maliciously gibing at
939987 [43200] Zametov.
939987 [43201] 
939987 [43202] "Well, they will catch him."
939987 [43203] 
939987 [43204] "Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You've a tough job! A
939987 [43205] great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had
939987 [43206] no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any
939987 [43207] child can mislead you."
939987 [43208] 
939987 [43209] "The fact is they always do that, though," answered Zametov. "A man will
939987 [43210] commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes
939987 [43211] drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all
939987 [43212] as cunning as you are. You wouldn't go to a tavern, of course?"
939987 [43213] 
939987 [43214] Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.
939987 [43215] 
939987 [43216] "You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should
939987 [43217] behave in that case, too?" he asked with displeasure.
939987 [43218] 
939987 [43219] "I should like to," Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too
939987 [43220] much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.
939987 [43221] 
939987 [43222] "Very much?"
939987 [43223] 
939987 [43224] "Very much!"
939987 [43225] 
939987 [43226] "All right then. This is how I should behave," Raskolnikov began, again
939987 [43227] bringing his face close to Zametov's, again staring at him and speaking
939987 [43228] in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. "This is what
939987 [43229] I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should
939987 [43230] have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place
939987 [43231] with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden
939987 [43232] or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone
939987 [43233] weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from
939987 [43234] the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure
939987 [43235] to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that
939987 [43236] hole. Then I'd roll the stone back so that it would look as before,
939987 [43237] would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,
939987 [43238] three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There'd
939987 [43239] be no trace."
939987 [43240] 
939987 [43241] "You are a madman," said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a
939987 [43242] whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He
939987 [43243] had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.
939987 [43244] He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move
939987 [43245] without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he
939987 [43246] was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on
939987 [43247] his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break
939987 [43248] out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.
939987 [43249] 
939987 [43250] "And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?" he said
939987 [43251] suddenly and--realised what he had done.
939987 [43252] 
939987 [43253] Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His
939987 [43254] face wore a contorted smile.
939987 [43255] 
939987 [43256] "But is it possible?" he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked
939987 [43257] wrathfully at him.
939987 [43258] 
939987 [43259] "Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?"
939987 [43260] 
939987 [43261] "Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now," Zametov cried
939987 [43262] hastily.
939987 [43263] 
939987 [43264] "I've caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you
939987 [43265] believe less than ever?"
939987 [43266] 
939987 [43267] "Not at all," cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. "Have you been
939987 [43268] frightening me so as to lead up to this?"
939987 [43269] 
939987 [43270] "You don't believe it then? What were you talking about behind my
939987 [43271] back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive
939987 [43272] lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there," he shouted to the
939987 [43273] waiter, getting up and taking his cap, "how much?"
939987 [43274] 
939987 [43275] "Thirty copecks," the latter replied, running up.
939987 [43276] 
939987 [43277] "And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!" he
939987 [43278] held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. "Red notes and
939987 [43279] blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new
939987 [43280] clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You've cross-examined my
939987 [43281] landlady, I'll be bound.... Well, that's enough! _Assez causÃ©!_ Till we
939987 [43282] meet again!"
939987 [43283] 
939987 [43284] He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical
939987 [43285] sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he
939987 [43286] was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.
939987 [43287] His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation
939987 [43288] stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as
939987 [43289] quickly when the stimulus was removed.
939987 [43290] 
939987 [43291] Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in
939987 [43292] thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on
939987 [43293] a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.
939987 [43294] 
939987 [43295] "Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead," he decided.
939987 [43296] 
939987 [43297] Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he
939987 [43298] stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other
939987 [43299] till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood
939987 [43300] looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then
939987 [43301] anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.
939987 [43302] 
939987 [43303] "So here you are!" he shouted at the top of his voice--"you ran away
939987 [43304] from your bed! And here I've been looking for you under the sofa! We
939987 [43305] went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here
939987 [43306] he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole
939987 [43307] truth! Confess! Do you hear?"
939987 [43308] 
939987 [43309] "It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,"
939987 [43310] Raskolnikov answered calmly.
939987 [43311] 
939987 [43312] "Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a
939987 [43313] sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing
939987 [43314] in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!"
939987 [43315] 
939987 [43316] "Let me go!" said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much
939987 [43317] for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.
939987 [43318] 
939987 [43319] "Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I'll do
939987 [43320] with you directly? I'll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you
939987 [43321] home under my arm and lock you up!"
939987 [43322] 
939987 [43323] "Listen, Razumihin," Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--"can't
939987 [43324] you see that I don't want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to
939987 [43325] shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in
939987 [43326] fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I
939987 [43327] was very glad to die. Didn't I tell you plainly enough to-day that
939987 [43328] you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to
939987 [43329] torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my
939987 [43330] recovery, because it's continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov
939987 [43331] went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for
939987 [43332] goodness' sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don't
939987 [43333] you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can
939987 [43334] I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be
939987 [43335] ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God's sake, let me be!
939987 [43336] Let me be, let me be!"
939987 [43337] 
939987 [43338] He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was
939987 [43339] about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had
939987 [43340] been with Luzhin.
939987 [43341] 
939987 [43342] Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.
939987 [43343] 
939987 [43344] "Well, go to hell then," he said gently and thoughtfully. "Stay," he
939987 [43345] roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. "Listen to me. Let me tell
939987 [43346] you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you've any
939987 [43347] little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are
939987 [43348] plagiarists even in that! There isn't a sign of independent life in
939987 [43349] you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you've lymph in your veins
939987 [43350] instead of blood. I don't believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances
939987 [43351] the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!" he
939987 [43352] cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making
939987 [43353] a movement--"hear me out! You know I'm having a house-warming this
939987 [43354] evening, I dare say they've arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I
939987 [43355] just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren't a fool, a common
939987 [43356] fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...
939987 [43357] you see, Rodya, I recognise you're a clever fellow, but you're a
939987 [43358] fool!--and if you weren't a fool you'd come round to me this evening
939987 [43359] instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone
939987 [43360] out, there's no help for it! I'd give you a snug easy chair, my landlady
939987 [43361] has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any
939987 [43362] way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?"
939987 [43363] 
939987 [43364] "No."
939987 [43365] 
939987 [43366] "R-rubbish!" Razumihin shouted, out of patience. "How do you know?
939987 [43367] You can't answer for yourself! You don't know anything about it....
939987 [43368] Thousands of times I've fought tooth and nail with people and run back
939987 [43369] to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So
939987 [43370] remember, Potchinkov's house on the third storey...."
939987 [43371] 
939987 [43372] "Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you'd let anybody beat you from sheer
939987 [43373] benevolence."
939987 [43374] 
939987 [43375] "Beat? Whom? Me? I'd twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov's
939987 [43376] house, 47, Babushkin's flat...."
939987 [43377] 
939987 [43378] "I shall not come, Razumihin." Raskolnikov turned and walked away.
939987 [43379] 
939987 [43380] "I bet you will," Razumihin shouted after him. "I refuse to know you if
939987 [43381] you don't! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?"
939987 [43382] 
939987 [43383] "Yes."
939987 [43384] 
939987 [43385] "Did you see him?"
939987 [43386] 
939987 [43387] "Yes."
939987 [43388] 
939987 [43389] "Talked to him?"
939987 [43390] 
939987 [43391] "Yes."
939987 [43392] 
939987 [43393] "What about? Confound you, don't tell me then. Potchinkov's house, 47,
939987 [43394] Babushkin's flat, remember!"
939987 [43395] 
939987 [43396] Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.
939987 [43397] Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he
939987 [43398] went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.
939987 [43399] 
939987 [43400] "Confound it," he went on almost aloud. "He talked sensibly but yet...
939987 [43401] I am a fool! As if madmen didn't talk sensibly! And this was just what
939987 [43402] Zossimov seemed afraid of." He struck his finger on his forehead. "What
939987 [43403] if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,
939987 [43404] what a blunder! I can't." And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but
939987 [43405] there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to
939987 [43406] the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.
939987 [43407] 
939987 [43408] Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and
939987 [43409] leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting
939987 [43410] with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this
939987 [43411] place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending
939987 [43412] over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the
939987 [43413] sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at
939987 [43414] one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in
939987 [43415] the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,
939987 [43416] and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed
939987 [43417] before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal
939987 [43418] banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,
939987 [43419] saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He
939987 [43420] became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked
939987 [43421] and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,
939987 [43422] wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but
939987 [43423] obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her
939987 [43424] right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then
939987 [43425] her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and
939987 [43426] swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning
939987 [43427] woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head
939987 [43428] and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.
939987 [43429] 
939987 [43430] "A woman drowning! A woman drowning!" shouted dozens of voices; people
939987 [43431] ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people
939987 [43432] crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.
939987 [43433] 
939987 [43434] "Mercy on it! it's our Afrosinya!" a woman cried tearfully close by.
939987 [43435] "Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!"
939987 [43436] 
939987 [43437] "A boat, a boat" was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a
939987 [43438] boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great
939987 [43439] coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:
939987 [43440] she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of
939987 [43441] her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a
939987 [43442] comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They
939987 [43443] laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered
939987 [43444] consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,
939987 [43445] stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.
939987 [43446] 
939987 [43447] "She's drunk herself out of her senses," the same woman's voice wailed
939987 [43448] at her side. "Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang
939987 [43449] herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little
939987 [43450] girl to look after her--and here she's in trouble again! A neighbour,
939987 [43451] gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,
939987 [43452] see yonder...."
939987 [43453] 
939987 [43454] The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone
939987 [43455] mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange
939987 [43456] sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. "No, that's
939987 [43457] loathsome... water... it's not good enough," he muttered to himself.
939987 [43458] "Nothing will come of it," he added, "no use to wait. What about the
939987 [43459] police office...? And why isn't Zametov at the police office? The police
939987 [43460] office is open till ten o'clock...." He turned his back to the railing
939987 [43461] and looked about him.
939987 [43462] 
939987 [43463] "Very well then!" he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and
939987 [43464] walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and
939987 [43465] empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there
939987 [43466] was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out "to make an
939987 [43467] end of it all." Complete apathy had succeeded to it.
939987 [43468] 
939987 [43469] "Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlessly
939987 [43470] along the canal bank. "Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to.... But
939987 [43471] is it a way out? What does it matter! There'll be the square yard of
939987 [43472] space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or
939987 [43473] not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie
939987 [43474] down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don't
939987 [43475] care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one's head."
939987 [43476] 
939987 [43477] To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the
939987 [43478] second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the
939987 [43479] first turning he stopped and, after a minute's thought, turned into a
939987 [43480] side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any
939987 [43481] object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking
939987 [43482] at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted
939987 [43483] his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
939987 [43484] He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.
939987 [43485] An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the
939987 [43486] house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the
939987 [43487] right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
939987 [43488] The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing
939987 [43489] and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework
939987 [43490] of the window had been taken out. "That wasn't so then," he thought.
939987 [43491] Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been
939987 [43492] working. "It's shut up and the door newly painted. So it's to let." Then
939987 [43493] the third storey and the fourth. "Here!" He was perplexed to find the
939987 [43494] door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;
939987 [43495] he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last
939987 [43496] stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were
939987 [43497] workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he
939987 [43498] would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the
939987 [43499] same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed
939987 [43500] strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There
939987 [43501] were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the
939987 [43502] other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with
939987 [43503] lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for
939987 [43504] some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper
939987 [43505] with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.
939987 [43506] The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were
939987 [43507] hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took
939987 [43508] no notice of Raskolnikov's coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov
939987 [43509] folded his arms and listened.
939987 [43510] 
939987 [43511] "She comes to me in the morning," said the elder to the younger, "very
939987 [43512] early, all dressed up. 'Why are you preening and prinking?' says I. 'I
939987 [43513] am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!' That's a way of
939987 [43514] going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!"
939987 [43515] 
939987 [43516] "And what is a fashion book?" the younger one asked. He obviously
939987 [43517] regarded the other as an authority.
939987 [43518] 
939987 [43519] "A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the
939987 [43520] tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how
939987 [43521] to dress, the male sex as well as the female. They're pictures. The
939987 [43522] gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies' fluffles,
939987 [43523] they're beyond anything you can fancy."
939987 [43524] 
939987 [43525] "There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg," the younger cried
939987 [43526] enthusiastically, "except father and mother, there's everything!"
939987 [43527] 
939987 [43528] "Except them, there's everything to be found, my boy," the elder
939987 [43529] declared sententiously.
939987 [43530] 
939987 [43531] Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,
939987 [43532] the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very
939987 [43533] tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the
939987 [43534] corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and
939987 [43535] went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.
939987 [43536] 
939987 [43537] "What do you want?" he asked suddenly.
939987 [43538] 
939987 [43539] Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the
939987 [43540] bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and
939987 [43541] a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly
939987 [43542] fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more
939987 [43543] vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more
939987 [43544] satisfaction.
939987 [43545] 
939987 [43546] "Well, what do you want? Who are you?" the workman shouted, going out to
939987 [43547] him. Raskolnikov went inside again.
939987 [43548] 
939987 [43549] "I want to take a flat," he said. "I am looking round."
939987 [43550] 
939987 [43551] "It's not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up
939987 [43552] with the porter."
939987 [43553] 
939987 [43554] "The floors have been washed, will they be painted?" Raskolnikov went
939987 [43555] on. "Is there no blood?"
939987 [43556] 
939987 [43557] "What blood?"
939987 [43558] 
939987 [43559] "Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a
939987 [43560] perfect pool there."
939987 [43561] 
939987 [43562] "But who are you?" the workman cried, uneasy.
939987 [43563] 
939987 [43564] "Who am I?"
939987 [43565] 
939987 [43566] "Yes."
939987 [43567] 
939987 [43568] "You want to know? Come to the police station, I'll tell you."
939987 [43569] 
939987 [43570] The workmen looked at him in amazement.
939987 [43571] 
939987 [43572] "It's time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock
939987 [43573] up," said the elder workman.
939987 [43574] 
939987 [43575] "Very well, come along," said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going
939987 [43576] out first, he went slowly downstairs. "Hey, porter," he cried in the
939987 [43577] gateway.
939987 [43578] 
939987 [43579] At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;
939987 [43580] the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.
939987 [43581] Raskolnikov went straight up to them.
939987 [43582] 
939987 [43583] "What do you want?" asked one of the porters.
939987 [43584] 
939987 [43585] "Have you been to the police office?"
939987 [43586] 
939987 [43587] "I've just been there. What do you want?"
939987 [43588] 
939987 [43589] "Is it open?"
939987 [43590] 
939987 [43591] "Of course."
939987 [43592] 
939987 [43593] "Is the assistant there?"
939987 [43594] 
939987 [43595] "He was there for a time. What do you want?"
939987 [43596] 
939987 [43597] Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.
939987 [43598] 
939987 [43599] "He's been to look at the flat," said the elder workman, coming forward.
939987 [43600] 
939987 [43601] "Which flat?"
939987 [43602] 
939987 [43603] "Where we are at work. 'Why have you washed away the blood?' says he.
939987 [43604] 'There has been a murder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it.'
939987 [43605] And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. 'Come to the police
939987 [43606] station,' says he. 'I'll tell you everything there.' He wouldn't leave
939987 [43607] us."
939987 [43608] 
939987 [43609] The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.
939987 [43610] 
939987 [43611] "Who are you?" he shouted as impressively as he could.
939987 [43612] 
939987 [43613] "I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in
939987 [43614] Shil's house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he
939987 [43615] knows me." Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not
939987 [43616] turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.
939987 [43617] 
939987 [43618] "Why have you been to the flat?"
939987 [43619] 
939987 [43620] "To look at it."
939987 [43621] 
939987 [43622] "What is there to look at?"
939987 [43623] 
939987 [43624] "Take him straight to the police station," the man in the long coat
939987 [43625] jerked in abruptly.
939987 [43626] 
939987 [43627] Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the
939987 [43628] same slow, lazy tones:
939987 [43629] 
939987 [43630] "Come along."
939987 [43631] 
939987 [43632] "Yes, take him," the man went on more confidently. "Why was he going
939987 [43633] into _that_, what's in his mind, eh?"
939987 [43634] 
939987 [43635] "He's not drunk, but God knows what's the matter with him," muttered the
939987 [43636] workman.
939987 [43637] 
939987 [43638] "But what do you want?" the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry
939987 [43639] in earnest--"Why are you hanging about?"
939987 [43640] 
939987 [43641] "You funk the police station then?" said Raskolnikov jeeringly.
939987 [43642] 
939987 [43643] "How funk it? Why are you hanging about?"
939987 [43644] 
939987 [43645] "He's a rogue!" shouted the peasant woman.
939987 [43646] 
939987 [43647] "Why waste time talking to him?" cried the other porter, a huge peasant
939987 [43648] in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. "Get along! He is a rogue
939987 [43649] and no mistake. Get along!"
939987 [43650] 
939987 [43651] And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He
939987 [43652] lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in
939987 [43653] silence and walked away.
939987 [43654] 
939987 [43655] "Strange man!" observed the workman.
939987 [43656] 
939987 [43657] "There are strange folks about nowadays," said the woman.
939987 [43658] 
939987 [43659] "You should have taken him to the police station all the same," said the
939987 [43660] man in the long coat.
939987 [43661] 
939987 [43662] "Better have nothing to do with him," decided the big porter. "A regular
939987 [43663] rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you
939987 [43664] won't get rid of him.... We know the sort!"
939987 [43665] 
939987 [43666] "Shall I go there or not?" thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle
939987 [43667] of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as
939987 [43668] though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all
939987 [43669] was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to
939987 [43670] him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards
939987 [43671] away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
939987 [43672] In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the
939987 [43673] middle of the street. "What is it?" Raskolnikov turned to the right
939987 [43674] and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled
939987 [43675] coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to
939987 [43676] the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.
939987 [43677] 
939987 [43678] 
939987 [43679] 
939987 [43680] CHAPTER VII
939987 [43681] 
939987 [43682] An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of
939987 [43683] spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got
939987 [43684] off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....
939987 [43685] A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One
939987 [43686] of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying
939987 [43687] close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the
939987 [43688] coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
939987 [43689] 
939987 [43690] "What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!"
939987 [43691] 
939987 [43692] Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last
939987 [43693] in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a
939987 [43694] man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with
939987 [43695] blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was
939987 [43696] flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and
939987 [43697] disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
939987 [43698] 
939987 [43699] "Merciful heaven!" wailed the coachman, "what more could I do? If I'd
939987 [43700] been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,
939987 [43701] not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody
939987 [43702] else. A drunken man can't walk straight, we all know.... I saw him
939987 [43703] crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again
939987 [43704] and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell
939987 [43705] straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very
939987 [43706] tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,
939987 [43707] he screamed... that made them worse. That's how it happened!"
939987 [43708] 
939987 [43709] "That's just how it was," a voice in the crowd confirmed.
939987 [43710] 
939987 [43711] "He shouted, that's true, he shouted three times," another voice
939987 [43712] declared.
939987 [43713] 
939987 [43714] "Three times it was, we all heard it," shouted a third.
939987 [43715] 
939987 [43716] But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was
939987 [43717] evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who
939987 [43718] was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little
939987 [43719] anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to
939987 [43720] take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew
939987 [43721] his name.
939987 [43722] 
939987 [43723] Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The
939987 [43724] lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face. He recognised
939987 [43725] him.
939987 [43726] 
939987 [43727] "I know him! I know him!" he shouted, pushing to the front. "It's a
939987 [43728] government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close
939987 [43729] by in Kozel's house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?" He
939987 [43730] pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in
939987 [43731] violent agitation.
939987 [43732] 
939987 [43733] The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
939987 [43734] Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it
939987 [43735] had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious
939987 [43736] Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
939987 [43737] 
939987 [43738] "Just here, three houses away," he said eagerly, "the house belongs to
939987 [43739] Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,
939987 [43740] he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one
939987 [43741] daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is
939987 [43742] sure to be a doctor in the house. I'll pay, I'll pay! At least he will
939987 [43743] be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he'll die
939987 [43744] before you get him to the hospital." He managed to slip something
939987 [43745] unseen into the policeman's hand. But the thing was straightforward
939987 [43746] and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the
939987 [43747] injured man; people volunteered to help.
939987 [43748] 
939987 [43749] Kozel's house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,
939987 [43750] carefully holding Marmeladov's head and showing the way.
939987 [43751] 
939987 [43752] "This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn
939987 [43753] round! I'll pay, I'll make it worth your while," he muttered.
939987 [43754] 
939987 [43755] Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free
939987 [43756] moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and
939987 [43757] back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself
939987 [43758] and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest
939987 [43759] girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not
939987 [43760] understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so
939987 [43761] always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost
939987 [43762] to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little
939987 [43763] brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was
939987 [43764] waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.
939987 [43765] He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,
939987 [43766] serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels
939987 [43767] together and toes turned out.
939987 [43768] 
939987 [43769] He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting
939987 [43770] perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good
939987 [43771] little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little
939987 [43772] girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,
939987 [43773] waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve
939987 [43774] them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the
939987 [43775] other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,
939987 [43776] consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner
939987 [43777] during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than
939987 [43778] ever.
939987 [43779] 
939987 [43780] "You wouldn't believe, you can't imagine, Polenka," she said, walking
939987 [43781] about the room, "what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa's house
939987 [43782] and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!
939987 [43783] Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that
939987 [43784] everyone who came to see him said, 'We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,
939987 [43785] as our governor!' When I... when..." she coughed violently, "oh, cursed
939987 [43786] life," she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her
939987 [43787] breast, "when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal's...
939987 [43788] Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father
939987 [43789] and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once 'Isn't that the pretty
939987 [43790] girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?' (You must mend
939987 [43791] that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or
939987 [43792] to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger," she
939987 [43793] articulated with effort.) "Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just
939987 [43794] come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to
939987 [43795] make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions
939987 [43796] and told him that my heart had long been another's. That other was your
939987 [43797] father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me
939987 [43798] the shirt, and the stockings! Lida," said she to the youngest one, "you
939987 [43799] must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out
939987 [43800] with it... I'll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond
939987 [43801] doesn't come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,
939987 [43802] he has torn it to rags! I'd do it all together, so as not to have to
939987 [43803] work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!
939987 [43804] What's this?" she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,
939987 [43805] who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. "What is it? What are
939987 [43806] they bringing? Mercy on us!"
939987 [43807] 
939987 [43808] "Where are we to put him?" asked the policeman, looking round when
939987 [43809] Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.
939987 [43810] 
939987 [43811] "On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,"
939987 [43812] Raskolnikov showed him.
939987 [43813] 
939987 [43814] "Run over in the road! Drunk!" someone shouted in the passage.
939987 [43815] 
939987 [43816] Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The
939987 [43817] children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and
939987 [43818] clutched at her, trembling all over.
939987 [43819] 
939987 [43820] Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [43821] 
939987 [43822] "For God's sake be calm, don't be frightened!" he said, speaking
939987 [43823] quickly, "he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don't
939987 [43824] be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I've been
939987 [43825] here already, you remember? He will come to; I'll pay!"
939987 [43826] 
939987 [43827] "He's done it this time!" Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she
939987 [43828] rushed to her husband.
939987 [43829] 
939987 [43830] Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who
939987 [43831] swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man's head a
939987 [43832] pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining
939987 [43833] him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips
939987 [43834] and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.
939987 [43835] 
939987 [43836] Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a
939987 [43837] doctor, it appeared, next door but one.
939987 [43838] 
939987 [43839] "I've sent for a doctor," he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, "don't be
939987 [43840] uneasy, I'll pay. Haven't you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,
939987 [43841] anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe
939987 [43842] me.... We shall see what the doctor says!"
939987 [43843] 
939987 [43844] Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the
939987 [43845] corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in
939987 [43846] readiness for washing her children's and husband's linen that night.
939987 [43847] This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a
939987 [43848] week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they
939987 [43849] were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could
939987 [43850] not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she
939987 [43851] preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when
939987 [43852] the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry
939987 [43853] by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request,
939987 [43854] but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already
939987 [43855] succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off
939987 [43856] Marmeladov's face.
939987 [43857] 
939987 [43858] Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands
939987 [43859] to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began
939987 [43860] to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man
939987 [43861] brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
939987 [43862] 
939987 [43863] "Polenka," cried Katerina Ivanovna, "run to Sonia, make haste. If you
939987 [43864] don't find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over
939987 [43865] and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!
939987 [43866] there, put on the shawl."
939987 [43867] 
939987 [43868] "Run your fastest!" cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after
939987 [43869] which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his
939987 [43870] heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.
939987 [43871] 
939987 [43872] Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn't have
939987 [43873] dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a
939987 [43874] time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost
939987 [43875] all Madame Lippevechsel's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms
939987 [43876] of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but
939987 [43877] afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a
939987 [43878] fury.
939987 [43879] 
939987 [43880] "You might let him die in peace, at least," she shouted at the crowd,
939987 [43881] "is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,
939987 [43882] cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his
939987 [43883] hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!"
939987 [43884] 
939987 [43885] Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They
939987 [43886] evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after
939987 [43887] another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling
939987 [43888] of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden
939987 [43889] accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which
939987 [43890] no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and
939987 [43891] compassion.
939987 [43892] 
939987 [43893] Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying
939987 [43894] that they'd no business to make a disturbance here.
939987 [43895] 
939987 [43896] "No business to die!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to
939987 [43897] the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to
939987 [43898] face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident
939987 [43899] and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and
939987 [43900] irresponsible German.
939987 [43901] 
939987 [43902] "Ah, my God!" she cried, clasping her hands, "your husband drunken
939987 [43903] horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!"
939987 [43904] 
939987 [43905] "Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,"
939987 [43906] Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with
939987 [43907] the landlady that she might "remember her place" and even now could not
939987 [43908] deny herself this satisfaction). "Amalia Ludwigovna..."
939987 [43909] 
939987 [43910] "I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may
939987 [43911] not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna."
939987 [43912] 
939987 [43913] "You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not
939987 [43914] one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who's laughing
939987 [43915] behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of 'they are at it
939987 [43916] again' was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you
939987 [43917] Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that
939987 [43918] name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;
939987 [43919] he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
939987 [43920] Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,
939987 [43921] himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew
939987 [43922] me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been
939987 [43923] a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many
939987 [43924] friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable
939987 [43925] pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to
939987 [43926] Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has
939987 [43927] wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a
939987 [43928] child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna..."
939987 [43929] 
939987 [43930] All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,
939987 [43931] but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna's eloquence. At that
939987 [43932] instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she
939987 [43933] ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or
939987 [43934] understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew
939987 [43935] deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth
939987 [43936] and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising
939987 [43937] Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked
939987 [43938] at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.
939987 [43939] 
939987 [43940] "My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding," she said
939987 [43941] in despair. "We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon
939987 [43942] Zaharovitch, if you can," she cried to him.
939987 [43943] 
939987 [43944] Marmeladov recognised her.
939987 [43945] 
939987 [43946] "A priest," he articulated huskily.
939987 [43947] 
939987 [43948] Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window
939987 [43949] frame and exclaimed in despair:
939987 [43950] 
939987 [43951] "Oh, cursed life!"
939987 [43952] 
939987 [43953] "A priest," the dying man said again after a moment's silence.
939987 [43954] 
939987 [43955] "They've gone for him," Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her
939987 [43956] shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she
939987 [43957] returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for
939987 [43958] long.
939987 [43959] 
939987 [43960] Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in
939987 [43961] the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her
939987 [43962] wondering childish eyes.
939987 [43963] 
939987 [43964] "A-ah," he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.
939987 [43965] 
939987 [43966] "What now?" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [43967] 
939987 [43968] "Barefoot, barefoot!" he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the
939987 [43969] child's bare feet.
939987 [43970] 
939987 [43971] "Be silent," Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, "you know why she is
939987 [43972] barefooted."
939987 [43973] 
939987 [43974] "Thank God, the doctor," exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.
939987 [43975] 
939987 [43976] The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about
939987 [43977] him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully
939987 [43978] felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the
939987 [43979] blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's chest. It was gashed,
939987 [43980] crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.
939987 [43981] On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking
939987 [43982] yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse's hoof. The doctor
939987 [43983] frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and
939987 [43984] turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.
939987 [43985] 
939987 [43986] "It's wonderful that he has recovered consciousness," the doctor
939987 [43987] whispered softly to Raskolnikov.
939987 [43988] 
939987 [43989] "What do you think of him?" he asked.
939987 [43990] 
939987 [43991] "He will die immediately."
939987 [43992] 
939987 [43993] "Is there really no hope?"
939987 [43994] 
939987 [43995] "Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,
939987 [43996] too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.
939987 [43997] He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes."
939987 [43998] 
939987 [43999] "Better bleed him then."
939987 [44000] 
939987 [44001] "If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless."
939987 [44002] 
939987 [44003] At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,
939987 [44004] and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing
939987 [44005] the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
939987 [44006] The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.
939987 [44007] Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his
939987 [44008] shoulders and remained.
939987 [44009] 
939987 [44010] All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably
939987 [44011] understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
939987 [44012] Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt
939987 [44013] down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of
939987 [44014] her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his
939987 [44015] little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with
939987 [44016] precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which
939987 [44017] seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her
939987 [44018] lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling
939987 [44019] straight the boy's shirt, and managed to cover the girl's bare shoulders
939987 [44020] with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her
939987 [44021] knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was
939987 [44022] opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from
939987 [44023] all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not
939987 [44024] venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.
939987 [44025] 
939987 [44026] At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She
939987 [44027] came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for
939987 [44028] her mother, went up to her and said, "She's coming, I met her in the
939987 [44029] street." Her mother made her kneel beside her.
939987 [44030] 
939987 [44031] Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,
939987 [44032] and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,
939987 [44033] death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of
939987 [44034] the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,
939987 [44035] unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the
939987 [44036] doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.
939987 [44037] She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with
939987 [44038] its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the
939987 [44039] whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought
939987 [44040] with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat
939987 [44041] with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat
939987 [44042] was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in
939987 [44043] terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather
939987 [44044] pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the
939987 [44045] priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some
939987 [44046] words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a
939987 [44047] step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.
939987 [44048] 
939987 [44049] The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.
939987 [44050] The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and
939987 [44051] consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.
939987 [44052] 
939987 [44053] "What am I to do with these?" she interrupted sharply and irritably,
939987 [44054] pointing to the little ones.
939987 [44055] 
939987 [44056] "God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour," the priest began.
939987 [44057] 
939987 [44058] "Ach! He is merciful, but not to us."
939987 [44059] 
939987 [44060] "That's a sin, a sin, madam," observed the priest, shaking his head.
939987 [44061] 
939987 [44062] "And isn't that a sin?" cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying
939987 [44063] man.
939987 [44064] 
939987 [44065] "Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to
939987 [44066] compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings."
939987 [44067] 
939987 [44068] "You don't understand!" cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.
939987 [44069] "And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself
939987 [44070] under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.
939987 [44071] He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he
939987 [44072] wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he's dying! One
939987 [44073] less to keep!"
939987 [44074] 
939987 [44075] "You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a sin, madam, such
939987 [44076] feelings are a great sin."
939987 [44077] 
939987 [44078] Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,
939987 [44079] wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,
939987 [44080] and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now
939987 [44081] she flew at him almost in a frenzy.
939987 [44082] 
939987 [44083] "Ah, father! That's words and only words! Forgive! If he'd not been run
939987 [44084] over, he'd have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and
939987 [44085] in rags and he'd have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been
939987 [44086] sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children's
939987 [44087] and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I
939987 [44088] should have been darning them. That's how I spend my nights!... What's
939987 [44089] the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!"
939987 [44090] 
939987 [44091] A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief
939987 [44092] to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her
939987 [44093] aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed
939987 [44094] his head and said nothing.
939987 [44095] 
939987 [44096] Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face
939987 [44097] of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying
939987 [44098] to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and
939987 [44099] articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he
939987 [44100] wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:
939987 [44101] 
939987 [44102] "Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!" And the sick man
939987 [44103] was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the
939987 [44104] doorway and he saw Sonia.
939987 [44105] 
939987 [44106] Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a
939987 [44107] corner.
939987 [44108] 
939987 [44109] "Who's that? Who's that?" he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,
939987 [44110] in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his
939987 [44111] daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.
939987 [44112] 
939987 [44113] "Lie down! Lie do-own!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [44114] 
939987 [44115] With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his
939987 [44116] elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as
939987 [44117] though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.
939987 [44118] Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and
939987 [44119] gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying
939987 [44120] father. His face showed intense suffering.
939987 [44121] 
939987 [44122] "Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!" he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand
939987 [44123] to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on
939987 [44124] the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he
939987 [44125] was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so
939987 [44126] without moving. He died in her arms.
939987 [44127] 
939987 [44128] "He's got what he wanted," Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband's
939987 [44129] dead body. "Well, what's to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can
939987 [44130] I give them to-morrow to eat?"
939987 [44131] 
939987 [44132] Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [44133] 
939987 [44134] "Katerina Ivanovna," he began, "last week your husband told me all his
939987 [44135] life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate
939987 [44136] reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you
939987 [44137] all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [44138] in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became
939987 [44139] friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my
939987 [44140] dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any
939987 [44141] assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will
939987 [44142] be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....
939987 [44143] Good-bye!"
939987 [44144] 
939987 [44145] And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd
939987 [44146] to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim
939987 [44147] Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions
939987 [44148] in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but
939987 [44149] Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.
939987 [44150] 
939987 [44151] "Ah, is that you?" he asked him.
939987 [44152] 
939987 [44153] "He's dead," answered Raskolnikov. "The doctor and the priest have been,
939987 [44154] all as it should have been. Don't worry the poor woman too much, she is
939987 [44155] in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a
939987 [44156] kind-hearted man, I know..." he added with a smile, looking straight in
939987 [44157] his face.
939987 [44158] 
939987 [44159] "But you are spattered with blood," observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing
939987 [44160] in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat.
939987 [44161] 
939987 [44162] "Yes... I'm covered with blood," Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;
939987 [44163] then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.
939987 [44164] 
939987 [44165] He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious
939987 [44166] of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and
939987 [44167] strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be
939987 [44168] compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been
939987 [44169] pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on
939987 [44170] his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting
939987 [44171] with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid
939987 [44172] footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was
939987 [44173] running after him, calling "Wait! wait!"
939987 [44174] 
939987 [44175] He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped
939987 [44176] short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov
939987 [44177] could distinguish the child's thin but pretty little face, looking at
939987 [44178] him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message
939987 [44179] which she was evidently glad to give.
939987 [44180] 
939987 [44181] "Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?" she said
939987 [44182] hurriedly in a breathless voice.
939987 [44183] 
939987 [44184] He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of
939987 [44185] rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said
939987 [44186] why.
939987 [44187] 
939987 [44188] "Who sent you?"
939987 [44189] 
939987 [44190] "Sister Sonia sent me," answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.
939987 [44191] 
939987 [44192] "I knew it was sister Sonia sent you."
939987 [44193] 
939987 [44194] "Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,
939987 [44195] too, and said 'Run fast, Polenka.'"
939987 [44196] 
939987 [44197] "Do you love sister Sonia?"
939987 [44198] 
939987 [44199] "I love her more than anyone," Polenka answered with a peculiar
939987 [44200] earnestness, and her smile became graver.
939987 [44201] 
939987 [44202] "And will you love me?"
939987 [44203] 
939987 [44204] By way of answer he saw the little girl's face approaching him, her full
939987 [44205] lips naÃ¯vely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks
939987 [44206] held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl
939987 [44207] wept softly, pressing her face against him.
939987 [44208] 
939987 [44209] "I am sorry for father," she said a moment later, raising her
939987 [44210] tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. "It's
939987 [44211] nothing but misfortunes now," she added suddenly with that peculiarly
939987 [44212] sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak
939987 [44213] like grown-up people.
939987 [44214] 
939987 [44215] "Did your father love you?"
939987 [44216] 
939987 [44217] "He loved Lida most," she went on very seriously without a smile,
939987 [44218] exactly like grown-up people, "he loved her because she is little and
939987 [44219] because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But
939987 [44220] he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too," she added with
939987 [44221] dignity. "And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she
939987 [44222] liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,
939987 [44223] for it's time my education began."
939987 [44224] 
939987 [44225] "And do you know your prayers?"
939987 [44226] 
939987 [44227] "Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself
939987 [44228] as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.
939987 [44229] First they repeat the 'Ave Maria' and then another prayer: 'Lord,
939987 [44230] forgive and bless sister Sonia,' and then another, 'Lord, forgive and
939987 [44231] bless our second father.' For our elder father is dead and this is
939987 [44232] another one, but we do pray for the other as well."
939987 [44233] 
939987 [44234] "Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. 'And Thy
939987 [44235] servant Rodion,' nothing more."
939987 [44236] 
939987 [44237] "I'll pray for you all the rest of my life," the little girl declared
939987 [44238] hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him
939987 [44239] warmly once more.
939987 [44240] 
939987 [44241] Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to
939987 [44242] come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past
939987 [44243] ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on
939987 [44244] the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.
939987 [44245] 
939987 [44246] "Enough," he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. "I've done with
939987 [44247] fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven't I lived
939987 [44248] just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of
939987 [44249] Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the
939987 [44250] reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now
939987 [44251] we will see! We will try our strength!" he added defiantly, as though
939987 [44252] challenging some power of darkness. "And I was ready to consent to live
939987 [44253] in a square of space!
939987 [44254] 
939987 [44255] "I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.
939987 [44256] I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov's house
939987 [44257] is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if
939987 [44258] it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some
939987 [44259] satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you
939987 [44260] can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that's
939987 [44261] what they don't know," he added proudly and self-confidently and
939987 [44262] he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and
939987 [44263] self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming
939987 [44264] a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this
939987 [44265] revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a
939987 [44266] straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, 'could live, that there was still
939987 [44267] life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.' Perhaps he
939987 [44268] was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of
939987 [44269] that.
939987 [44270] 
939987 [44271] "But I did ask her to remember 'Thy servant Rodion' in her prayers," the
939987 [44272] idea struck him. "Well, that was... in case of emergency," he added and
939987 [44273] laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.
939987 [44274] 
939987 [44275] He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at
939987 [44276] Potchinkov's and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way
939987 [44277] upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big
939987 [44278] gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could
939987 [44279] hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin's room was fairly large; the
939987 [44280] company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,
939987 [44281] where two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with two
939987 [44282] samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up
939987 [44283] from the landlady's kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran
939987 [44284] out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a
939987 [44285] great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite
939987 [44286] drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.
939987 [44287] 
939987 [44288] "Listen," Raskolnikov hastened to say, "I've only just come to tell you
939987 [44289] you've won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to
939987 [44290] him. I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And
939987 [44291] so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow."
939987 [44292] 
939987 [44293] "Do you know what? I'll see you home. If you say you're weak yourself,
939987 [44294] you must..."
939987 [44295] 
939987 [44296] "And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped
939987 [44297] out?"
939987 [44298] 
939987 [44299] "He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle's, I expect, or perhaps
939987 [44300] he has come without being invited... I'll leave uncle with them, he
939987 [44301] is an invaluable person, pity I can't introduce you to him now. But
939987 [44302] confound them all now! They won't notice me, and I need a little fresh
939987 [44303] air, for you've come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I
939987 [44304] should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...
939987 [44305] you simply can't imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn't you
939987 [44306] imagine? Don't we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that's the
939987 [44307] way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov."
939987 [44308] 
939987 [44309] Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special
939987 [44310] interest in him; soon his face brightened.
939987 [44311] 
939987 [44312] "You must go to bed at once," he pronounced, examining the patient as
939987 [44313] far as he could, "and take something for the night. Will you take it? I
939987 [44314] got it ready some time ago... a powder."
939987 [44315] 
939987 [44316] "Two, if you like," answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.
939987 [44317] 
939987 [44318] "It's a good thing you are taking him home," observed Zossimov to
939987 [44319] Razumihin--"we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he's not at all
939987 [44320] amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn..."
939987 [44321] 
939987 [44322] "Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?"
939987 [44323] Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. "I won't tell
939987 [44324] you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me
939987 [44325] to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and
939987 [44326] afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's got a notion in his head
939987 [44327] that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,
939987 [44328] you've three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,
939987 [44329] you needn't care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,
939987 [44330] that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental
939987 [44331] diseases, and what's brought him to this conclusion about you was your
939987 [44332] conversation to-day with Zametov."
939987 [44333] 
939987 [44334] "Zametov told you all about it?"
939987 [44335] 
939987 [44336] "Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does
939987 [44337] Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little
939987 [44338] drunk now.... But that's... no matter... the point is that this
939987 [44339] idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you
939987 [44340] understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea
939987 [44341] is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that
939987 [44342] bubble's burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave
939987 [44343] Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that's between ourselves,
939987 [44344] brother; please don't let out a hint that you know of it; I've noticed
939987 [44345] he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's. But to-day, to-day
939987 [44346] it's all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He
939987 [44347] took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed
939987 [44348] of it himself now; I know that..."
939987 [44349] 
939987 [44350] Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too
939987 [44351] freely.
939987 [44352] 
939987 [44353] "I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint," said
939987 [44354] Raskolnikov.
939987 [44355] 
939987 [44356] "No need to explain that! And it wasn't the paint only: the fever had
939987 [44357] been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed
939987 [44358] that boy is now, you wouldn't believe! 'I am not worth his little
939987 [44359] finger,' he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,
939987 [44360] brother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais
939987 [44361] de Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,
939987 [44362] you know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced
939987 [44363] him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you
939987 [44364] suddenly--put out your tongue at him: 'There now, what do you make of
939987 [44365] it?' It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by
939987 [44366] Jove, it's what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn't there! He was hoping to
939987 [44367] see you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance..."
939987 [44368] 
939987 [44369] "Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?"
939987 [44370] 
939987 [44371] "Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,
939987 [44372] you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it's
939987 [44373] clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and
939987 [44374] how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little
939987 [44375] drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I
939987 [44376] tell you, he's mad on mental diseases. But don't you mind him..."
939987 [44377] 
939987 [44378] For half a minute both were silent.
939987 [44379] 
939987 [44380] "Listen, Razumihin," began Raskolnikov, "I want to tell you plainly:
939987 [44381] I've just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my
939987 [44382] money... and besides I've just been kissed by someone who, if I had
939987 [44383] killed anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else
939987 [44384] there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I
939987 [44385] am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly..."
939987 [44386] 
939987 [44387] "What's the matter? What's the matter with you?" Razumihin asked
939987 [44388] anxiously.
939987 [44389] 
939987 [44390] "I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am so sad, so sad...
939987 [44391] like a woman. Look, what's that? Look, look!"
939987 [44392] 
939987 [44393] "What is it?"
939987 [44394] 
939987 [44395] "Don't you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack..."
939987 [44396] 
939987 [44397] They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level
939987 [44398] of the landlady's door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that
939987 [44399] there was a light in Raskolnikov's garret.
939987 [44400] 
939987 [44401] "Queer! Nastasya, perhaps," observed Razumihin.
939987 [44402] 
939987 [44403] "She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,
939987 [44404] but... I don't care! Good-bye!"
939987 [44405] 
939987 [44406] "What do you mean? I am coming with you, we'll come in together!"
939987 [44407] 
939987 [44408] "I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say
939987 [44409] good-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!"
939987 [44410] 
939987 [44411] "What's the matter with you, Rodya?"
939987 [44412] 
939987 [44413] "Nothing... come along... you shall be witness."
939987 [44414] 
939987 [44415] They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that
939987 [44416] perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. "Ah, I've upset him with my
939987 [44417] chatter!" he muttered to himself.
939987 [44418] 
939987 [44419] When they reached the door they heard voices in the room.
939987 [44420] 
939987 [44421] "What is it?" cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the
939987 [44422] door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.
939987 [44423] 
939987 [44424] His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an
939987 [44425] hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of
939987 [44426] them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would
939987 [44427] arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had
939987 [44428] spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was
939987 [44429] standing before them and had told them everything by now. They were
939987 [44430] beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his "running away"
939987 [44431] to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! "Good
939987 [44432] Heavens, what had become of him?" Both had been weeping, both had been
939987 [44433] in anguish for that hour and a half.
939987 [44434] 
939987 [44435] A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov's entrance. Both rushed to
939987 [44436] him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck
939987 [44437] him like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he
939987 [44438] could not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,
939987 [44439] laughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,
939987 [44440] fainting.
939987 [44441] 
939987 [44442] Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the
939987 [44443] doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and
939987 [44444] in a moment had him on the sofa.
939987 [44445] 
939987 [44446] "It's nothing, nothing!" he cried to the mother and sister--"it's only a
939987 [44447] faint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,
939987 [44448] that he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is
939987 [44449] all right again!"
939987 [44450] 
939987 [44451] And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made
939987 [44452] her bend down to see that "he is all right again." The mother and sister
939987 [44453] looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They
939987 [44454] had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya
939987 [44455] during his illness, by this "very competent young man," as Pulcheria
939987 [44456] Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with
939987 [44457] Dounia.
939987 [44458] 
939987 [44459] 
939987 [44460] 
939987 [44461] 
939987 [44462] PART III
939987 [44463] 
939987 [44464] 
939987 [44465] 
939987 [44466] CHAPTER I
939987 [44467] 
939987 [44468] Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly
939987 [44469] to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations
939987 [44470] he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand
939987 [44471] and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
939987 [44472] His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion
939987 [44473] agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost
939987 [44474] insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
939987 [44475] 
939987 [44476] Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother's.
939987 [44477] 
939987 [44478] "Go home... with him," he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,
939987 [44479] "good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you
939987 [44480] arrived?"
939987 [44481] 
939987 [44482] "This evening, Rodya," answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "the train was
939987 [44483] awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I
939987 [44484] will spend the night here, near you..."
939987 [44485] 
939987 [44486] "Don't torture me!" he said with a gesture of irritation.
939987 [44487] 
939987 [44488] "I will stay with him," cried Razumihin, "I won't leave him for a
939987 [44489] moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts' content!
939987 [44490] My uncle is presiding there."
939987 [44491] 
939987 [44492] "How, how can I thank you!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once
939987 [44493] more pressing Razumihin's hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.
939987 [44494] 
939987 [44495] "I can't have it! I can't have it!" he repeated irritably, "don't worry
939987 [44496] me! Enough, go away... I can't stand it!"
939987 [44497] 
939987 [44498] "Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute," Dounia
939987 [44499] whispered in dismay; "we are distressing him, that's evident."
939987 [44500] 
939987 [44501] "Mayn't I look at him after three years?" wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [44502] 
939987 [44503] "Stay," he stopped them again, "you keep interrupting me, and my ideas
939987 [44504] get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?"
939987 [44505] 
939987 [44506] "No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,
939987 [44507] that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today," Pulcheria
939987 [44508] Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.
939987 [44509] 
939987 [44510] "Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I'd throw him
939987 [44511] downstairs and told him to go to hell...."
939987 [44512] 
939987 [44513] "Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don't mean to tell us..."
939987 [44514] Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at
939987 [44515] Dounia.
939987 [44516] 
939987 [44517] Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting
939987 [44518] for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from
939987 [44519] Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,
939987 [44520] and were in painful perplexity and suspense.
939987 [44521] 
939987 [44522] "Dounia," Raskolnikov continued with an effort, "I don't want that
939987 [44523] marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,
939987 [44524] so that we may never hear his name again."
939987 [44525] 
939987 [44526] "Good Heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [44527] 
939987 [44528] "Brother, think what you are saying!" Avdotya Romanovna began
939987 [44529] impetuously, but immediately checked herself. "You are not fit to talk
939987 [44530] now, perhaps; you are tired," she added gently.
939987 [44531] 
939987 [44532] "You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_
939987 [44533] sake. But I won't accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before
939987 [44534] to-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will
939987 [44535] be the end of it!"
939987 [44536] 
939987 [44537] "That I can't do!" the girl cried, offended, "what right have you..."
939987 [44538] 
939987 [44539] "Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don't you see..."
939987 [44540] the mother interposed in dismay. "Better come away!"
939987 [44541] 
939987 [44542] "He is raving," Razumihin cried tipsily, "or how would he dare!
939987 [44543] To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did
939987 [44544] drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made
939987 [44545] speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out
939987 [44546] crest-fallen...."
939987 [44547] 
939987 [44548] "Then it's true?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [44549] 
939987 [44550] "Good-bye till to-morrow, brother," said Dounia compassionately--"let us
939987 [44551] go, mother... Good-bye, Rodya."
939987 [44552] 
939987 [44553] "Do you hear, sister," he repeated after them, making a last effort,
939987 [44554] "I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like
939987 [44555] a scoundrel, but you mustn't... one is enough... and though I am a
939987 [44556] scoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister. It's me or Luzhin! Go now...."
939987 [44557] 
939987 [44558] "But you're out of your mind! Despot!" roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov
939987 [44559] did not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and
939987 [44560] turned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with
939987 [44561] interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively
939987 [44562] started at her glance.
939987 [44563] 
939987 [44564] Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
939987 [44565] 
939987 [44566] "Nothing would induce me to go," she whispered in despair to Razumihin.
939987 [44567] "I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home."
939987 [44568] 
939987 [44569] "You'll spoil everything," Razumihin answered in the same whisper,
939987 [44570] losing patience--"come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a
939987 [44571] light! I assure you," he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--"that
939987 [44572] he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you
939987 [44573] understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not
939987 [44574] to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once
939987 [44575] and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this
939987 [44576] time of night, and will do himself some mischief...."
939987 [44577] 
939987 [44578] "What are you saying?"
939987 [44579] 
939987 [44580] "And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left in those lodgings without
939987 [44581] you. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [44582] couldn't find you better lodgings... But you know I've had a little to
939987 [44583] drink, and that's what makes me... swear; don't mind it...."
939987 [44584] 
939987 [44585] "But I'll go to the landlady here," Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,
939987 [44586] "I'll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I
939987 [44587] can't leave him like that, I cannot!"
939987 [44588] 
939987 [44589] This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady's
939987 [44590] door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in
939987 [44591] extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing
939987 [44592] Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of
939987 [44593] it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he
939987 [44594] had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he
939987 [44595] had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with
939987 [44596] the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving
939987 [44597] them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every
939987 [44598] word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their
939987 [44599] hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the
939987 [44600] least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of
939987 [44601] his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew
939987 [44602] them all the closer to him. If they'd told him to jump head foremost
939987 [44603] from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation
939987 [44604] in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man
939987 [44605] was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety
939987 [44606] over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was
939987 [44607] unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna
939987 [44608] shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not
939987 [44609] see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It
939987 [44610] was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya's account of her
939987 [44611] brother's queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from
939987 [44612] him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,
939987 [44613] that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,
939987 [44614] however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of
939987 [44615] Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might
939987 [44616] be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.
939987 [44617] 
939987 [44618] "You can't go to the landlady, that's perfect nonsense!" he cried. "If
939987 [44619] you stay, though you are his mother, you'll drive him to a frenzy, and
939987 [44620] then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I'll tell you what I'll
939987 [44621] do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I'll conduct you both home, you
939987 [44622] can't be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that
939987 [44623] way.... But no matter! Then I'll run straight back here and a quarter of
939987 [44624] an hour later, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news how he is,
939987 [44625] whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I'll run home in
939987 [44626] a twinkling--I've a lot of friends there, all drunk--I'll fetch
939987 [44627] Zossimov--that's the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,
939987 [44628] but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I'll drag him
939987 [44629] to Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two reports in the
939987 [44630] hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that's a
939987 [44631] very different thing from my account of him! If there's anything wrong,
939987 [44632] I swear I'll bring you here myself, but, if it's all right, you go to
939987 [44633] bed. And I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he won't hear me,
939987 [44634] and I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady's, to be at hand. Which
939987 [44635] is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the
939987 [44636] landlady is out of the question; it's all right for me, but it's out of
939987 [44637] the question for you: she wouldn't take you, for she's... for she's a
939987 [44638] fool... She'd be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,
939987 [44639] too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an
939987 [44640] absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...
939987 [44641] No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?"
939987 [44642] 
939987 [44643] "Let us go, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna, "he will certainly do what
939987 [44644] he has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really
939987 [44645] will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?"
939987 [44646] 
939987 [44647] "You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!"
939987 [44648] Razumihin cried in ecstasy, "let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit
939987 [44649] with him with a light; I'll come in a quarter of an hour."
939987 [44650] 
939987 [44651] Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no
939987 [44652] further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down
939987 [44653] the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and
939987 [44654] good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in
939987 [44655] such a condition....
939987 [44656] 
939987 [44657] "Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!" Razumihin broke in upon
939987 [44658] her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge
939987 [44659] steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he
939987 [44660] did not observe, however. "Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,
939987 [44661] but that's not it; I am not drunk from wine. It's seeing you has turned
939987 [44662] my head... But don't mind me! Don't take any notice: I am talking
939987 [44663] nonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The
939987 [44664] minute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over
939987 [44665] my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only
939987 [44666] you knew how I love you both! Don't laugh, and don't be angry! You may
939987 [44667] be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I
939987 [44668] am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year
939987 [44669] there was a moment... though it wasn't a presentiment really, for
939987 [44670] you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan't sleep all
939987 [44671] night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...
939987 [44672] that's why he mustn't be irritated."
939987 [44673] 
939987 [44674] "What do you say?" cried the mother.
939987 [44675] 
939987 [44676] "Did the doctor really say that?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.
939987 [44677] 
939987 [44678] "Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a
939987 [44679] powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been
939987 [44680] better if you had come to-morrow. It's a good thing we went away. And in
939987 [44681] an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not
939987 [44682] drunk! And I shan't be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because
939987 [44683] they got me into an argument, damn them! I've sworn never to argue! They
939987 [44684] talk such trash! I almost came to blows! I've left my uncle to preside.
939987 [44685] Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism
939987 [44686] and that's just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike
939987 [44687] themselves as they can. That's what they regard as the highest point of
939987 [44688] progress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is..."
939987 [44689] 
939987 [44690] "Listen!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added
939987 [44691] fuel to the flames.
939987 [44692] 
939987 [44693] "What do you think?" shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, "you think I
939987 [44694] am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk
939987 [44695] nonsense. That's man's one privilege over all creation. Through error
939987 [44696] you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any
939987 [44697] truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and
939987 [44698] fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even make
939987 [44699] mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,
939987 [44700] and I'll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one's own way is better than
939987 [44701] to go right in someone else's. In the first case you are a man, in the
939987 [44702] second you're no better than a bird. Truth won't escape you, but life
939987 [44703] can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?
939987 [44704] In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,
939987 [44705] judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are
939987 [44706] still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other
939987 [44707] people's ideas, it's what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?" cried
939987 [44708] Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies' hands.
939987 [44709] 
939987 [44710] "Oh, mercy, I do not know," cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [44711] 
939987 [44712] "Yes, yes... though I don't agree with you in everything," added Avdotya
939987 [44713] Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand
939987 [44714] so painfully.
939987 [44715] 
939987 [44716] "Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you..." he cried in
939987 [44717] a transport, "you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and
939987 [44718] perfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss
939987 [44719] your hands here at once, on my knees..." and he fell on his knees on the
939987 [44720] pavement, fortunately at that time deserted.
939987 [44721] 
939987 [44722] "Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [44723] cried, greatly distressed.
939987 [44724] 
939987 [44725] "Get up, get up!" said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.
939987 [44726] 
939987 [44727] "Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That's it! Enough! I
939987 [44728] get up and we'll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and
939987 [44729] drunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do
939987 [44730] homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And
939987 [44731] I've done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya
939987 [44732] was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how
939987 [44733] dare he put you in such lodgings! It's a scandal! Do you know the
939987 [44734] sort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are
939987 [44735] his betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I'll tell you, your _fiancÃ©_ is a
939987 [44736] scoundrel."
939987 [44737] 
939987 [44738] "Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting..." Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [44739] was beginning.
939987 [44740] 
939987 [44741] "Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,"
939987 [44742] Razumihin made haste to apologise. "But... but you can't be angry with
939987 [44743] me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!
939987 [44744] That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I'm in... hm! Well,
939987 [44745] anyway, I won't say why, I daren't.... But we all saw to-day when he
939987 [44746] came in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair
939987 [44747] curled at the barber's, not because he was in such a hurry to show his
939987 [44748] wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint
939987 [44749] and a buffoon. That's evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a
939987 [44750] fool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,
939987 [44751] ladies?" he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, "though
939987 [44752] all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we
939987 [44753] do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the
939987 [44754] truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...
939987 [44755] is not on the right path. Though I've been calling them all sorts of
939987 [44756] names just now, I do respect them all... though I don't respect Zametov,
939987 [44757] I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he
939987 [44758] is an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it's all said and
939987 [44759] forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let's go on. I know this corridor,
939987 [44760] I've been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you
939987 [44761] here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.
939987 [44762] Don't let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I'll come back with news,
939987 [44763] and half an hour later I'll bring Zossimov, you'll see! Good-bye, I'll
939987 [44764] run."
939987 [44765] 
939987 [44766] "Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?" said Pulcheria
939987 [44767] Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.
939987 [44768] 
939987 [44769] "Don't worry yourself, mother," said Dounia, taking off her hat and
939987 [44770] cape. "God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a
939987 [44771] drinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has
939987 [44772] done for Rodya...."
939987 [44773] 
939987 [44774] "Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring
939987 [44775] myself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied
939987 [44776] our meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us...."
939987 [44777] 
939987 [44778] Tears came into her eyes.
939987 [44779] 
939987 [44780] "No, it's not that, mother. You didn't see, you were crying all the
939987 [44781] time. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that's the reason."
939987 [44782] 
939987 [44783] "Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked
939987 [44784] to you, Dounia!" said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,
939987 [44785] trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia's
939987 [44786] standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven
939987 [44787] him. "I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow," she added,
939987 [44788] probing her further.
939987 [44789] 
939987 [44790] "And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,"
939987 [44791] Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going
939987 [44792] beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
939987 [44793] afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter
939987 [44794] warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait
939987 [44795] anxiously for Razumihin's return, timidly watching her daughter who
939987 [44796] walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.
939987 [44797] This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya
939987 [44798] Romanovna's and the mother was always afraid to break in on her
939987 [44799] daughter's mood at such moments.
939987 [44800] 
939987 [44801] Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation
939987 [44802] for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many
939987 [44803] people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya
939987 [44804] Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and
939987 [44805] fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was
939987 [44806] remarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,
939987 [44807] strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every
939987 [44808] gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
939987 [44809] softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she
939987 [44810] might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a
939987 [44811] little lighter than her brother's; there was a proud light in her almost
939987 [44812] black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was
939987 [44813] pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness
939987 [44814] and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected
939987 [44815] a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful
939987 [44816] face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty
939987 [44817] expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;
939987 [44818] but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,
939987 [44819] laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,
939987 [44820] simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone
939987 [44821] like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head
939987 [44822] immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the
939987 [44823] first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at
939987 [44824] meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation
939987 [44825] at her brother's insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was
939987 [44826] sealed.
939987 [44827] 
939987 [44828] He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken
939987 [44829] talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov's eccentric
939987 [44830] landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of
939987 [44831] Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
939987 [44832] forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she
939987 [44833] looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the
939987 [44834] case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure
939987 [44835] sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to
939987 [44836] preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her
939987 [44837] hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow's
939987 [44838] foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from
939987 [44839] anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia
939987 [44840] over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.
939987 [44841] Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and
939987 [44842] yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a
939987 [44843] great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a
939987 [44844] certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions
939987 [44845] which nothing would induce her to cross.
939987 [44846] 
939987 [44847] Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin's departure, there came two
939987 [44848] subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
939987 [44849] 
939987 [44850] "I won't come in, I haven't time," he hastened to say when the door was
939987 [44851] opened. "He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may
939987 [44852] sleep ten hours. Nastasya's with him; I told her not to leave till I
939987 [44853] came. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you'd
939987 [44854] better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything...."
939987 [44855] 
939987 [44856] And he ran off down the corridor.
939987 [44857] 
939987 [44858] "What a very competent and... devoted young man!" cried Pulcheria
939987 [44859] Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
939987 [44860] 
939987 [44861] "He seems a splendid person!" Avdotya Romanovna replied with some
939987 [44862] warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.
939987 [44863] 
939987 [44864] It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor
939987 [44865] and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely
939987 [44866] relying on Razumihin's promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing
939987 [44867] Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to
939987 [44868] go to Raskolnikov's, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest
939987 [44869] suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated
939987 [44870] condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw
939987 [44871] that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten
939987 [44872] minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria
939987 [44873] Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and
939987 [44874] extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.
939987 [44875] He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the
939987 [44876] slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two
939987 [44877] ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya
939987 [44878] Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and
939987 [44879] addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him
939987 [44880] extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the
939987 [44881] invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his
939987 [44882] observations the patient's illness was due partly to his unfortunate
939987 [44883] material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also
939987 [44884] a moral origin, "was, so to speak, the product of several material and
939987 [44885] moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...
939987 [44886] and so on." Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his
939987 [44887] words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this
939987 [44888] theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna's anxiously and timidly inquiring as
939987 [44889] to "some suspicion of insanity," he replied with a composed and candid
939987 [44890] smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
939987 [44891] had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,
939987 [44892] was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
939987 [44893] that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
939987 [44894] delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
939987 [44895] a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, "if only all
939987 [44896] fresh shocks can be avoided," he added significantly. Then he got up,
939987 [44897] took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm
939987 [44898] gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna
939987 [44899] spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased
939987 [44900] with his visit and still more so with himself.
939987 [44901] 
939987 [44902] "We'll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!" Razumihin said in conclusion,
939987 [44903] following Zossimov out. "I'll be with you to-morrow morning as early as
939987 [44904] possible with my report."
939987 [44905] 
939987 [44906] "That's a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna," remarked Zossimov,
939987 [44907] almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.
939987 [44908] 
939987 [44909] "Fetching? You said fetching?" roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov
939987 [44910] and seized him by the throat. "If you ever dare.... Do you understand?
939987 [44911] Do you understand?" he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing
939987 [44912] him against the wall. "Do you hear?"
939987 [44913] 
939987 [44914] "Let me go, you drunken devil," said Zossimov, struggling and when he
939987 [44915] had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.
939987 [44916] Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.
939987 [44917] 
939987 [44918] "Of course, I am an ass," he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, "but
939987 [44919] still... you are another."
939987 [44920] 
939987 [44921] "No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly."
939987 [44922] 
939987 [44923] They walked along in silence and only when they were close to
939987 [44924] Raskolnikov's lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable
939987 [44925] anxiety.
939987 [44926] 
939987 [44927] "Listen," he said, "you're a first-rate fellow, but among your other
939987 [44928] failings, you're a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You
939987 [44929] are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you're getting fat
939987 [44930] and lazy and can't deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because
939987 [44931] it leads one straight into the dirt. You've let yourself get so slack
939987 [44932] that I don't know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.
939987 [44933] You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your
939987 [44934] patients! In another three or four years you won't get up for your
939987 [44935] patients... But hang it all, that's not the point!... You are going
939987 [44936] to spend to-night in the landlady's flat here. (Hard work I've had to
939987 [44937] persuade her!) And I'll be in the kitchen. So here's a chance for you to
939987 [44938] get to know her better.... It's not as you think! There's not a trace of
939987 [44939] anything of the sort, brother...!"
939987 [44940] 
939987 [44941] "But I don't think!"
939987 [44942] 
939987 [44943] "Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage
939987 [44944] virtue... and yet she's sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!
939987 [44945] Save me from her, by all that's unholy! She's most prepossessing... I'll
939987 [44946] repay you, I'll do anything...."
939987 [44947] 
939987 [44948] Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.
939987 [44949] 
939987 [44950] "Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?"
939987 [44951] 
939987 [44952] "It won't be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,
939987 [44953] as long as you sit by her and talk. You're a doctor, too; try curing
939987 [44954] her of something. I swear you won't regret it. She has a piano, and you
939987 [44955] know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: 'I
939987 [44956] shed hot tears.' She likes the genuine article--and well, it all
939987 [44957] began with that song; Now you're a regular performer, a _maÃ®tre_, a
939987 [44958] Rubinstein.... I assure you, you won't regret it!"
939987 [44959] 
939987 [44960] "But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of
939987 [44961] marriage, perhaps?"
939987 [44962] 
939987 [44963] "Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not
939987 [44964] that sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that...."
939987 [44965] 
939987 [44966] "Well then, drop her!"
939987 [44967] 
939987 [44968] "But I can't drop her like that!"
939987 [44969] 
939987 [44970] "Why can't you?"
939987 [44971] 
939987 [44972] "Well, I can't, that's all about it! There's an element of attraction
939987 [44973] here, brother."
939987 [44974] 
939987 [44975] "Then why have you fascinated her?"
939987 [44976] 
939987 [44977] "I haven't fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.
939987 [44978] But she won't care a straw whether it's you or I, so long as somebody
939987 [44979] sits beside her, sighing.... I can't explain the position, brother...
939987 [44980] look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin
939987 [44981] teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I'm not joking, I'm
939987 [44982] in earnest, it'll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh
939987 [44983] for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time
939987 [44984] about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she
939987 [44985] just sighed and perspired! And you mustn't talk of love--she's bashful
939987 [44986] to hysterics--but just let her see you can't tear yourself away--that's
939987 [44987] enough. It's fearfully comfortable; you're quite at home, you can
939987 [44988] read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you're
939987 [44989] careful."
939987 [44990] 
939987 [44991] "But what do I want with her?"
939987 [44992] 
939987 [44993] "Ach, I can't make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!
939987 [44994] I have often been reminded of you!... You'll come to it in the end! So
939987 [44995] does it matter whether it's sooner or later? There's the feather-bed
939987 [44996] element here, brother--ach! and not only that! There's an attraction
939987 [44997] here--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,
939987 [44998] the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the
939987 [44999] world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening
939987 [45000] samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as
939987 [45001] snug as though you were dead, and yet you're alive--the advantages
939987 [45002] of both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I'm talking, it's
939987 [45003] bedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I'll go in and look at
939987 [45004] him. But there's no need, it's all right. Don't you worry yourself,
939987 [45005] yet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice
939987 [45006] anything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can't be...."
939987 [45007] 
939987 [45008] 
939987 [45009] 
939987 [45010] CHAPTER II
939987 [45011] 
939987 [45012] Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious.
939987 [45013] He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
939987 [45014] He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He
939987 [45015] remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly
939987 [45016] novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression
939987 [45017] unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised
939987 [45018] clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly
939987 [45019] unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and
939987 [45020] he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties
939987 [45021] bequeathed him by that "thrice accursed yesterday."
939987 [45022] 
939987 [45023] The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown
939987 [45024] himself "base and mean," not only because he had been drunk, but
939987 [45025] because he had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuse
939987 [45026] her _fiancÃ©_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual
939987 [45027] relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And
939987 [45028] what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?
939987 [45029] Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as
939987 [45030] Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there
939987 [45031] must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know
939987 [45032] the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how
939987 [45033] despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?
939987 [45034] Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the
939987 [45035] truth had all come out, "that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse
939987 [45036] and envious heart"! And would such a dream ever be permissible to
939987 [45037] him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy
939987 [45038] braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical
939987 [45039] a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and
939987 [45040] suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had
939987 [45041] said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of
939987 [45042] Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist
939987 [45043] down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the
939987 [45044] bricks flying.
939987 [45045] 
939987 [45046] "Of course," he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of
939987 [45047] self-abasement, "of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or
939987 [45048] smoothed over... and so it's useless even to think of it, and I must
939987 [45049] go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask
939987 [45050] forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!"
939987 [45051] 
939987 [45052] And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.
939987 [45053] He hadn't another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put it
939987 [45054] on. "I would have made a point of not putting it on." But in any case he
939987 [45055] could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend
939987 [45056] the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his
939987 [45057] assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.
939987 [45058] His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.
939987 [45059] 
939987 [45060] He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he
939987 [45061] washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the
939987 [45062] question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna
939987 [45063] had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question
939987 [45064] was angrily answered in the negative. "Let it stay as it is! What if
939987 [45065] they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think
939987 [45066] so! Not on any account!"
939987 [45067] 
939987 [45068] "And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the
939987 [45069] manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had
939987 [45070] some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be
939987 [45071] proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all
939987 [45072] the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly
939987 [45073] dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to
939987 [45074] set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he'd
939987 [45075] make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he
939987 [45076] wouldn't care! He'd be worse!"
939987 [45077] 
939987 [45078] He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night
939987 [45079] in Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in.
939987 [45080] 
939987 [45081] He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
939987 [45082] Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
939987 [45083] Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him and promised to see
939987 [45084] him again about eleven.
939987 [45085] 
939987 [45086] "If he is still at home," he added. "Damn it all! If one can't control
939987 [45087] one's patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will
939987 [45088] go to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?"
939987 [45089] 
939987 [45090] "They are coming, I think," said Razumihin, understanding the object
939987 [45091] of the question, "and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.
939987 [45092] I'll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I."
939987 [45093] 
939987 [45094] "But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plenty
939987 [45095] to do besides looking after them."
939987 [45096] 
939987 [45097] "One thing worries me," interposed Razumihin, frowning. "On the way home
939987 [45098] I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and
939987 [45099] amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane."
939987 [45100] 
939987 [45101] "You told the ladies so, too."
939987 [45102] 
939987 [45103] "I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so
939987 [45104] seriously?"
939987 [45105] 
939987 [45106] "That's nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,
939987 [45107] yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to
939987 [45108] him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with
939987 [45109] your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,
939987 [45110] perhaps, mad on that very point! If only I'd known what happened then
939987 [45111] at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this
939987 [45112] suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.
939987 [45113] These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and
939987 [45114] see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was
939987 [45115] Zametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I
939987 [45116] know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat
939987 [45117] of a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he made
939987 [45118] every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police
939987 [45119] officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half
939987 [45120] frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That
939987 [45121] may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it
939987 [45122] all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but
939987 [45123] hm... he shouldn't have told all that last night. He is an awful
939987 [45124] chatterbox!"
939987 [45125] 
939987 [45126] "But whom did he tell it to? You and me?"
939987 [45127] 
939987 [45128] "And Porfiry."
939987 [45129] 
939987 [45130] "What does that matter?"
939987 [45131] 
939987 [45132] "And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?
939987 [45133] Tell them to be more careful with him to-day...."
939987 [45134] 
939987 [45135] "They'll get on all right!" Razumihin answered reluctantly.
939987 [45136] 
939987 [45137] "Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn't
939987 [45138] seem to dislike him... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?"
939987 [45139] 
939987 [45140] "But what business is it of yours?" Razumihin cried with annoyance. "How
939987 [45141] can I tell whether they've a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps
939987 [45142] you'll find out...."
939987 [45143] 
939987 [45144] "Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night's wine has not gone off
939987 [45145] yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night's
939987 [45146] lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through
939987 [45147] the door; she was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into her
939987 [45148] from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview...."
939987 [45149] 
939987 [45150] At nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's
939987 [45151] house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They
939987 [45152] had risen at seven o'clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as
939987 [45153] night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He
939987 [45154] had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at
939987 [45155] him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced
939987 [45156] timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that
939987 [45157] moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such
939987 [45158] complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and
939987 [45159] ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater
939987 [45160] confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a
939987 [45161] subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.
939987 [45162] 
939987 [45163] Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,
939987 [45164] Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because
939987 [45165] "she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over
939987 [45166] beforehand." Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation
939987 [45167] to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya
939987 [45168] Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and
939987 [45169] they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such
939987 [45170] a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin
939987 [45171] vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped
939987 [45172] in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's
939987 [45173] questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.
939987 [45174] 
939987 [45175] He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted
939987 [45176] by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the
939987 [45177] most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life,
939987 [45178] concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,
939987 [45179] however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at
939987 [45180] the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly
939987 [45181] to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his
939987 [45182] listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.
939987 [45183] 
939987 [45184] "Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don't know
939987 [45185] your name!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.
939987 [45186] 
939987 [45187] "Dmitri Prokofitch."
939987 [45188] 
939987 [45189] "I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he
939987 [45190] looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are
939987 [45191] his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,
939987 [45192] what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is
939987 [45193] he now? In a word, I should like..."
939987 [45194] 
939987 [45195] "Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?" observed Dounia.
939987 [45196] 
939987 [45197] "Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,
939987 [45198] Dmitri Prokofitch!"
939987 [45199] 
939987 [45200] "Naturally," answered Razumihin. "I have no mother, but my uncle comes
939987 [45201] every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in
939987 [45202] appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years' separation
939987 [45203] means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for
939987 [45204] a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of
939987 [45205] late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and
939987 [45206] fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like
939987 [45207] showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his
939987 [45208] heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply
939987 [45209] cold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he were alternating between
939987 [45210] two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is
939987 [45211] so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing
939987 [45212] nothing. He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, but
939987 [45213] as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles. He never listens
939987 [45214] to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other
939987 [45215] people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps
939987 [45216] he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most
939987 [45217] beneficial influence upon him."
939987 [45218] 
939987 [45219] "God grant it may," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by
939987 [45220] Razumihin's account of her Rodya.
939987 [45221] 
939987 [45222] And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
939987 [45223] He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and
939987 [45224] looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening
939987 [45225] attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her
939987 [45226] arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,
939987 [45227] without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to
939987 [45228] what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
939987 [45229] white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of
939987 [45230] extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed
939987 [45231] like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps
939987 [45232] just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery
939987 [45233] of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be
939987 [45234] afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very
939987 [45235] trying for a man who already felt diffident.
939987 [45236] 
939987 [45237] "You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother's
939987 [45238] character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you
939987 [45239] were too uncritically devoted to him," observed Avdotya Romanovna with
939987 [45240] a smile. "I think you are right that he needs a woman's care," she added
939987 [45241] thoughtfully.
939987 [45242] 
939987 [45243] "I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only..."
939987 [45244] 
939987 [45245] "What?"
939987 [45246] 
939987 [45247] "He loves no one and perhaps he never will," Razumihin declared
939987 [45248] decisively.
939987 [45249] 
939987 [45250] "You mean he is not capable of love?"
939987 [45251] 
939987 [45252] "Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in
939987 [45253] everything, indeed!" he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but
939987 [45254] remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,
939987 [45255] he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya
939987 [45256] Romanovna couldn't help laughing when she looked at him.
939987 [45257] 
939987 [45258] "You may both be mistaken about Rodya," Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,
939987 [45259] slightly piqued. "I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.
939987 [45260] What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have
939987 [45261] supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how
939987 [45262] moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what
939987 [45263] he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might
939987 [45264] do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for
939987 [45265] instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave
939987 [45266] me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that
939987 [45267] girl--what was her name--his landlady's daughter?"
939987 [45268] 
939987 [45269] "Did you hear about that affair?" asked Avdotya Romanovna.
939987 [45270] 
939987 [45271] "Do you suppose----" Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. "Do you
939987 [45272] suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from
939987 [45273] grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have
939987 [45274] disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn't that he doesn't love us!"
939987 [45275] 
939987 [45276] "He has never spoken a word of that affair to me," Razumihin answered
939987 [45277] cautiously. "But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,
939987 [45278] though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was
939987 [45279] rather strange."
939987 [45280] 
939987 [45281] "And what did you hear?" both the ladies asked at once.
939987 [45282] 
939987 [45283] "Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which
939987 [45284] only failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all to
939987 [45285] Praskovya Pavlovna's liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all
939987 [45286] pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and
939987 [45287] queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have
939987 [45288] had some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She had no money
939987 [45289] either and he wouldn't have considered her money.... But it's always
939987 [45290] difficult to judge in such matters."
939987 [45291] 
939987 [45292] "I am sure she was a good girl," Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.
939987 [45293] 
939987 [45294] "God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don't know
939987 [45295] which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her
939987 [45296] or she to him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began
939987 [45297] tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with
939987 [45298] Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to
939987 [45299] the latter's annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently
939987 [45300] caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in
939987 [45301] detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly
939987 [45302] blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not
939987 [45303] seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.
939987 [45304] 
939987 [45305] "He had planned it before his illness," he added.
939987 [45306] 
939987 [45307] "I think so, too," Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.
939987 [45308] But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself
939987 [45309] so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.
939987 [45310] Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.
939987 [45311] 
939987 [45312] "So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [45313] could not resist asking.
939987 [45314] 
939987 [45315] "I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband,"
939987 [45316] Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, "and I don't say it simply
939987 [45317] from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna
939987 [45318] has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so
939987 [45319] rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...
939987 [45320] mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this
939987 [45321] morning I am ashamed of it."
939987 [45322] 
939987 [45323] He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not
939987 [45324] break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began
939987 [45325] to speak of Luzhin.
939987 [45326] 
939987 [45327] Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what
939987 [45328] to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she
939987 [45329] confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.
939987 [45330] 
939987 [45331] "You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. "I'll be perfectly open with
939987 [45332] Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?"
939987 [45333] 
939987 [45334] "Of course, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.
939987 [45335] 
939987 [45336] "This is what it is," she began in haste, as though the permission to
939987 [45337] speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. "Very early this
939987 [45338] morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter
939987 [45339] announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you
939987 [45340] know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these
939987 [45341] lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would
939987 [45342] be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.
939987 [45343] You'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me
939987 [45344] very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid
939987 [45345] opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya's character better than
939987 [45346] anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell
939987 [45347] you, made her decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to act
939987 [45348] and I... I've been waiting for your opinion."
939987 [45349] 
939987 [45350] Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read
939987 [45351] as follows:
939987 [45352] 
939987 [45353] "Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you
939987 [45354] that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at
939987 [45355] the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object
939987 [45356] in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with
939987 [45357] you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of
939987 [45358] delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you
939987 [45359] are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have
939987 [45360] the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings
939987 [45361] not later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, and
939987 [45362] herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative
939987 [45363] request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as
939987 [45364] he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my
939987 [45365] visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire
939987 [45366] from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation
939987 [45367] upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own
939987 [45368] interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,
939987 [45369] that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be
939987 [45370] compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to
939987 [45371] blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so
939987 [45372] ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able
939987 [45373] to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief
939987 [45374] by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who
939987 [45375] was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of
939987 [45376] notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the
939987 [45377] funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to
939987 [45378] raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable
939987 [45379] daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage
939987 [45380] of
939987 [45381] 
939987 [45382] "Your humble servant,
939987 [45383] 
939987 [45384] "P. LUZHIN."
939987 [45385] 
939987 [45386] 
939987 [45387] "What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?" began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
939987 [45388] almost weeping. "How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted
939987 [45389] so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not
939987 [45390] to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will
939987 [45391] happen then?"
939987 [45392] 
939987 [45393] "Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision," Razumihin answered calmly at
939987 [45394] once.
939987 [45395] 
939987 [45396] "Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn't
939987 [45397] explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that
939987 [45398] it would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya should
939987 [45399] make a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet....
939987 [45400] I didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him
939987 [45401] from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so
939987 [45402] irritable.... Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who died
939987 [45403] and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the
939987 [45404] money... which..."
939987 [45405] 
939987 [45406] "Which cost you such sacrifice, mother," put in Avdotya Romanovna.
939987 [45407] 
939987 [45408] "He was not himself yesterday," Razumihin said thoughtfully, "if you
939987 [45409] only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there
939987 [45410] was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home
939987 [45411] yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand
939987 [45412] a word.... But last night, I myself..."
939987 [45413] 
939987 [45414] "The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and
939987 [45415] there I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done. Besides,
939987 [45416] it's getting late--good heavens, it's past ten," she cried looking at
939987 [45417] a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin
939987 [45418] Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her
939987 [45419] dress. "A present from her _fiancÃ©_," thought Razumihin.
939987 [45420] 
939987 [45421] "We must start, Dounia, we must start," her mother cried in a flutter.
939987 [45422] "He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming
939987 [45423] so late. Merciful heavens!"
939987 [45424] 
939987 [45425] While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;
939987 [45426] Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were
939987 [45427] not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty
939987 [45428] gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in
939987 [45429] people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently
939987 [45430] at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. "The queen who mended her
939987 [45431] stockings in prison," he thought, "must have looked then every inch a
939987 [45432] queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levÃ©es."
939987 [45433] 
939987 [45434] "My God!" exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "little did I think that I
939987 [45435] should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,
939987 [45436] Dmitri Prokofitch," she added, glancing at him timidly.
939987 [45437] 
939987 [45438] "Don't be afraid, mother," said Dounia, kissing her, "better have faith
939987 [45439] in him."
939987 [45440] 
939987 [45441] "Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept all night,"
939987 [45442] exclaimed the poor woman.
939987 [45443] 
939987 [45444] They came out into the street.
939987 [45445] 
939987 [45446] "Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of
939987 [45447] Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took
939987 [45448] my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were
939987 [45449] blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don't know, Dmitri
939987 [45450] Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!"
939987 [45451] 
939987 [45452] "No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?"
939987 [45453] 
939987 [45454] "She died suddenly; and only fancy..."
939987 [45455] 
939987 [45456] "Afterwards, mamma," put in Dounia. "He doesn't know who Marfa Petrovna
939987 [45457] is."
939987 [45458] 
939987 [45459] "Ah, you don't know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.
939987 [45460] Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don't know what I am thinking about
939987 [45461] these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and
939987 [45462] so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a
939987 [45463] relation.... Don't be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what's the
939987 [45464] matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?"
939987 [45465] 
939987 [45466] "Yes, I bruised it," muttered Razumihin overjoyed.
939987 [45467] 
939987 [45468] "I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault
939987 [45469] with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether
939987 [45470] he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,
939987 [45471] you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy
939987 [45472] him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to
939987 [45473] treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know."
939987 [45474] 
939987 [45475] "Don't question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don't
939987 [45476] ask him too much about his health; he doesn't like that."
939987 [45477] 
939987 [45478] "Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the
939987 [45479] stairs.... What an awful staircase!"
939987 [45480] 
939987 [45481] "Mother, you are quite pale, don't distress yourself, darling," said
939987 [45482] Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: "He ought to be
939987 [45483] happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so."
939987 [45484] 
939987 [45485] "Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he has waked up."
939987 [45486] 
939987 [45487] The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they
939987 [45488] reached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her
939987 [45489] door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching
939987 [45490] them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was
939987 [45491] suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried
939987 [45492] out.
939987 [45493] 
939987 [45494] 
939987 [45495] 
939987 [45496] CHAPTER III
939987 [45497] 
939987 [45498] "He is well, quite well!" Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.
939987 [45499] 
939987 [45500] He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place
939987 [45501] as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,
939987 [45502] fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for
939987 [45503] some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed
939987 [45504] to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.
939987 [45505] 
939987 [45506] Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the
939987 [45507] day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like
939987 [45508] a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
939987 [45509] His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke
939987 [45510] little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a
939987 [45511] restlessness in his movements.
939987 [45512] 
939987 [45513] He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete
939987 [45514] the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The
939987 [45515] pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister
939987 [45516] entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in
939987 [45517] place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look
939987 [45518] of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient
939987 [45519] with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed
939987 [45520] in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of
939987 [45521] bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable
939987 [45522] torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following
939987 [45523] conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But
939987 [45524] at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself
939987 [45525] and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a
939987 [45526] monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
939987 [45527] 
939987 [45528] "Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well," said Raskolnikov,
939987 [45529] giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria
939987 [45530] Alexandrovna radiant at once. "And I don't say this _as I did
939987 [45531] yesterday_," he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of
939987 [45532] his hand.
939987 [45533] 
939987 [45534] "Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day," began Zossimov, much
939987 [45535] delighted at the ladies' entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping
939987 [45536] up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. "In another three or
939987 [45537] four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,
939987 [45538] as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been
939987 [45539] coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been
939987 [45540] perhaps your own fault?" he added, with a tentative smile, as though
939987 [45541] still afraid of irritating him.
939987 [45542] 
939987 [45543] "It is very possible," answered Raskolnikov coldly.
939987 [45544] 
939987 [45545] "I should say, too," continued Zossimov with zest, "that your complete
939987 [45546] recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,
939987 [45547] I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the
939987 [45548] elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your
939987 [45549] morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go
939987 [45550] from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don't know, but they must
939987 [45551] be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed
939987 [45552] yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement
939987 [45553] coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without
939987 [45554] occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I
939987 [45555] fancy, be very beneficial."
939987 [45556] 
939987 [45557] "Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to
939987 [45558] the university: and then everything will go smoothly...."
939987 [45559] 
939987 [45560] Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before
939987 [45561] the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his
939987 [45562] patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted
939987 [45563] an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking
939987 [45564] Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
939987 [45565] 
939987 [45566] "What! he saw you last night?" Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.
939987 [45567] "Then you have not slept either after your journey."
939987 [45568] 
939987 [45569] "Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o'clock. Dounia and I never go to
939987 [45570] bed before two at home."
939987 [45571] 
939987 [45572] "I don't know how to thank him either," Raskolnikov went on,
939987 [45573] suddenly frowning and looking down. "Setting aside the question of
939987 [45574] payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I
939987 [45575] really don't know what I have done to deserve such special attention
939987 [45576] from you! I simply don't understand it... and... and... it weighs upon
939987 [45577] me, indeed, because I don't understand it. I tell you so candidly."
939987 [45578] 
939987 [45579] "Don't be irritated." Zossimov forced himself to laugh. "Assume that you
939987 [45580] are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love
939987 [45581] our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in
939987 [45582] love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients."
939987 [45583] 
939987 [45584] "I say nothing about him," added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,
939987 [45585] "though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble."
939987 [45586] 
939987 [45587] "What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,
939987 [45588] are you?" shouted Razumihin.
939987 [45589] 
939987 [45590] If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no
939987 [45591] trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.
939987 [45592] But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching
939987 [45593] her brother.
939987 [45594] 
939987 [45595] "As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak," he went on, as though
939987 [45596] repeating a lesson learned by heart. "It is only to-day that I have
939987 [45597] been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here
939987 [45598] yesterday, waiting for me to come back."
939987 [45599] 
939987 [45600] When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,
939987 [45601] smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real
939987 [45602] unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his
939987 [45603] hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her
939987 [45604] since their dispute the previous day. The mother's face lighted up
939987 [45605] with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken
939987 [45606] reconciliation. "Yes, that is what I love him for," Razumihin,
939987 [45607] exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his
939987 [45608] chair. "He has these movements."
939987 [45609] 
939987 [45610] "And how well he does it all," the mother was thinking to herself. "What
939987 [45611] generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end
939987 [45612] to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his
939987 [45613] hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what
939987 [45614] fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better
939987 [45615] looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly
939987 [45616] he's dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, is
939987 [45617] better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but
939987 [45618] I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he's so strange! He's talking kindly, but I'm
939987 [45619] afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?..."
939987 [45620] 
939987 [45621] "Oh, Rodya, you wouldn't believe," she began suddenly, in haste to
939987 [45622] answer his words to her, "how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now
939987 [45623] that it's all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can
939987 [45624] tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace
939987 [45625] you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told
939987 [45626] us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away
939987 [45627] from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the
939987 [45628] streets. You can't imagine how we felt! I couldn't help thinking of the
939987 [45629] tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father's--you
939987 [45630] can't remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever
939987 [45631] and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn't pull him out
939987 [45632] till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of
939987 [45633] rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were
939987 [45634] alone, utterly alone," she said plaintively and stopped short,
939987 [45635] suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr
939987 [45636] Petrovitch, although "we are quite happy again."
939987 [45637] 
939987 [45638] "Yes, yes.... Of course it's very annoying...." Raskolnikov muttered in
939987 [45639] reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed
939987 [45640] at him in perplexity.
939987 [45641] 
939987 [45642] "What else was it I wanted to say?" He went on trying to recollect. "Oh,
939987 [45643] yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don't think that I didn't mean
939987 [45644] to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first."
939987 [45645] 
939987 [45646] "What are you saying, Rodya?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,
939987 [45647] was surprised.
939987 [45648] 
939987 [45649] "Is he answering us as a duty?" Dounia wondered. "Is he being reconciled
939987 [45650] and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating
939987 [45651] a lesson?"
939987 [45652] 
939987 [45653] "I've only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing
939987 [45654] to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out
939987 [45655] the blood... I've only just dressed."
939987 [45656] 
939987 [45657] "Blood! What blood?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.
939987 [45658] 
939987 [45659] "Oh, nothing--don't be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about
939987 [45660] yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run
939987 [45661] over... a clerk..."
939987 [45662] 
939987 [45663] "Delirious? But you remember everything!" Razumihin interrupted.
939987 [45664] 
939987 [45665] "That's true," Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. "I
939987 [45666] remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did
939987 [45667] that and went there and said that, I can't clearly explain now."
939987 [45668] 
939987 [45669] "A familiar phenomenon," interposed Zossimov, "actions are sometimes
939987 [45670] performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the
939987 [45671] actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it's
939987 [45672] like a dream."
939987 [45673] 
939987 [45674] "Perhaps it's a good thing really that he should think me almost a
939987 [45675] madman," thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [45676] 
939987 [45677] "Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too," observed
939987 [45678] Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.
939987 [45679] 
939987 [45680] "There is some truth in your observation," the latter replied. "In that
939987 [45681] sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the
939987 [45682] slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we
939987 [45683] must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among
939987 [45684] dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with."
939987 [45685] 
939987 [45686] At the word "madman," carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on
939987 [45687] his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
939987 [45688] 
939987 [45689] Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a
939987 [45690] strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.
939987 [45691] 
939987 [45692] "Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!"
939987 [45693] Razumihin cried hastily.
939987 [45694] 
939987 [45695] "What?" Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. "Oh... I got spattered with
939987 [45696] blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an
939987 [45697] unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave
939987 [45698] away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She's
939987 [45699] a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,
939987 [45700] starving... nothing in the house... there's a daughter, too... perhaps
939987 [45701] you'd have given it yourself if you'd seen them. But I had no right to
939987 [45702] do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
939987 [45703] To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,
939987 [45704] chiens, si vous n'Ãªtes pas contents_." He laughed, "That's right, isn't
939987 [45705] it, Dounia?"
939987 [45706] 
939987 [45707] "No, it's not," answered Dounia firmly.
939987 [45708] 
939987 [45709] "Bah! you, too, have ideals," he muttered, looking at her almost with
939987 [45710] hatred, and smiling sarcastically. "I ought to have considered that....
939987 [45711] Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you... and if you reach a
939987 [45712] line you won't overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,
939987 [45713] maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that's nonsense," he added
939987 [45714] irritably, vexed at being carried away. "I only meant to say that I beg
939987 [45715] your forgiveness, mother," he concluded, shortly and abruptly.
939987 [45716] 
939987 [45717] "That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,"
939987 [45718] said his mother, delighted.
939987 [45719] 
939987 [45720] "Don't be too sure," he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.
939987 [45721] 
939987 [45722] A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this
939987 [45723] conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the
939987 [45724] forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
939987 [45725] 
939987 [45726] "It is as though they were afraid of me," Raskolnikov was thinking
939987 [45727] to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria
939987 [45728] Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.
939987 [45729] 
939987 [45730] "Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much," flashed through
939987 [45731] his mind.
939987 [45732] 
939987 [45733] "Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead," Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [45734] suddenly blurted out.
939987 [45735] 
939987 [45736] "What Marfa Petrovna?"
939987 [45737] 
939987 [45738] "Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna SvidrigaÃ¯lov. I wrote you so much about
939987 [45739] her."
939987 [45740] 
939987 [45741] "A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she's dead! Oh, really?" he roused
939987 [45742] himself suddenly, as if waking up. "What did she die of?"
939987 [45743] 
939987 [45744] "Only imagine, quite suddenly," Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered
939987 [45745] hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. "On the very day I was sending
939987 [45746] you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been
939987 [45747] the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully."
939987 [45748] 
939987 [45749] "Why, were they on such bad terms?" he asked, addressing his sister.
939987 [45750] 
939987 [45751] "Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very
939987 [45752] patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their
939987 [45753] married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All
939987 [45754] of a sudden he seems to have lost patience."
939987 [45755] 
939987 [45756] "Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven
939987 [45757] years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?"
939987 [45758] 
939987 [45759] "No, no, he's an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!" Dounia
939987 [45760] answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into
939987 [45761] thought.
939987 [45762] 
939987 [45763] "That had happened in the morning," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on
939987 [45764] hurriedly. "And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be
939987 [45765] harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used
939987 [45766] to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am
939987 [45767] told...."
939987 [45768] 
939987 [45769] "After the beating?"
939987 [45770] 
939987 [45771] "That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not
939987 [45772] to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was
939987 [45773] undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and
939987 [45774] she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got
939987 [45775] into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!"
939987 [45776] 
939987 [45777] "I should think so," said Zossimov.
939987 [45778] 
939987 [45779] "And did he beat her badly?"
939987 [45780] 
939987 [45781] "What does that matter!" put in Dounia.
939987 [45782] 
939987 [45783] "H'm! But I don't know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,"
939987 [45784] said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.
939987 [45785] 
939987 [45786] "Ah, my dear, I don't know what to talk about," broke from Pulcheria
939987 [45787] Alexandrovna.
939987 [45788] 
939987 [45789] "Why, are you all afraid of me?" he asked, with a constrained smile.
939987 [45790] 
939987 [45791] "That's certainly true," said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at
939987 [45792] her brother. "Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the
939987 [45793] stairs."
939987 [45794] 
939987 [45795] His face worked, as though in convulsion.
939987 [45796] 
939987 [45797] "Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don't be angry, please, Rodya....
939987 [45798] Why did you say that, Dounia?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,
939987 [45799] overwhelmed--"You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the
939987 [45800] train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything
939987 [45801] together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what
939987 [45802] am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy
939987 [45803] now--simply in seeing you, Rodya...."
939987 [45804] 
939987 [45805] "Hush, mother," he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but
939987 [45806] pressing her hand. "We shall have time to speak freely of everything!"
939987 [45807] 
939987 [45808] As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
939987 [45809] pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
939987 [45810] chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to
939987 [45811] him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be
939987 [45812] able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to
939987 [45813] _speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that
939987 [45814] for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not
939987 [45815] looking at anyone walked towards the door.
939987 [45816] 
939987 [45817] "What are you about?" cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.
939987 [45818] 
939987 [45819] He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were
939987 [45820] all looking at him in perplexity.
939987 [45821] 
939987 [45822] "But what are you all so dull for?" he shouted, suddenly and quite
939987 [45823] unexpectedly. "Do say something! What's the use of sitting like this?
939987 [45824] Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
939987 [45825] Come, anything!"
939987 [45826] 
939987 [45827] "Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning
939987 [45828] again," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.
939987 [45829] 
939987 [45830] "What is the matter, Rodya?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.
939987 [45831] 
939987 [45832] "Oh, nothing! I remembered something," he answered, and suddenly
939987 [45833] laughed.
939987 [45834] 
939987 [45835] "Well, if you remembered something; that's all right!... I was beginning
939987 [45836] to think..." muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. "It is time
939987 [45837] for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can..." He made
939987 [45838] his bows, and went out.
939987 [45839] 
939987 [45840] "What an excellent man!" observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [45841] 
939987 [45842] "Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent," Raskolnikov
939987 [45843] began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he
939987 [45844] had not shown till then. "I can't remember where I met him before my
939987 [45845] illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good
939987 [45846] man, too," he nodded at Razumihin. "Do you like him, Dounia?" he asked
939987 [45847] her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
939987 [45848] 
939987 [45849] "Very much," answered Dounia.
939987 [45850] 
939987 [45851] "Foo!--what a pig you are!" Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible
939987 [45852] confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
939987 [45853] faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.
939987 [45854] 
939987 [45855] "Where are you off to?"
939987 [45856] 
939987 [45857] "I must go."
939987 [45858] 
939987 [45859] "You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don't go.
939987 [45860] What's the time? Is it twelve o'clock? What a pretty watch you have got,
939987 [45861] Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking."
939987 [45862] 
939987 [45863] "It was a present from Marfa Petrovna," answered Dounia.
939987 [45864] 
939987 [45865] "And a very expensive one!" added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [45866] 
939987 [45867] "A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady's."
939987 [45868] 
939987 [45869] "I like that sort," said Dounia.
939987 [45870] 
939987 [45871] "So it is not a present from her _fiancÃ©_," thought Razumihin, and was
939987 [45872] unreasonably delighted.
939987 [45873] 
939987 [45874] "I thought it was Luzhin's present," observed Raskolnikov.
939987 [45875] 
939987 [45876] "No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet."
939987 [45877] 
939987 [45878] "A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
939987 [45879] married?" he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted
939987 [45880] by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.
939987 [45881] 
939987 [45882] "Oh, yes, my dear."
939987 [45883] 
939987 [45884] Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.
939987 [45885] 
939987 [45886] "H'm, yes. What shall I tell you? I don't remember much indeed. She was
939987 [45887] such a sickly girl," he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.
939987 [45888] "Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was
939987 [45889] always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she
939987 [45890] began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very
939987 [45891] well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don't know what drew me
939987 [45892] to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been
939987 [45893] lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still," he
939987 [45894] smiled dreamily. "Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium."
939987 [45895] 
939987 [45896] "No, it was not only spring delirium," said Dounia, with warm feeling.
939987 [45897] 
939987 [45898] He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did
939987 [45899] not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,
939987 [45900] went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.
939987 [45901] 
939987 [45902] "You love her even now?" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.
939987 [45903] 
939987 [45904] "Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that's all now, as
939987 [45905] it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything
939987 [45906] happening here seems somehow far away." He looked attentively at them.
939987 [45907] "You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
939987 [45908] but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what's the use of
939987 [45909] asking about it?" he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell
939987 [45910] into dreamy silence again.
939987 [45911] 
939987 [45912] "What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It's like a tomb," said
939987 [45913] Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. "I
939987 [45914] am sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become so
939987 [45915] melancholy."
939987 [45916] 
939987 [45917] "My lodging," he answered, listlessly. "Yes, the lodging had a great
939987 [45918] deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,
939987 [45919] what a strange thing you said just now, mother," he said, laughing
939987 [45920] strangely.
939987 [45921] 
939987 [45922] A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,
939987 [45923] with him after three years' absence, this intimate tone of conversation,
939987 [45924] in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,
939987 [45925] would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent
939987 [45926] matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had
939987 [45927] decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of
939987 [45928] escape.
939987 [45929] 
939987 [45930] "Listen, Dounia," he began, gravely and drily, "of course I beg your
939987 [45931] pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that
939987 [45932] I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a
939987 [45933] scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease
939987 [45934] at once to look on you as a sister."
939987 [45935] 
939987 [45936] "Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again," Pulcheria
939987 [45937] Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. "And why do you call yourself a
939987 [45938] scoundrel? I can't bear it. You said the same yesterday."
939987 [45939] 
939987 [45940] "Brother," Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. "In all
939987 [45941] this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,
939987 [45942] and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am
939987 [45943] sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at
939987 [45944] all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for
939987 [45945] me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to
939987 [45946] my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision...."
939987 [45947] 
939987 [45948] "She is lying," he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.
939987 [45949] "Proud creature! She won't admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too
939987 [45950] haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,
939987 [45951] how I... hate them all!"
939987 [45952] 
939987 [45953] "In fact," continued Dounia, "I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of
939987 [45954] two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of
939987 [45955] me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?" She, too,
939987 [45956] flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
939987 [45957] 
939987 [45958] "All?" he asked, with a malignant grin.
939987 [45959] 
939987 [45960] "Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch's
939987 [45961] courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too
939987 [45962] well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing
939987 [45963] again?"
939987 [45964] 
939987 [45965] "And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are
939987 [45966] intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your
939987 [45967] own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked
939987 [45968] with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you
939987 [45969] are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it."
939987 [45970] 
939987 [45971] "It is not true. I am not lying," cried Dounia, losing her composure.
939987 [45972] "I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me
939987 [45973] and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly
939987 [45974] convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing
939987 [45975] proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as
939987 [45976] you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a
939987 [45977] vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
939987 [45978] Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It
939987 [45979] is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I
939987 [45980] am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you
939987 [45981] so pale? Rodya, darling, what's the matter?"
939987 [45982] 
939987 [45983] "Good heavens! You have made him faint," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [45984] 
939987 [45985] "No, no, nonsense! It's nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You
939987 [45986] have fainting on the brain. H'm, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In
939987 [45987] what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,
939987 [45988] and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?"
939987 [45989] 
939987 [45990] "Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch's letter," said Dounia.
939987 [45991] 
939987 [45992] With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He
939987 [45993] took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked
939987 [45994] with a sort of wonder at Dounia.
939987 [45995] 
939987 [45996] "It is strange," he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. "What
939987 [45997] am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!"
939987 [45998] 
939987 [45999] He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for
939987 [46000] some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at
939987 [46001] last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,
939987 [46002] slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.
939987 [46003] Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected
939987 [46004] something particular.
939987 [46005] 
939987 [46006] "What surprises me," he began, after a short pause, handing the letter
939987 [46007] to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, "is that he is a
939987 [46008] business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and
939987 [46009] yet he writes such an uneducated letter."
939987 [46010] 
939987 [46011] They all started. They had expected something quite different.
939987 [46012] 
939987 [46013] "But they all write like that, you know," Razumihin observed, abruptly.
939987 [46014] 
939987 [46015] "Have you read it?"
939987 [46016] 
939987 [46017] "Yes."
939987 [46018] 
939987 [46019] "We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now," Pulcheria
939987 [46020] Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
939987 [46021] 
939987 [46022] "That's just the jargon of the courts," Razumihin put in. "Legal
939987 [46023] documents are written like that to this day."
939987 [46024] 
939987 [46025] "Legal? Yes, it's just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,
939987 [46026] and not quite educated--business language!"
939987 [46027] 
939987 [46028] "Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
939987 [46029] education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way," Avdotya
939987 [46030] Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother's tone.
939987 [46031] 
939987 [46032] "Well, if he's proud of it, he has reason, I don't deny it. You seem to
939987 [46033] be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
939987 [46034] letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
939987 [46035] annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style
939987 [46036] occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There
939987 [46037] is one expression, 'blame yourselves' put in very significantly and
939987 [46038] plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I
939987 [46039] am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon
939987 [46040] you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning
939987 [46041] you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an
939987 [46042] expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
939987 [46043] written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?"
939987 [46044] 
939987 [46045] "N-no," answered Dounia, with more animation. "I saw clearly that it
939987 [46046] was too naÃ¯vely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill
939987 [46047] in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,
939987 [46048] indeed..."
939987 [46049] 
939987 [46050] "It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he
939987 [46051] intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression
939987 [46052] in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I
939987 [46053] gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed
939987 [46054] with trouble, and not 'on the pretext of the funeral,' but simply to pay
939987 [46055] for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,
939987 [46056] of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my
939987 [46057] life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander
939987 [46058] me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal
939987 [46059] jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and
939987 [46060] with a very naÃ¯ve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act
939987 [46061] sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I
939987 [46062] don't think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to
939987 [46063] warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good..."
939987 [46064] 
939987 [46065] Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only
939987 [46066] awaiting the evening.
939987 [46067] 
939987 [46068] "Then what is your decision, Rodya?" asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who
939987 [46069] was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his
939987 [46070] talk.
939987 [46071] 
939987 [46072] "What decision?"
939987 [46073] 
939987 [46074] "You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
939987 [46075] evening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?"
939987 [46076] 
939987 [46077] "That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are
939987 [46078] not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is
939987 [46079] not offended. I will do what you think best," he added, drily.
939987 [46080] 
939987 [46081] "Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her," Pulcheria
939987 [46082] Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
939987 [46083] 
939987 [46084] "I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at
939987 [46085] this interview," said Dounia. "Will you come?"
939987 [46086] 
939987 [46087] "Yes."
939987 [46088] 
939987 [46089] "I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock," she said,
939987 [46090] addressing Razumihin. "Mother, I am inviting him, too."
939987 [46091] 
939987 [46092] "Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided," added Pulcheria
939987 [46093] Alexandrovna, "so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like
939987 [46094] concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr
939987 [46095] Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!"
939987 [46096] 
939987 [46097] 
939987 [46098] 
939987 [46099] CHAPTER IV
939987 [46100] 
939987 [46101] At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into
939987 [46102] the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with
939987 [46103] surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise
939987 [46104] her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for
939987 [46105] the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such
939987 [46106] a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she
939987 [46107] was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,
939987 [46108] almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but
939987 [46109] somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor
939987 [46110] dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a
939987 [46111] parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so
939987 [46112] much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a
939987 [46113] little child. She was even about to retreat. "Oh... it's you!" said
939987 [46114] Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once
939987 [46115] recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin's letter
939987 [46116] of "some young woman of notorious behaviour." He had only just been
939987 [46117] protesting against Luzhin's calumny and declaring that he had seen the
939987 [46118] girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He
939987 [46119] remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression "of
939987 [46120] notorious behaviour." All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through
939987 [46121] his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated
939987 [46122] creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she
939987 [46123] made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
939987 [46124] 
939987 [46125] "I did not expect you," he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her
939987 [46126] stop. "Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [46127] Allow me--not there. Sit here...."
939987 [46128] 
939987 [46129] At Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of
939987 [46130] Raskolnikov's three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to
939987 [46131] enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
939987 [46132] Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him
939987 [46133] as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to
939987 [46134] Razumihin's chair.
939987 [46135] 
939987 [46136] "You sit here," he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.
939987 [46137] 
939987 [46138] Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the
939987 [46139] two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she
939987 [46140] could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened
939987 [46141] that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed
939987 [46142] Raskolnikov.
939987 [46143] 
939987 [46144] "I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you," she
939987 [46145] began falteringly. "I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to
939987 [46146] send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
939987 [46147] the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...
939987 [46148] to do her the honour... she told me to beg you..." Sonia stammered and
939987 [46149] ceased speaking.
939987 [46150] 
939987 [46151] "I will try, certainly, most certainly," answered Raskolnikov. He,
939987 [46152] too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.
939987 [46153] "Please sit down," he said, suddenly. "I want to talk to you. You are
939987 [46154] perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes," and
939987 [46155] he drew up a chair for her.
939987 [46156] 
939987 [46157] Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened
939987 [46158] look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov's pale face
939987 [46159] flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.
939987 [46160] 
939987 [46161] "Mother," he said, firmly and insistently, "this is Sofya Semyonovna
939987 [46162] Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run
939987 [46163] over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you."
939987 [46164] 
939987 [46165] Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up
939987 [46166] her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya's urgent and
939987 [46167] challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia
939987 [46168] gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinised
939987 [46169] her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise
939987 [46170] her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
939987 [46171] 
939987 [46172] "I wanted to ask you," said Raskolnikov, hastily, "how things were
939987 [46173] arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?"
939987 [46174] 
939987 [46175] "No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...
939987 [46176] they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry."
939987 [46177] 
939987 [46178] "Why?"
939987 [46179] 
939987 [46180] "At the body's remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,
939987 [46181] to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until
939987 [46182] to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees
939987 [46183] herself that it's necessary..."
939987 [46184] 
939987 [46185] "To-day, then?"
939987 [46186] 
939987 [46187] "She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the
939987 [46188] service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch."
939987 [46189] 
939987 [46190] "She is giving a funeral lunch?"
939987 [46191] 
939987 [46192] "Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping
939987 [46193] us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral."
939987 [46194] 
939987 [46195] All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she
939987 [46196] controlled herself, looking down again.
939987 [46197] 
939987 [46198] During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a
939987 [46199] thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a
939987 [46200] sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but
939987 [46201] her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such
939987 [46202] a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help
939987 [46203] being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another
939987 [46204] peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked
939987 [46205] almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this
939987 [46206] childishness seemed almost absurd.
939987 [46207] 
939987 [46208] "But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
939987 [46209] Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?" Raskolnikov asked,
939987 [46210] persistently keeping up the conversation.
939987 [46211] 
939987 [46212] "The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so
939987 [46213] it won't cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so
939987 [46214] that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious
939987 [46215] it should be so. You know one can't... it's a comfort to her... she is
939987 [46216] like that, you know...."
939987 [46217] 
939987 [46218] "I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room
939987 [46219] like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb."
939987 [46220] 
939987 [46221] "You gave us everything yesterday," Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a
939987 [46222] loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips
939987 [46223] and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once
939987 [46224] by Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words broke out
939987 [46225] spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia's eyes,
939987 [46226] and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.
939987 [46227] 
939987 [46228] "Rodya," she said, getting up, "we shall have dinner together, of
939987 [46229] course. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little
939987 [46230] walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am
939987 [46231] afraid we have exhausted you...."
939987 [46232] 
939987 [46233] "Yes, yes, I'll come," he answered, getting up fussily. "But I have
939987 [46234] something to see to."
939987 [46235] 
939987 [46236] "But surely you will have dinner together?" cried Razumihin, looking in
939987 [46237] surprise at Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"
939987 [46238] 
939987 [46239] "Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.
939987 [46240] You do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him
939987 [46241] from you?"
939987 [46242] 
939987 [46243] "Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining
939987 [46244] with us?"
939987 [46245] 
939987 [46246] "Please do," added Dounia.
939987 [46247] 
939987 [46248] Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all
939987 [46249] strangely embarrassed.
939987 [46250] 
939987 [46251] "Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.
939987 [46252] Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again."
939987 [46253] 
939987 [46254] Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed
939987 [46255] to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.
939987 [46256] 
939987 [46257] But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother
939987 [46258] out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave
939987 [46259] a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort
939987 [46260] in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy and attention were
939987 [46261] oppressive and painful to her.
939987 [46262] 
939987 [46263] "Dounia, good-bye," called Raskolnikov, in the passage. "Give me your
939987 [46264] hand."
939987 [46265] 
939987 [46266] "Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?" said Dounia, turning
939987 [46267] warmly and awkwardly to him.
939987 [46268] 
939987 [46269] "Never mind, give it to me again." And he squeezed her fingers warmly.
939987 [46270] 
939987 [46271] Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.
939987 [46272] 
939987 [46273] "Come, that's capital," he said to Sonia, going back and looking
939987 [46274] brightly at her. "God give peace to the dead, the living have still to
939987 [46275] live. That is right, isn't it?"
939987 [46276] 
939987 [46277] Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked
939987 [46278] at her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father
939987 [46279] floated before his memory in those moments....
939987 [46280] 
939987 [46281] *****
939987 [46282] 
939987 [46283] "Heavens, Dounia," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in
939987 [46284] the street, "I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.
939987 [46285] How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad
939987 [46286] of that."
939987 [46287] 
939987 [46288] "I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don't you see it?
939987 [46289] Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much
939987 [46290] can be forgiven."
939987 [46291] 
939987 [46292] "Well, you were not very patient!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,
939987 [46293] hotly and jealously. "Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You
939987 [46294] are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You
939987 [46295] are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both
939987 [46296] generous.... Surely he can't be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of
939987 [46297] what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!"
939987 [46298] 
939987 [46299] "Don't be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be."
939987 [46300] 
939987 [46301] "Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [46302] breaks it off?" poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.
939987 [46303] 
939987 [46304] "He won't be worth much if he does," answered Dounia, sharply and
939987 [46305] contemptuously.
939987 [46306] 
939987 [46307] "We did well to come away," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.
939987 [46308] "He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has
939987 [46309] a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is
939987 [46310] one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up
939987 [46311] rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will
939987 [46312] crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I
939987 [46313] declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,
939987 [46314] too."
939987 [46315] 
939987 [46316] "What young woman, mother?
939987 [46317] 
939987 [46318] "Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now."
939987 [46319] 
939987 [46320] "Why?"
939987 [46321] 
939987 [46322] "I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but
939987 [46323] as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief
939987 [46324] cause of the trouble...."
939987 [46325] 
939987 [46326] "Nothing of the sort!" cried Dounia, in vexation. "What nonsense, with
939987 [46327] your presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening
939987 [46328] before, and he did not know her when she came in."
939987 [46329] 
939987 [46330] "Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will
939987 [46331] see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could
939987 [46332] scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you
939987 [46333] remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that
939987 [46334] about her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great
939987 [46335] deal of her."
939987 [46336] 
939987 [46337] "People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,
939987 [46338] too. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it
939987 [46339] is all nonsense."
939987 [46340] 
939987 [46341] "God grant it may be!"
939987 [46342] 
939987 [46343] "And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer," Dounia snapped out,
939987 [46344] suddenly.
939987 [46345] 
939987 [46346] Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.
939987 [46347] 
939987 [46348] *****
939987 [46349] 
939987 [46350] "I will tell you what I want with you," said Raskolnikov, drawing
939987 [46351] Razumihin to the window.
939987 [46352] 
939987 [46353] "Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming," Sonia said
939987 [46354] hurriedly, preparing to depart.
939987 [46355] 
939987 [46356] "One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our
939987 [46357] way. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!" he turned
939987 [46358] suddenly to Razumihin again. "You know that... what's his name...
939987 [46359] Porfiry Petrovitch?"
939987 [46360] 
939987 [46361] "I should think so! He is a relation. Why?" added the latter, with
939987 [46362] interest.
939987 [46363] 
939987 [46364] "Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You
939987 [46365] were speaking about it yesterday."
939987 [46366] 
939987 [46367] "Yes... well?" Razumihin's eyes opened wide.
939987 [46368] 
939987 [46369] "He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some
939987 [46370] pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when
939987 [46371] I left home, and my father's silver watch--they are only worth five or
939987 [46372] six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I
939987 [46373] do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just
939987 [46374] now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia's
939987 [46375] watch. It is the only thing of father's left us. She would be ill if
939987 [46376] it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I
939987 [46377] ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be
939987 [46378] better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter
939987 [46379] might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before
939987 [46380] dinner."
939987 [46381] 
939987 [46382] "Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry," Razumihin
939987 [46383] shouted in extraordinary excitement. "Well, how glad I am. Let us go at
939987 [46384] once. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him."
939987 [46385] 
939987 [46386] "Very well, let us go."
939987 [46387] 
939987 [46388] "And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have
939987 [46389] often talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you
939987 [46390] yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that's it! It is all
939987 [46391] turning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna..."
939987 [46392] 
939987 [46393] "Sofya Semyonovna," corrected Raskolnikov. "Sofya Semyonovna, this is my
939987 [46394] friend Razumihin, and he is a good man."
939987 [46395] 
939987 [46396] "If you have to go now," Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin
939987 [46397] at all, and still more embarrassed.
939987 [46398] 
939987 [46399] "Let us go," decided Raskolnikov. "I will come to you to-day, Sofya
939987 [46400] Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live."
939987 [46401] 
939987 [46402] He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her
939987 [46403] eyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went
939987 [46404] out together.
939987 [46405] 
939987 [46406] "Don't you lock up?" asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.
939987 [46407] 
939987 [46408] "Never," answered Raskolnikov. "I have been meaning to buy a lock for
939987 [46409] these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks," he said,
939987 [46410] laughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.
939987 [46411] 
939987 [46412] "Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the
939987 [46413] way?" he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He
939987 [46414] wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.
939987 [46415] 
939987 [46416] "Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday."
939987 [46417] 
939987 [46418] "Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?
939987 [46419] Did I give her the address?"
939987 [46420] 
939987 [46421] "Why, had you forgotten?"
939987 [46422] 
939987 [46423] "No, I remember."
939987 [46424] 
939987 [46425] "I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,
939987 [46426] and he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,
939987 [46427] I asked to-day, 'Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?' I did not know you
939987 [46428] had only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna."
939987 [46429] 
939987 [46430] She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,
939987 [46431] hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty
939987 [46432] steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then
939987 [46433] moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to
939987 [46434] remember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she
939987 [46435] felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was
939987 [46436] opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to
939987 [46437] come to her that day, perhaps at once!
939987 [46438] 
939987 [46439] "Only not to-day, please, not to-day!" she kept muttering with a sinking
939987 [46440] heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. "Mercy! to
939987 [46441] me... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!"
939987 [46442] 
939987 [46443] She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who
939987 [46444] was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from
939987 [46445] the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood
939987 [46446] still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,
939987 [46447] started on hearing Sonia's words: "and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov
939987 [46448] lived?" He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially
939987 [46449] upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted
939987 [46450] the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not
939987 [46451] to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for
939987 [46452] something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and
939987 [46453] that Sonia was going home.
939987 [46454] 
939987 [46455] "Home? Where? I've seen that face somewhere," he thought. "I must find
939987 [46456] out."
939987 [46457] 
939987 [46458] At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the
939987 [46459] same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on
939987 [46460] the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook
939987 [46461] her and kept two or three yards behind her.
939987 [46462] 
939987 [46463] He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high
939987 [46464] shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore
939987 [46465] good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.
939987 [46466] He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each
939987 [46467] step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face
939987 [46468] with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.
939987 [46469] His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with
939987 [46470] grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.
939987 [46471] His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were
939987 [46472] crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger
939987 [46473] than his years.
939987 [46474] 
939987 [46475] When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on
939987 [46476] the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching
939987 [46477] the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed
939987 [46478] her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right
939987 [46479] corner. "Bah!" muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs
939987 [46480] behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,
939987 [46481] turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed
939987 [46482] in chalk, "Kapernaumov, Tailor." "Bah!" the stranger repeated again,
939987 [46483] wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.
939987 [46484] The doors were two or three yards apart.
939987 [46485] 
939987 [46486] "You lodge at Kapernaumov's," he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.
939987 [46487] "He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at
939987 [46488] Madame Resslich's. How odd!" Sonia looked at him attentively.
939987 [46489] 
939987 [46490] "We are neighbours," he went on gaily. "I only came to town the day
939987 [46491] before yesterday. Good-bye for the present."
939987 [46492] 
939987 [46493] Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for
939987 [46494] some reason ashamed and uneasy.
939987 [46495] 
939987 [46496] *****
939987 [46497] 
939987 [46498] On the way to Porfiry's, Razumihin was obviously excited.
939987 [46499] 
939987 [46500] "That's capital, brother," he repeated several times, "and I am glad! I
939987 [46501] am glad!"
939987 [46502] 
939987 [46503] "What are you glad about?" Raskolnikov thought to himself.
939987 [46504] 
939987 [46505] "I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too. And...
939987 [46506] was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?"
939987 [46507] 
939987 [46508] "What a simple-hearted fool he is!"
939987 [46509] 
939987 [46510] "When was it?" Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. "Two or three
939987 [46511] days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem
939987 [46512] the things now," he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous
939987 [46513] solicitude about the things. "I've not more than a silver rouble
939987 [46514] left... after last night's accursed delirium!"
939987 [46515] 
939987 [46516] He laid special emphasis on the delirium.
939987 [46517] 
939987 [46518] "Yes, yes," Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. "Then
939987 [46519] that's why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you
939987 [46520] were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that's
939987 [46521] clear, it's all clear now."
939987 [46522] 
939987 [46523] "Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will
939987 [46524] go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared
939987 [46525] up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have
939987 [46526] on all of them!"
939987 [46527] 
939987 [46528] "Shall we find him?" he asked suddenly.
939987 [46529] 
939987 [46530] "Oh, yes," Razumihin answered quickly. "He is a nice fellow, you will
939987 [46531] see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished
939987 [46532] manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent
939987 [46533] fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He
939987 [46534] is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or
939987 [46535] rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....
939987 [46536] But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a
939987 [46537] case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very
939987 [46538] anxious to make your acquaintance!"
939987 [46539] 
939987 [46540] "On what grounds is he so anxious?"
939987 [46541] 
939987 [46542] "Oh, it's not exactly... you see, since you've been ill I happen to have
939987 [46543] mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about
939987 [46544] your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,
939987 [46545] 'What a pity!' And so I concluded... from everything together, not only
939987 [46546] that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on
939987 [46547] the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,
939987 [46548] of your exaggerating it, you see."
939987 [46549] 
939987 [46550] "What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right," he said
939987 [46551] with a constrained smile.
939987 [46552] 
939987 [46553] "Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was
939987 [46554] something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense."
939987 [46555] 
939987 [46556] "But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!" Raskolnikov cried
939987 [46557] with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.
939987 [46558] 
939987 [46559] "I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One's ashamed
939987 [46560] to speak of it."
939987 [46561] 
939987 [46562] "If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it."
939987 [46563] 
939987 [46564] Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov
939987 [46565] perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had
939987 [46566] just said about Porfiry.
939987 [46567] 
939987 [46568] "I shall have to pull a long face with him too," he thought, with a
939987 [46569] beating heart, and he turned white, "and do it naturally, too. But the
939987 [46570] most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing
939987 [46571] at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we
939987 [46572] shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good
939987 [46573] thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is
939987 [46574] beating, that's what's bad!"
939987 [46575] 
939987 [46576] "In this grey house," said Razumihin.
939987 [46577] 
939987 [46578] "The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old
939987 [46579] hag's flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out
939987 [46580] instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I'll
939987 [46581] find out, if it's my ruin."
939987 [46582] 
939987 [46583] "I say, brother," he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly
939987 [46584] smile, "I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously
939987 [46585] excited. Isn't it so?"
939987 [46586] 
939987 [46587] "Excited? Not a bit of it," said Razumihin, stung to the quick.
939987 [46588] 
939987 [46589] "Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair
939987 [46590] in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be
939987 [46591] writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you
939987 [46592] were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even
939987 [46593] blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed
939987 [46594] awfully."
939987 [46595] 
939987 [46596] "Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?"
939987 [46597] 
939987 [46598] "But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there
939987 [46599] he's blushing again."
939987 [46600] 
939987 [46601] "What a pig you are!"
939987 [46602] 
939987 [46603] "But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I'll tell of you
939987 [46604] to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I'll make mother laugh, and someone else, too..."
939987 [46605] 
939987 [46606] "Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!"
939987 [46607] Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. "What will
939987 [46608] you tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!"
939987 [46609] 
939987 [46610] "You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a
939987 [46611] Romeo over six foot high! And how you've washed to-day--you cleaned your
939987 [46612] nails, I declare. Eh? That's something unheard of! Why, I do believe
939987 [46613] you've got pomatum on your hair! Bend down."
939987 [46614] 
939987 [46615] "Pig!"
939987 [46616] 
939987 [46617] Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So
939987 [46618] laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch's flat. This is what
939987 [46619] Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they
939987 [46620] came in, still guffawing in the passage.
939987 [46621] 
939987 [46622] "Not a word here or I'll... brain you!" Razumihin whispered furiously,
939987 [46623] seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.
939987 [46624] 
939987 [46625] 
939987 [46626] 
939987 [46627] CHAPTER V
939987 [46628] 
939987 [46629] Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though
939987 [46630] he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him
939987 [46631] Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,
939987 [46632] with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and
939987 [46633] whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified
939987 [46634] Raskolnikov's laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,
939987 [46635] bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room
939987 [46636] looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still
939987 [46637] apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few
939987 [46638] words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming
939987 [46639] a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as
939987 [46640] though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:
939987 [46641] his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried
939987 [46642] to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received
939987 [46643] this "spontaneous" mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most
939987 [46644] genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as
939987 [46645] though on purpose.
939987 [46646] 
939987 [46647] "Fool! You fiend," he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a
939987 [46648] little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent
939987 [46649] flying and crashing.
939987 [46650] 
939987 [46651] "But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it's a loss to the Crown,"
939987 [46652] Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.
939987 [46653] 
939987 [46654] Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch's,
939987 [46655] but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural
939987 [46656] end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table
939987 [46657] and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and
939987 [46658] turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back
939987 [46659] to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.
939987 [46660] Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but
939987 [46661] obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the
939987 [46662] corner, but he rose at the visitors' entrance and was standing in
939987 [46663] expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and
939987 [46664] even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a
939987 [46665] certain embarrassment. Zametov's unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov
939987 [46666] unpleasantly.
939987 [46667] 
939987 [46668] "I've got to think of that," he thought. "Excuse me, please," he began,
939987 [46669] affecting extreme embarrassment. "Raskolnikov."
939987 [46670] 
939987 [46671] "Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you've come
939987 [46672] in.... Why, won't he even say good-morning?" Porfiry Petrovitch nodded
939987 [46673] at Razumihin.
939987 [46674] 
939987 [46675] "Upon my honour I don't know why he is in such a rage with me. I only
939987 [46676] told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And
939987 [46677] that was all, I think!"
939987 [46678] 
939987 [46679] "Pig!" ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.
939987 [46680] 
939987 [46681] "There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at
939987 [46682] the word," Porfiry laughed.
939987 [46683] 
939987 [46684] "Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!" snapped Razumihin, and suddenly
939987 [46685] bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more
939987 [46686] cheerful face as though nothing had happened. "That'll do! We are
939987 [46687] all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch
939987 [46688] Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make
939987 [46689] your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with
939987 [46690] you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you
939987 [46691] known each other long?"
939987 [46692] 
939987 [46693] "What does this mean?" thought Raskolnikov uneasily.
939987 [46694] 
939987 [46695] Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
939987 [46696] 
939987 [46697] "Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday," he said easily.
939987 [46698] 
939987 [46699] "Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me
939987 [46700] to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out
939987 [46701] without me. Where is your tobacco?"
939987 [46702] 
939987 [46703] Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and
939987 [46704] trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,
939987 [46705] stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short
939987 [46706] and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His
939987 [46707] soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,
939987 [46708] but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been
939987 [46709] good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,
939987 [46710] mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression
939987 [46711] of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish
939987 [46712] figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at
939987 [46713] first sight.
939987 [46714] 
939987 [46715] As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter
939987 [46716] of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down
939987 [46717] himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with
939987 [46718] that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and
939987 [46719] embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are
939987 [46720] discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such
939987 [46721] exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov
939987 [46722] explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied
939987 [46723] with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.
939987 [46724] Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,
939987 [46725] sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,
939987 [46726] looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive
939987 [46727] interest.
939987 [46728] 
939987 [46729] "Fool," Raskolnikov swore to himself.
939987 [46730] 
939987 [46731] "You have to give information to the police," Porfiry replied, with a
939987 [46732] most businesslike air, "that having learnt of this incident, that is of
939987 [46733] the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such
939987 [46734] and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...
939987 [46735] or... but they will write to you."
939987 [46736] 
939987 [46737] "That's just the point, that at the present moment," Raskolnikov tried
939987 [46738] his utmost to feign embarrassment, "I am not quite in funds... and
939987 [46739] even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for
939987 [46740] the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have
939987 [46741] money...."
939987 [46742] 
939987 [46743] "That's no matter," answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his
939987 [46744] explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, "but you can, if you
939987 [46745] prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the
939987 [46746] matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg..."
939987 [46747] 
939987 [46748] "On an ordinary sheet of paper?" Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again
939987 [46749] interested in the financial side of the question.
939987 [46750] 
939987 [46751] "Oh, the most ordinary," and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with
939987 [46752] obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at
939987 [46753] him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for it all lasted but a
939987 [46754] moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could
939987 [46755] have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.
939987 [46756] 
939987 [46757] "He knows," flashed through his mind like lightning.
939987 [46758] 
939987 [46759] "Forgive my troubling you about such trifles," he went on, a little
939987 [46760] disconcerted, "the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them
939987 [46761] particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must
939987 [46762] confess that I was alarmed when I heard..."
939987 [46763] 
939987 [46764] "That's why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that
939987 [46765] Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!" Razumihin put in
939987 [46766] with obvious intention.
939987 [46767] 
939987 [46768] This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him
939987 [46769] with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately
939987 [46770] recollected himself.
939987 [46771] 
939987 [46772] "You seem to be jeering at me, brother?" he said to him, with a
939987 [46773] well-feigned irritability. "I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious
939987 [46774] about such trash; but you mustn't think me selfish or grasping for that,
939987 [46775] and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you
939987 [46776] just now that the silver watch, though it's not worth a cent, is the
939987 [46777] only thing left us of my father's. You may laugh at me, but my mother is
939987 [46778] here," he turned suddenly to Porfiry, "and if she knew," he turned again
939987 [46779] hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, "that the
939987 [46780] watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!"
939987 [46781] 
939987 [46782] "Not a bit of it! I didn't mean that at all! Quite the contrary!"
939987 [46783] shouted Razumihin distressed.
939987 [46784] 
939987 [46785] "Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?" Raskolnikov asked
939987 [46786] himself in a tremor. "Why did I say that about women?"
939987 [46787] 
939987 [46788] "Oh, your mother is with you?" Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.
939987 [46789] 
939987 [46790] "Yes."
939987 [46791] 
939987 [46792] "When did she come?"
939987 [46793] 
939987 [46794] "Last night."
939987 [46795] 
939987 [46796] Porfiry paused as though reflecting.
939987 [46797] 
939987 [46798] "Your things would not in any case be lost," he went on calmly and
939987 [46799] coldly. "I have been expecting you here for some time."
939987 [46800] 
939987 [46801] And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered
939987 [46802] the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash
939987 [46803] over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be
939987 [46804] looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin's cigarette.
939987 [46805] 
939987 [46806] "What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?"
939987 [46807] cried Razumihin.
939987 [46808] 
939987 [46809] Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.
939987 [46810] 
939987 [46811] "Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on
939987 [46812] the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the
939987 [46813] date on which you left them with her..."
939987 [46814] 
939987 [46815] "How observant you are!" Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very
939987 [46816] utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly
939987 [46817] added:
939987 [46818] 
939987 [46819] "I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it
939987 [46820] must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so
939987 [46821] clearly, and... and..."
939987 [46822] 
939987 [46823] "Stupid! Feeble!" he thought. "Why did I add that?"
939987 [46824] 
939987 [46825] "But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn't
939987 [46826] come forward," Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.
939987 [46827] 
939987 [46828] "I haven't been quite well."
939987 [46829] 
939987 [46830] "I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress
939987 [46831] about something. You look pale still."
939987 [46832] 
939987 [46833] "I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well," Raskolnikov snapped
939987 [46834] out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was
939987 [46835] mounting, he could not repress it. "And in my anger I shall betray
939987 [46836] myself," flashed through his mind again. "Why are they torturing me?"
939987 [46837] 
939987 [46838] "Not quite well!" Razumihin caught him up. "What next! He was
939987 [46839] unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as
939987 [46840] soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,
939987 [46841] and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,
939987 [46842] delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!"
939987 [46843] 
939987 [46844] "Really delirious? You don't say so!" Porfiry shook his head in a
939987 [46845] womanish way.
939987 [46846] 
939987 [46847] "Nonsense! Don't you believe it! But you don't believe it anyway,"
939987 [46848] Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem
939987 [46849] to catch those strange words.
939987 [46850] 
939987 [46851] "But how could you have gone out if you hadn't been delirious?"
939987 [46852] Razumihin got hot suddenly. "What did you go out for? What was the
939987 [46853] object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did
939987 [46854] it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly."
939987 [46855] 
939987 [46856] "I was awfully sick of them yesterday." Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry
939987 [46857] suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, "I ran away from them to
939987 [46858] take lodgings where they wouldn't find me, and took a lot of money with
939987 [46859] me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or
939987 [46860] delirious yesterday; settle our dispute."
939987 [46861] 
939987 [46862] He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his
939987 [46863] expression and his silence to him.
939987 [46864] 
939987 [46865] "In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were
939987 [46866] extremely irritable," Zametov pronounced dryly.
939987 [46867] 
939987 [46868] "And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day," put in Porfiry Petrovitch,
939987 [46869] "that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had
939987 [46870] been run over."
939987 [46871] 
939987 [46872] "And there," said Razumihin, "weren't you mad then? You gave your last
939987 [46873] penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen
939987 [46874] or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he
939987 [46875] flung away all the twenty-five at once!"
939987 [46876] 
939987 [46877] "Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So
939987 [46878] that's why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I've found a
939987 [46879] treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour
939987 [46880] with such trivialities," he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with
939987 [46881] trembling lips. "We are boring you, aren't we?"
939987 [46882] 
939987 [46883] "Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you
939987 [46884] interest me! It's interesting to look on and listen... and I am really
939987 [46885] glad you have come forward at last."
939987 [46886] 
939987 [46887] "But you might give us some tea! My throat's dry," cried Razumihin.
939987 [46888] 
939987 [46889] "Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn't you
939987 [46890] like... something more essential before tea?"
939987 [46891] 
939987 [46892] "Get along with you!"
939987 [46893] 
939987 [46894] Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.
939987 [46895] 
939987 [46896] Raskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.
939987 [46897] 
939987 [46898] "The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand on
939987 [46899] ceremony! And how if you didn't know me at all, did you come to talk
939987 [46900] to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don't care to hide that they are
939987 [46901] tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face." He was
939987 [46902] shaking with rage. "Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like a
939987 [46903] cat with a mouse. It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I
939987 [46904] won't allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly
939987 [46905] faces, and you'll see how I despise you." He could hardly breathe.
939987 [46906] "And what if it's only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through
939987 [46907] inexperience I get angry and don't keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it's
939987 [46908] all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is
939987 [46909] something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.
939987 [46910] Why did he say bluntly, 'With her'? Why did Zametov add that I spoke
939987 [46911] artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin
939987 [46912] is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never
939987 [46913] does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of
939987 [46914] course it's nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset
939987 [46915] my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it's ill fancy or they know!
939987 [46916] Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.
939987 [46917] I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it's my
939987 [46918] first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back
939987 [46919] to him. They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they
939987 [46920] were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If
939987 [46921] only they'd make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he
939987 [46922] let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use
939987 [46923] afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last
939987 [46924] night! He didn't know of my mother's arrival! The hag had written the
939987 [46925] date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won't catch me! There are no
939987 [46926] facts... it's all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn't a
939987 [46927] fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the
939987 [46928] flat? I won't go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being
939987 [46929] angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that's
939987 [46930] right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch
939987 [46931] me. Why did I come?"
939987 [46932] 
939987 [46933] All this flashed like lightning through his mind.
939987 [46934] 
939987 [46935] Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.
939987 [46936] 
939987 [46937] "Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out
939987 [46938] of sorts altogether," he began in quite a different tone, laughing to
939987 [46939] Razumihin.
939987 [46940] 
939987 [46941] "Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
939987 [46942] Who got the best of it?"
939987 [46943] 
939987 [46944] "Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated
939987 [46945] off into space."
939987 [46946] 
939987 [46947] "Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a
939987 [46948] thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off."
939987 [46949] 
939987 [46950] "What is there strange? It's an everyday social question," Raskolnikov
939987 [46951] answered casually.
939987 [46952] 
939987 [46953] "The question wasn't put quite like that," observed Porfiry.
939987 [46954] 
939987 [46955] "Not quite, that's true," Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and
939987 [46956] hurried as usual. "Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to
939987 [46957] hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to
939987 [46958] help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist
939987 [46959] doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the
939987 [46960] abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing
939987 [46961] more; no other causes admitted!..."
939987 [46962] 
939987 [46963] "You are wrong there," cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably
939987 [46964] animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him
939987 [46965] more excited than ever.
939987 [46966] 
939987 [46967] "Nothing is admitted," Razumihin interrupted with heat.
939987 [46968] 
939987 [46969] "I am not wrong. I'll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them
939987 [46970] is 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favourite
939987 [46971] phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,
939987 [46972] all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest
939987 [46973] against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature
939987 [46974] is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist!
939987 [46975] They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living
939987 [46976] process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a
939987 [46977] social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going
939987 [46978] to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an
939987 [46979] instant, quicker than any living process! That's why they instinctively
939987 [46980] dislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they
939987 [46981] explain it all as stupidity! That's why they so dislike the _living_
939987 [46982] process of life; they don't want a _living soul_! The living soul
939987 [46983] demands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an
939987 [46984] object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though
939987 [46985] it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not
939987 [46986] alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt! And it comes in the end
939987 [46987] to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning
939987 [46988] of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,
939987 [46989] indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it
939987 [46990] wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for the
939987 [46991] graveyard! You can't skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three
939987 [46992] possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce
939987 [46993] it all to the question of comfort! That's the easiest solution of the
939987 [46994] problem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it. That's
939987 [46995] the great thing, you mustn't think! The whole secret of life in two
939987 [46996] pages of print!"
939987 [46997] 
939987 [46998] "Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!" laughed
939987 [46999] Porfiry. "Can you imagine," he turned to Raskolnikov, "six people
939987 [47000] holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a
939987 [47001] preliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a
939987 [47002] great deal in crime; I can assure you of that."
939987 [47003] 
939987 [47004] "Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child
939987 [47005] of ten; was it environment drove him to it?"
939987 [47006] 
939987 [47007] "Well, strictly speaking, it did," Porfiry observed with noteworthy
939987 [47008] gravity; "a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the
939987 [47009] influence of environment."
939987 [47010] 
939987 [47011] Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. "Oh, if you like," he roared. "I'll
939987 [47012] prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the
939987 [47013] Church of Ivan the Great's being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I
939987 [47014] will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal
939987 [47015] tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?"
939987 [47016] 
939987 [47017] "Done! Let's hear, please, how he will prove it!"
939987 [47018] 
939987 [47019] "He is always humbugging, confound him," cried Razumihin, jumping up and
939987 [47020] gesticulating. "What's the use of talking to you? He does all that
939987 [47021] on purpose; you don't know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,
939987 [47022] simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they
939987 [47023] were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he
939987 [47024] persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two
939987 [47025] months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going
939987 [47026] to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered
939987 [47027] new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no
939987 [47028] bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!"
939987 [47029] 
939987 [47030] "Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in
939987 [47031] fact that made me think of taking you in."
939987 [47032] 
939987 [47033] "Are you such a good dissembler?" Raskolnikov asked carelessly.
939987 [47034] 
939987 [47035] "You wouldn't have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,
939987 [47036] too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I'll tell you the truth. All these questions about
939987 [47037] crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours
939987 [47038] which interested me at the time. 'On Crime'... or something of the
939987 [47039] sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the
939987 [47040] _Periodical Review_."
939987 [47041] 
939987 [47042] "My article? In the _Periodical Review_?" Raskolnikov asked in
939987 [47043] astonishment. "I certainly did write an article upon a book six months
939987 [47044] ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_."
939987 [47045] 
939987 [47046] "But it came out in the _Periodical_."
939987 [47047] 
939987 [47048] "And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn't
939987 [47049] printed at the time."
939987 [47050] 
939987 [47051] "That's true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was
939987 [47052] amalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two
939987 [47053] months ago in the latter. Didn't you know?"
939987 [47054] 
939987 [47055] Raskolnikov had not known.
939987 [47056] 
939987 [47057] "Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a
939987 [47058] strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know
939987 [47059] nothing of matters that concern you directly. It's a fact, I assure
939987 [47060] you."
939987 [47061] 
939987 [47062] "Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!" cried Razumihin. "I'll
939987 [47063] run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?
939987 [47064] What was the date? It doesn't matter though, I will find it. Think of
939987 [47065] not telling us!"
939987 [47066] 
939987 [47067] "How did you find out that the article was mine? It's only signed with
939987 [47068] an initial."
939987 [47069] 
939987 [47070] "I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know
939987 [47071] him.... I was very much interested."
939987 [47072] 
939987 [47073] "I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and
939987 [47074] after the crime."
939987 [47075] 
939987 [47076] "Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always
939987 [47077] accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part
939987 [47078] of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of
939987 [47079] the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working
939987 [47080] it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are
939987 [47081] certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have
939987 [47082] a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the
939987 [47083] law is not for them."
939987 [47084] 
939987 [47085] Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his
939987 [47086] idea.
939987 [47087] 
939987 [47088] "What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the
939987 [47089] influence of environment?" Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.
939987 [47090] 
939987 [47091] "No, not exactly because of it," answered Porfiry. "In his article all
939987 [47092] men are divided into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary.' Ordinary men have
939987 [47093] to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,
939987 [47094] don't you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to
939987 [47095] commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they
939987 [47096] are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?"
939987 [47097] 
939987 [47098] "What do you mean? That can't be right?" Razumihin muttered in
939987 [47099] bewilderment.
939987 [47100] 
939987 [47101] Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they
939987 [47102] wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.
939987 [47103] 
939987 [47104] "That wasn't quite my contention," he began simply and modestly. "Yet
939987 [47105] I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,
939987 [47106] perfectly so." (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) "The only
939987 [47107] difference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are always
939987 [47108] bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt
939987 [47109] whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an
939987 [47110] 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, but
939987 [47111] an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain
939987 [47112] obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment
939987 [47113] of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).
939987 [47114] You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear
939987 [47115] as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I
939987 [47116] maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have
939987 [47117] been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a
939987 [47118] hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have
939987 [47119] been in duty bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for
939987 [47120] the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But
939987 [47121] it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people
939987 [47122] right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I
939987 [47123] maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,
939987 [47124] such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without
939987 [47125] exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they
939987 [47126] transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held
939987 [47127] sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,
939987 [47128] if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence
939987 [47129] of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It's remarkable, in fact,
939987 [47130] that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity
939987 [47131] were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men
939987 [47132] or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving
939987 [47133] some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,
939987 [47134] of course. Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut;
939987 [47135] and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their
939987 [47136] very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to
939987 [47137] it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The
939987 [47138] same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my
939987 [47139] division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that
939987 [47140] it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. I only
939987 [47141] believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law
939987 [47142] of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,
939987 [47143] material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have
939987 [47144] the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,
939987 [47145] innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both
939987 [47146] categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally
939987 [47147] speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live
939987 [47148] under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty
939987 [47149] to be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothing
939987 [47150] humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the
939987 [47151] law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their
939987 [47152] capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;
939987 [47153] for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the
939987 [47154] present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the
939987 [47155] sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I
939987 [47156] maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading
939987 [47157] through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.
939987 [47158] It's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article
939987 [47159] (you remember it began with the legal question). There's no need for
939987 [47160] such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,
939987 [47161] they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil
939987 [47162] quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these
939987 [47163] criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or
939987 [47164] less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second
939987 [47165] the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the
939987 [47166] second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal
939987 [47167] right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la
939987 [47168] guerre Ã©ternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!"
939987 [47169] 
939987 [47170] "Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?"
939987 [47171] 
939987 [47172] "I do," Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during
939987 [47173] the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.
939987 [47174] 
939987 [47175] "And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity."
939987 [47176] 
939987 [47177] "I do," repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.
939987 [47178] 
939987 [47179] "And... do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?"
939987 [47180] 
939987 [47181] "I... I do. Why do you ask all this?"
939987 [47182] 
939987 [47183] "You believe it literally?"
939987 [47184] 
939987 [47185] "Literally."
939987 [47186] 
939987 [47187] "You don't say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us
939987 [47188] go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the
939987 [47189] contrary..."
939987 [47190] 
939987 [47191] "Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this
939987 [47192] life, and then..."
939987 [47193] 
939987 [47194] "They begin executing other people?"
939987 [47195] 
939987 [47196] "If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is
939987 [47197] very witty."
939987 [47198] 
939987 [47199] "Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary
939987 [47200] people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel
939987 [47201] there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the
939987 [47202] natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't they
939987 [47203] adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn't they wear something, be
939987 [47204] branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of
939987 [47205] one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to 'eliminate
939987 [47206] obstacles' as you so happily expressed it, then..."
939987 [47207] 
939987 [47208] "Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other."
939987 [47209] 
939987 [47210] "Thank you."
939987 [47211] 
939987 [47212] "No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in
939987 [47213] the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps
939987 [47214] unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to
939987 [47215] obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes
939987 [47216] vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,
939987 [47217] 'destroyers,' and to push themselves into the 'new movement,' and
939987 [47218] this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often
939987 [47219] unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling
939987 [47220] tendencies. But I don't think there is any considerable danger here,
939987 [47221] and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,
939987 [47222] they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away
939987 [47223] with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even
939987 [47224] this isn't necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very
939987 [47225] conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others
939987 [47226] chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various
939987 [47227] public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying
939987 [47228] effect; in fact you've nothing to be uneasy about.... It's a law of
939987 [47229] nature."
939987 [47230] 
939987 [47231] "Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but
939987 [47232] there's another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people
939987 [47233] who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am
939987 [47234] ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarming
939987 [47235] if there are a great many of them, eh?"
939987 [47236] 
939987 [47237] "Oh, you needn't worry about that either," Raskolnikov went on in the
939987 [47238] same tone. "People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for
939987 [47239] saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily
939987 [47240] so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these
939987 [47241] grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity
939987 [47242] some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am
939987 [47243] convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of
939987 [47244] mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,
939987 [47245] by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and
939987 [47246] stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a
939987 [47247] thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I
939987 [47248] speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with
939987 [47249] still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius
939987 [47250] is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,
939987 [47251] appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have
939987 [47252] not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there
939987 [47253] certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of
939987 [47254] chance."
939987 [47255] 
939987 [47256] "Why, are you both joking?" Razumihin cried at last. "There you sit,
939987 [47257] making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?"
939987 [47258] 
939987 [47259] Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.
939987 [47260] And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of
939987 [47261] Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
939987 [47262] 
939987 [47263] "Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,
939987 [47264] in saying that it's not new, that it's like what we've read and heard a
939987 [47265] thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is
939987 [47266] exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed
939987 [47267] _in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such
939987 [47268] fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that
939987 [47269] sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible
939987 [47270] than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed...."
939987 [47271] 
939987 [47272] "You are quite right, it is more terrible," Porfiry agreed.
939987 [47273] 
939987 [47274] "Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.
939987 [47275] You can't think that! I shall read it."
939987 [47276] 
939987 [47277] "All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of it," said
939987 [47278] Raskolnikov.
939987 [47279] 
939987 [47280] "Yes, yes." Porfiry couldn't sit still. "Your attitude to crime is
939987 [47281] pretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am
939987 [47282] really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you've removed
939987 [47283] my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various
939987 [47284] practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth
939987 [47285] imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and
939987 [47286] suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great
939987 [47287] enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...
939987 [47288] do you see?"
939987 [47289] 
939987 [47290] Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even
939987 [47291] raise his eyes to him.
939987 [47292] 
939987 [47293] "I must admit," he went on calmly, "that such cases certainly must
939987 [47294] arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that
939987 [47295] snare; young people especially."
939987 [47296] 
939987 [47297] "Yes, you see. Well then?"
939987 [47298] 
939987 [47299] "What then?" Raskolnikov smiled in reply; "that's not my fault. So it is
939987 [47300] and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)
939987 [47301] that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,
939987 [47302] banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There's no need to
939987 [47303] be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief."
939987 [47304] 
939987 [47305] "And what if we do catch him?"
939987 [47306] 
939987 [47307] "Then he gets what he deserves."
939987 [47308] 
939987 [47309] "You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?"
939987 [47310] 
939987 [47311] "Why do you care about that?"
939987 [47312] 
939987 [47313] "Simply from humanity."
939987 [47314] 
939987 [47315] "If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his
939987 [47316] punishment--as well as the prison."
939987 [47317] 
939987 [47318] "But the real geniuses," asked Razumihin frowning, "those who have
939987 [47319] the right to murder? Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood
939987 [47320] they've shed?"
939987 [47321] 
939987 [47322] "Why the word _ought_? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition.
939987 [47323] He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are
939987 [47324] always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The
939987 [47325] really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth," he added
939987 [47326] dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.
939987 [47327] 
939987 [47328] He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his
939987 [47329] cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and
939987 [47330] he felt this. Everyone got up.
939987 [47331] 
939987 [47332] "Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like," Porfiry
939987 [47333] Petrovitch began again, "but I can't resist. Allow me one little
939987 [47334] question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I
939987 [47335] want to express, simply that I may not forget it."
939987 [47336] 
939987 [47337] "Very good, tell me your little notion," Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale
939987 [47338] and grave before him.
939987 [47339] 
939987 [47340] "Well, you see... I really don't know how to express it properly....
939987 [47341] It's a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your
939987 [47342] article, surely you couldn't have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...
939987 [47343] just a little, an 'extraordinary' man, uttering a _new word_ in your
939987 [47344] sense.... That's so, isn't it?"
939987 [47345] 
939987 [47346] "Quite possibly," Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.
939987 [47347] 
939987 [47348] Razumihin made a movement.
939987 [47349] 
939987 [47350] "And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties
939987 [47351] and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...
939987 [47352] For instance, to rob and murder?"
939987 [47353] 
939987 [47354] And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as
939987 [47355] before.
939987 [47356] 
939987 [47357] "If I did I certainly should not tell you," Raskolnikov answered with
939987 [47358] defiant and haughty contempt.
939987 [47359] 
939987 [47360] "No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary
939987 [47361] point of view..."
939987 [47362] 
939987 [47363] "Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!" Raskolnikov thought with
939987 [47364] repulsion.
939987 [47365] 
939987 [47366] "Allow me to observe," he answered dryly, "that I don't consider myself
939987 [47367] a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being
939987 [47368] one of them I cannot tell you how I should act."
939987 [47369] 
939987 [47370] "Oh, come, don't we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?"
939987 [47371] Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
939987 [47372] 
939987 [47373] Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.
939987 [47374] 
939987 [47375] "Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona
939987 [47376] Ivanovna last week?" Zametov blurted out from the corner.
939987 [47377] 
939987 [47378] Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.
939987 [47379] Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing
939987 [47380] something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy
939987 [47381] silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.
939987 [47382] 
939987 [47383] "Are you going already?" Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with
939987 [47384] excessive politeness. "Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your
939987 [47385] request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,
939987 [47386] come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall
939987 [47387] be there at eleven o'clock for certain. We'll arrange it all; we'll have
939987 [47388] a talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to
939987 [47389] tell us something," he added with a most good-natured expression.
939987 [47390] 
939987 [47391] "You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?" Raskolnikov asked
939987 [47392] sharply.
939987 [47393] 
939987 [47394] "Oh, why? That's not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.
939987 [47395] I lose no opportunity, you see, and... I've talked with all who had
939987 [47396] pledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the
939987 [47397] last.... Yes, by the way," he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, "I
939987 [47398] just remember, what was I thinking of?" he turned to Razumihin, "you
939987 [47399] were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know
939987 [47400] very well," he turned to Raskolnikov, "that the fellow is innocent, but
939987 [47401] what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,
939987 [47402] this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn't it?"
939987 [47403] 
939987 [47404] "Yes," answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very
939987 [47405] moment he spoke that he need not have said it.
939987 [47406] 
939987 [47407] "Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn't you see in
939987 [47408] a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen
939987 [47409] or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn't you notice
939987 [47410] them? It's very, very important for them."
939987 [47411] 
939987 [47412] "Painters? No, I didn't see them," Raskolnikov answered slowly, as
939987 [47413] though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking
939987 [47414] every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as
939987 [47415] possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. "No, I didn't
939987 [47416] see them, and I don't think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on
939987 [47417] the fourth storey" (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)
939987 [47418] "I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona
939987 [47419] Ivanovna's.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters
939987 [47420] were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But
939987 [47421] painters... no, I don't remember that there were any painters, and I
939987 [47422] don't think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn't."
939987 [47423] 
939987 [47424] "What do you mean?" Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had
939987 [47425] reflected and realised. "Why, it was on the day of the murder the
939987 [47426] painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you
939987 [47427] asking?"
939987 [47428] 
939987 [47429] "Foo! I have muddled it!" Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.
939987 [47430] "Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!" he addressed
939987 [47431] Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. "It would be such a great thing for
939987 [47432] us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at
939987 [47433] the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I
939987 [47434] quite muddled it."
939987 [47435] 
939987 [47436] "Then you should be more careful," Razumihin observed grimly.
939987 [47437] 
939987 [47438] The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them
939987 [47439] to the door with excessive politeness.
939987 [47440] 
939987 [47441] They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they
939987 [47442] did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.
939987 [47443] 
939987 [47444] 
939987 [47445] 
939987 [47446] CHAPTER VI
939987 [47447] 
939987 [47448] "I don't believe it, I can't believe it!" repeated Razumihin, trying in
939987 [47449] perplexity to refute Raskolnikov's arguments.
939987 [47450] 
939987 [47451] They were by now approaching Bakaleyev's lodgings, where Pulcheria
939987 [47452] Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin
939987 [47453] kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited
939987 [47454] by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about
939987 [47455] _it_.
939987 [47456] 
939987 [47457] "Don't believe it, then!" answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless
939987 [47458] smile. "You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every
939987 [47459] word."
939987 [47460] 
939987 [47461] "You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h'm...
939987 [47462] certainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather strange, and still
939987 [47463] more that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about
939987 [47464] him--but why? Why?"
939987 [47465] 
939987 [47466] "He has changed his mind since last night."
939987 [47467] 
939987 [47468] "Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do
939987 [47469] their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you
939987 [47470] afterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless."
939987 [47471] 
939987 [47472] "If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for
939987 [47473] suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,
939987 [47474] in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago
939987 [47475] besides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all
939987 [47476] ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by
939987 [47477] impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted
939987 [47478] it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
939987 [47479] intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to
939987 [47480] know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome
939987 [47481] explaining it all. Stop!"
939987 [47482] 
939987 [47483] "And it's insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have
939987 [47484] spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I
939987 [47485] am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,
939987 [47486] this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an
939987 [47487] insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you
939987 [47488] knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,
939987 [47489] unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious
939987 [47490] illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to
939987 [47491] speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to
939987 [47492] face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and
939987 [47493] the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented
939987 [47494] by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling
939987 [47495] atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person
939987 [47496] where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he
939987 [47497] might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it
939987 [47498] all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,
939987 [47499] Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,
939987 [47500] and spit a dozen times in all directions. I'd hit out in all
939987 [47501] directions, neatly too, and so I'd put an end to it. Damn them! Don't be
939987 [47502] downhearted. It's a shame!"
939987 [47503] 
939987 [47504] "He really has put it well, though," Raskolnikov thought.
939987 [47505] 
939987 [47506] "Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?" he said with
939987 [47507] bitterness. "Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel
939987 [47508] vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the
939987 [47509] restaurant...."
939987 [47510] 
939987 [47511] "Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as
939987 [47512] one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And
939987 [47513] as for Zametov..."
939987 [47514] 
939987 [47515] "At last he sees through him!" thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [47516] 
939987 [47517] "Stay!" cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. "Stay! you
939987 [47518] were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?
939987 [47519] You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had
939987 [47520] done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...
939987 [47521] and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if
939987 [47522] you had seen it. Who would own it against himself?"
939987 [47523] 
939987 [47524] "If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had
939987 [47525] seen the workmen and the flat," Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance
939987 [47526] and obvious disgust.
939987 [47527] 
939987 [47528] "But why speak against yourself?"
939987 [47529] 
939987 [47530] "Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny
939987 [47531] everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed
939987 [47532] and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts
939987 [47533] that can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will
939987 [47534] introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another
939987 [47535] significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon
939987 [47536] that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an
939987 [47537] air of truth, and then make some explanation."
939987 [47538] 
939987 [47539] "But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been
939987 [47540] there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on
939987 [47541] the day of the murder at eight o'clock. And so he would have caught you
939987 [47542] over a detail."
939987 [47543] 
939987 [47544] "Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to
939987 [47545] reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and
939987 [47546] so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days
939987 [47547] before."
939987 [47548] 
939987 [47549] "But how could you forget it?"
939987 [47550] 
939987 [47551] "Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most
939987 [47552] easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he
939987 [47553] will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler
939987 [47554] the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you
939987 [47555] think...."
939987 [47556] 
939987 [47557] "He is a knave then, if that is so!"
939987 [47558] 
939987 [47559] Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was
939987 [47560] struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness
939987 [47561] with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the
939987 [47562] preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,
939987 [47563] from necessity.
939987 [47564] 
939987 [47565] "I am getting a relish for certain aspects!" he thought to himself.
939987 [47566] But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an
939987 [47567] unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on
939987 [47568] increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's.
939987 [47569] 
939987 [47570] "Go in alone!" said Raskolnikov suddenly. "I will be back directly."
939987 [47571] 
939987 [47572] "Where are you going? Why, we are just here."
939987 [47573] 
939987 [47574] "I can't help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them."
939987 [47575] 
939987 [47576] "Say what you like, I will come with you."
939987 [47577] 
939987 [47578] "You, too, want to torture me!" he screamed, with such bitter
939987 [47579] irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin's hands dropped.
939987 [47580] He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov
939987 [47581] striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting
939987 [47582] his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry
939987 [47583] like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria
939987 [47584] Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.
939987 [47585] 
939987 [47586] When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was
939987 [47587] breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his
939987 [47588] unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror
939987 [47589] he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put
939987 [47590] the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the
939987 [47591] hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up
939987 [47592] and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, he
939987 [47593] suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper
939987 [47594] in which they had been wrapped with the old woman's handwriting on it,
939987 [47595] might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then
939987 [47596] might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.
939987 [47597] 
939987 [47598] He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half
939987 [47599] senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went
939987 [47600] quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily
939987 [47601] through the gateway.
939987 [47602] 
939987 [47603] "Here he is himself," shouted a loud voice.
939987 [47604] 
939987 [47605] He raised his head.
939987 [47606] 
939987 [47607] The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing
939987 [47608] him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat
939987 [47609] and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He
939987 [47610] stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled
939987 [47611] flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and
939987 [47612] they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
939987 [47613] 
939987 [47614] "What is it?" Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.
939987 [47615] 
939987 [47616] The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him
939987 [47617] attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the
939987 [47618] gate into the street without saying a word.
939987 [47619] 
939987 [47620] "What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.
939987 [47621] 
939987 [47622] "Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your
939987 [47623] name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and
939987 [47624] he went away. It's funny."
939987 [47625] 
939987 [47626] The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after
939987 [47627] wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.
939987 [47628] 
939987 [47629] Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of
939987 [47630] him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,
939987 [47631] deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in
939987 [47632] meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.
939987 [47633] At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man
939987 [47634] noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;
939987 [47635] and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.
939987 [47636] 
939987 [47637] "You were inquiring for me... of the porter?" Raskolnikov said at last,
939987 [47638] but in a curiously quiet voice.
939987 [47639] 
939987 [47640] The man made no answer; he didn't even look at him. Again they were both
939987 [47641] silent.
939987 [47642] 
939987 [47643] "Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What's the
939987 [47644] meaning of it?"
939987 [47645] 
939987 [47646] Raskolnikov's voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words
939987 [47647] clearly.
939987 [47648] 
939987 [47649] The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at
939987 [47650] Raskolnikov.
939987 [47651] 
939987 [47652] "Murderer!" he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.
939987 [47653] 
939987 [47654] Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a
939987 [47655] cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for
939987 [47656] a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So
939987 [47657] they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
939987 [47658] 
939987 [47659] The man did not look at him.
939987 [47660] 
939987 [47661] "What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?" muttered
939987 [47662] Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
939987 [47663] 
939987 [47664] "_You_ are a murderer," the man answered still more articulately and
939987 [47665] emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked
939987 [47666] straight into Raskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes.
939987 [47667] 
939987 [47668] They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left
939987 [47669] without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after
939987 [47670] him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still
939987 [47671] standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that
939987 [47672] he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.
939987 [47673] 
939987 [47674] With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way
939987 [47675] back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap
939987 [47676] and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
939987 [47677] Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
939987 [47678] stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.
939987 [47679] 
939987 [47680] He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some
939987 [47681] images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of
939987 [47682] people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would
939987 [47683] never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table
939987 [47684] in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars
939987 [47685] in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite
939987 [47686] dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the
939987 [47687] Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one
939987 [47688] another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried
939987 [47689] to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression
939987 [47690] within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even
939987 [47691] pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too
939987 [47692] was an almost pleasant sensation.
939987 [47693] 
939987 [47694] He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and
939987 [47695] pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some
939987 [47696] time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into
939987 [47697] the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya's
939987 [47698] whisper:
939987 [47699] 
939987 [47700] "Don't disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later."
939987 [47701] 
939987 [47702] "Quite so," answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the
939987 [47703] door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on
939987 [47704] his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.
939987 [47705] 
939987 [47706] "Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,
939987 [47707] what did he see? He has seen it all, that's clear. Where was he then?
939987 [47708] And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?
939987 [47709] And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm..." continued Raskolnikov,
939987 [47710] turning cold and shivering, "and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the
939987 [47711] door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you
939987 [47712] can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it
939987 [47713] possible?" He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he
939987 [47714] had become. "I ought to have known it," he thought with a bitter smile.
939987 [47715] "And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an
939987 [47716] axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did
939987 [47717] know!" he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some
939987 [47718] thought.
939987 [47719] 
939987 [47720] "No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is
939987 [47721] permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in
939987 [47722] Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off
939987 [47723] with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and
939987 [47724] so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but
939987 [47725] of bronze!"
939987 [47726] 
939987 [47727] One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the
939987 [47728] pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with
939987 [47729] a red trunk under her bed--it's a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to
939987 [47730] digest! How can they digest it! It's too inartistic. "A Napoleon creep
939987 [47731] under an old woman's bed! Ugh, how loathsome!"
939987 [47732] 
939987 [47733] At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish
939987 [47734] excitement. "The old woman is of no consequence," he thought, hotly and
939987 [47735] incoherently. "The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not
939987 [47736] what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to
939987 [47737] overstep.... I didn't kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the
939987 [47738] principle, but I didn't overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was
939987 [47739] only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn't even capable of that...
939987 [47740] Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are
939987 [47741] industrious, commercial people; 'the happiness of all' is their case.
939987 [47742] No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I
939987 [47743] don't want to wait for 'the happiness of all.' I want to live myself,
939987 [47744] or else better not live at all. I simply couldn't pass by my mother
939987 [47745] starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the
939987 [47746] 'happiness of all.' I am putting my little brick into the happiness of
939987 [47747] all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only
939987 [47748] live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an Ã¦sthetic louse and nothing
939987 [47749] more," he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. "Yes, I am certainly a
939987 [47750] louse," he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing
939987 [47751] with it with vindictive pleasure. "In the first place, because I can
939987 [47752] reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been
939987 [47753] troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for
939987 [47754] my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble
939987 [47755] object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as
939987 [47756] possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked
939987 [47757] out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I
939987 [47758] needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone
939987 [47759] to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I
939987 [47760] am utterly a louse," he added, grinding his teeth, "is that I am
939987 [47761] perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt
939987 [47762] beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can
939987 [47763] anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The
939987 [47764] abjectness! I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed:
939987 [47765] Allah commands and 'trembling' creation must obey! The 'prophet' is
939987 [47766] right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up
939987 [47767] the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It's for you to
939987 [47768] obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that's not for
939987 [47769] you!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!"
939987 [47770] 
939987 [47771] His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his
939987 [47772] eyes were fixed on the ceiling.
939987 [47773] 
939987 [47774] "Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate
939987 [47775] them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....
939987 [47776] I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her
939987 [47777] and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That's just what
939987 [47778] I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am," he added, straining
939987 [47779] himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. "Ah, how I hate
939987 [47780] the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!
939987 [47781] Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It's strange though, why is it
939987 [47782] I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn't killed her? Lizaveta!
939987 [47783] Sonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don't
939987 [47784] they weep? Why don't they moan? They give up everything... their eyes
939987 [47785] are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!"
939987 [47786] 
939987 [47787] He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn't remember
939987 [47788] how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen
939987 [47789] and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a
939987 [47790] peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the
939987 [47791] street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other
939987 [47792] people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and
939987 [47793] stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was
939987 [47794] distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do
939987 [47795] something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he
939987 [47796] stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,
939987 [47797] beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and
939987 [47798] walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to
939987 [47799] him. "Stay, did he really beckon?" Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried
939987 [47800] to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and
939987 [47801] was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long
939987 [47802] coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;
939987 [47803] they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. "Does he
939987 [47804] know I am following him?" thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the
939987 [47805] gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in
939987 [47806] to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard
939987 [47807] the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at
939987 [47808] once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have
939987 [47809] gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard
939987 [47810] slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely
939987 [47811] familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone
939987 [47812] through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he
939987 [47813] reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were
939987 [47814] at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps
939987 [47815] of the man above had died away. "So he must have stopped or hidden
939987 [47816] somewhere." He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a
939987 [47817] stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own
939987 [47818] footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be
939987 [47819] hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he
939987 [47820] hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as
939987 [47821] though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour
939987 [47822] which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the
939987 [47823] chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the
939987 [47824] frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
939987 [47825] "It's the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery," thought
939987 [47826] Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more
939987 [47827] silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was
939987 [47828] painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp
939987 [47829] crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly
939987 [47830] flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At
939987 [47831] that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little
939987 [47832] cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. "Why is that cloak
939987 [47833] here?" he thought, "it wasn't there before...." He went up to it quietly
939987 [47834] and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved
939987 [47835] the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent
939987 [47836] double so that he couldn't see her face; but it was she. He stood over
939987 [47837] her. "She is afraid," he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the
939987 [47838] noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange
939987 [47839] to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was
939987 [47840] frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,
939987 [47841] bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up
939987 [47842] into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old
939987 [47843] woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing
939987 [47844] her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door
939987 [47845] from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and
939987 [47846] whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the
939987 [47847] old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe
939987 [47848] the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old
939987 [47849] woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the
939987 [47850] passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the
939987 [47851] landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of
939987 [47852] heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.
939987 [47853] Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they
939987 [47854] would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.
939987 [47855] 
939987 [47856] He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:
939987 [47857] his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the
939987 [47858] doorway watching him intently.
939987 [47859] 
939987 [47860] Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them
939987 [47861] again. He lay on his back without stirring.
939987 [47862] 
939987 [47863] "Is it still a dream?" he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly
939987 [47864] perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching
939987 [47865] him.
939987 [47866] 
939987 [47867] He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after
939987 [47868] him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on
939987 [47869] Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he
939987 [47870] put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane
939987 [47871] and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait
939987 [47872] indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen
939987 [47873] glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost
939987 [47874] whitish beard.
939987 [47875] 
939987 [47876] Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There
939987 [47877] was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.
939987 [47878] Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was
939987 [47879] unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
939987 [47880] 
939987 [47881] "Come, tell me what you want."
939987 [47882] 
939987 [47883] "I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending," the stranger answered
939987 [47884] oddly, laughing calmly. "Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov, allow me to
939987 [47885] introduce myself...."
939987 [47886] 
939987 [47887] 
939987 [47888] 
939987 [47889] 
939987 [47890] PART IV
939987 [47891] 
939987 [47892] 
939987 [47893] 
939987 [47894] CHAPTER I
939987 [47895] 
939987 [47896] "Can this be still a dream?" Raskolnikov thought once more.
939987 [47897] 
939987 [47898] He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.
939987 [47899] 
939987 [47900] "SvidrigaÃ¯lov! What nonsense! It can't be!" he said at last aloud in
939987 [47901] bewilderment.
939987 [47902] 
939987 [47903] His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.
939987 [47904] 
939987 [47905] "I've come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make
939987 [47906] your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about
939987 [47907] you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope
939987 [47908] that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the
939987 [47909] welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she
939987 [47910] might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,
939987 [47911] but with your assistance I reckon on..."
939987 [47912] 
939987 [47913] "You reckon wrongly," interrupted Raskolnikov.
939987 [47914] 
939987 [47915] "They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?"
939987 [47916] 
939987 [47917] Raskolnikov made no reply.
939987 [47918] 
939987 [47919] "It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,
939987 [47920] let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don't consider it necessary
939987 [47921] to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly
939987 [47922] criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,
939987 [47923] with common sense?"
939987 [47924] 
939987 [47925] Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
939987 [47926] 
939987 [47927] "That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 'insulted her
939987 [47928] with my infamous proposals'--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But
939987 [47929] you've only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a
939987 [47930] word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which
939987 [47931] does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the
939987 [47932] most natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself
939987 [47933] a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my
939987 [47934] passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished
939987 [47935] the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting
939987 [47936] our mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,
939987 [47937] probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!"
939987 [47938] 
939987 [47939] "But that's not the point," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. "It's
939987 [47940] simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don't
939987 [47941] want to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!"
939987 [47942] 
939987 [47943] SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a sudden laugh.
939987 [47944] 
939987 [47945] "But you're... but there's no getting round you," he said, laughing in
939987 [47946] the frankest way. "I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right
939987 [47947] line at once!"
939987 [47948] 
939987 [47949] "But you are trying to get round me still!"
939987 [47950] 
939987 [47951] "What of it? What of it?" cried SvidrigaÃ¯lov, laughing openly. "But this
939987 [47952] is what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of
939987 [47953] deception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I
939987 [47954] repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for
939987 [47955] what happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna..."
939987 [47956] 
939987 [47957] "You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?" Raskolnikov
939987 [47958] interrupted rudely.
939987 [47959] 
939987 [47960] "Oh, you've heard that, too, then? You'd be sure to, though.... But
939987 [47961] as for your question, I really don't know what to say, though my own
939987 [47962] conscience is quite at rest on that score. Don't suppose that I am in
939987 [47963] any apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical
939987 [47964] inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy
939987 [47965] dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing
939987 [47966] else. But I'll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on
939987 [47967] my way here in the train, especially: didn't I contribute to all that...
939987 [47968] calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the
939987 [47969] sort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the
939987 [47970] question."
939987 [47971] 
939987 [47972] Raskolnikov laughed.
939987 [47973] 
939987 [47974] "I wonder you trouble yourself about it!"
939987 [47975] 
939987 [47976] "But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice
939987 [47977] with a switch--there were no marks even... don't regard me as a cynic,
939987 [47978] please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;
939987 [47979] but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased
939987 [47980] at my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to
939987 [47981] the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to
939987 [47982] sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,
939987 [47983] she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the
939987 [47984] letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her
939987 [47985] first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak
939987 [47986] of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be
939987 [47987] insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances
939987 [47988] of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to
939987 [47989] be insulted, have you noticed that? But it's particularly so with women.
939987 [47990] One might even say it's their only amusement."
939987 [47991] 
939987 [47992] At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so
939987 [47993] finishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence
939987 [47994] made him linger for a moment.
939987 [47995] 
939987 [47996] "You are fond of fighting?" he asked carelessly.
939987 [47997] 
939987 [47998] "No, not very," SvidrigaÃ¯lov answered, calmly. "And Marfa Petrovna and
939987 [47999] I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always
939987 [48000] pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not
939987 [48001] counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first
939987 [48002] time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the
939987 [48003] country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you
939987 [48004] suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?
939987 [48005] Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years
939987 [48006] ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I've forgotten
939987 [48007] his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having
939987 [48008] thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in
939987 [48009] those days, that very year I believe, the 'disgraceful action of the
939987 [48010] _Age_' took place (you know, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading,
939987 [48011] you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,
939987 [48012] where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,
939987 [48013] I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there
939987 [48014] for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking
939987 [48015] 'Germans' that I don't believe there is a progressive who could quite
939987 [48016] answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view
939987 [48017] then, but that's the truly humane point of view, I assure you."
939987 [48018] 
939987 [48019] After saying this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a sudden laugh again.
939987 [48020] Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his
939987 [48021] mind and able to keep it to himself.
939987 [48022] 
939987 [48023] "I expect you've not talked to anyone for some days?" he asked.
939987 [48024] 
939987 [48025] "Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an
939987 [48026] adaptable man?"
939987 [48027] 
939987 [48028] "No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man."
939987 [48029] 
939987 [48030] "Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that
939987 [48031] it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered," he replied,
939987 [48032] with a surprising expression of simplicity. "You know, there's
939987 [48033] hardly anything I take interest in," he went on, as it were dreamily,
939987 [48034] "especially now, I've nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to
939987 [48035] imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as
939987 [48036] I told you I want to see your sister about something. But I'll confess
939987 [48037] frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am
939987 [48038] delighted to see you.... Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you
939987 [48039] seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there's
939987 [48040] something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,
939987 [48041] but now, generally.... Well, well, I won't, I won't, don't scowl! I am
939987 [48042] not such a bear, you know, as you think."
939987 [48043] 
939987 [48044] Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
939987 [48045] 
939987 [48046] "You are not a bear, perhaps, at all," he said. "I fancy indeed that
939987 [48047] you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to
939987 [48048] behave like one."
939987 [48049] 
939987 [48050] "I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion," SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [48051] answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, "and therefore why
939987 [48052] not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our
939987 [48053] climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way," he
939987 [48054] added, laughing again.
939987 [48055] 
939987 [48056] "But I've heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, 'not
939987 [48057] without connections.' What can you want with me, then, unless you've
939987 [48058] some special object?"
939987 [48059] 
939987 [48060] "That's true that I have friends here," SvidrigaÃ¯lov admitted, not
939987 [48061] replying to the chief point. "I've met some already. I've been lounging
939987 [48062] about for the last three days, and I've seen them, or they've seen me.
939987 [48063] That's a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor
939987 [48064] man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn't affected me; my property
939987 [48065] consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not
939987 [48066] fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long
939987 [48067] ago. I've been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town
939987 [48068] it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of
939987 [48069] officials and students of all sorts. Yes, there's a great deal I didn't
939987 [48070] notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only
939987 [48071] hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!"
939987 [48072] 
939987 [48073] "Anatomy?"
939987 [48074] 
939987 [48075] "But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,
939987 [48076] maybe--well, all that can go on without me," he went on, again without
939987 [48077] noticing the question. "Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?"
939987 [48078] 
939987 [48079] "Why, have you been a card-sharper then?"
939987 [48080] 
939987 [48081] "How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best
939987 [48082] society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,
939987 [48083] you know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian
939987 [48084] society the best manners are found among those who've been thrashed,
939987 [48085] have you noticed that? I've deteriorated in the country. But I did get
939987 [48086] into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then
939987 [48087] Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for
939987 [48088] thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united
939987 [48089] in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.
939987 [48090] You know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For
939987 [48091] seven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life
939987 [48092] she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so
939987 [48093] if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at
939987 [48094] once! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in
939987 [48095] that."
939987 [48096] 
939987 [48097] "If it hadn't been for that, would you have given her the slip?"
939987 [48098] 
939987 [48099] "I don't know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I
939987 [48100] didn't want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go
939987 [48101] abroad, seeing I was bored, but I've been abroad before, and always
939987 [48102] felt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the
939987 [48103] sea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What's most revolting is
939987 [48104] that one is really sad! No, it's better at home. Here at least one
939987 [48105] blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone
939987 [48106] perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j'ai le vin
939987 [48107] mauvais_ and hate drinking, and there's nothing left but wine. I have
939987 [48108] tried it. But, I say, I've been told Berg is going up in a great balloon
939987 [48109] next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a
939987 [48110] fee. Is it true?"
939987 [48111] 
939987 [48112] "Why, would you go up?"
939987 [48113] 
939987 [48114] "I... No, oh, no," muttered SvidrigaÃ¯lov really seeming to be deep in
939987 [48115] thought.
939987 [48116] 
939987 [48117] "What does he mean? Is he in earnest?" Raskolnikov wondered.
939987 [48118] 
939987 [48119] "No, the document didn't restrain me," SvidrigaÃ¯lov went on,
939987 [48120] meditatively. "It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly
939987 [48121] a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day
939987 [48122] and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a
939987 [48123] fortune, you know. 'You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch'--that
939987 [48124] was actually her expression. You don't believe she used it? But do
939987 [48125] you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the
939987 [48126] neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,
939987 [48127] but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying."
939987 [48128] 
939987 [48129] "You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?"
939987 [48130] 
939987 [48131] "Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you
939987 [48132] believe in ghosts?"
939987 [48133] 
939987 [48134] "What ghosts?"
939987 [48135] 
939987 [48136] "Why, ordinary ghosts."
939987 [48137] 
939987 [48138] "Do you believe in them?"
939987 [48139] 
939987 [48140] "Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn't say no exactly."
939987 [48141] 
939987 [48142] "Do you see them, then?"
939987 [48143] 
939987 [48144] SvidrigaÃ¯lov looked at him rather oddly.
939987 [48145] 
939987 [48146] "Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me," he said, twisting his mouth
939987 [48147] into a strange smile.
939987 [48148] 
939987 [48149] "How do you mean 'she is pleased to visit you'?"
939987 [48150] 
939987 [48151] "She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the
939987 [48152] funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to
939987 [48153] come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on
939987 [48154] the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two
939987 [48155] hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone."
939987 [48156] 
939987 [48157] "Were you awake?"
939987 [48158] 
939987 [48159] "Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for
939987 [48160] a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear
939987 [48161] her."
939987 [48162] 
939987 [48163] "What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to
939987 [48164] you?" Raskolnikov said suddenly.
939987 [48165] 
939987 [48166] At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much
939987 [48167] excited.
939987 [48168] 
939987 [48169] "What! Did you think so?" SvidrigaÃ¯lov asked in astonishment. "Did you
939987 [48170] really? Didn't I say that there was something in common between us, eh?"
939987 [48171] 
939987 [48172] "You never said so!" Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.
939987 [48173] 
939987 [48174] "Didn't I?"
939987 [48175] 
939987 [48176] "No!"
939987 [48177] 
939987 [48178] "I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,
939987 [48179] pretending, I said to myself at once, 'Here's the man.'"
939987 [48180] 
939987 [48181] "What do you mean by 'the man?' What are you talking about?" cried
939987 [48182] Raskolnikov.
939987 [48183] 
939987 [48184] "What do I mean? I really don't know...." SvidrigaÃ¯lov muttered
939987 [48185] ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
939987 [48186] 
939987 [48187] For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other's faces.
939987 [48188] 
939987 [48189] "That's all nonsense!" Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. "What does she
939987 [48190] say when she comes to you?"
939987 [48191] 
939987 [48192] "She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man
939987 [48193] is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I
939987 [48194] was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch
939987 [48195] afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and
939987 [48196] began to think), she came in at the door. 'You've been so busy to-day,
939987 [48197] Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,'
939987 [48198] she said. All those seven years I've wound that clock every week, and if
939987 [48199] I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way
939987 [48200] here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out,
939987 [48201] with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and
939987 [48202] there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of
939987 [48203] cards in her hands. 'Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady
939987 [48204] Ivanovitch?' She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never
939987 [48205] forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,
939987 [48206] besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a
939987 [48207] miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden
939987 [48208] Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress
939987 [48209] with a long train. 'Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my
939987 [48210] dress? Aniska can't make like this.' (Aniska was a dressmaker in the
939987 [48211] country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a
939987 [48212] pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,
939987 [48213] and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. 'I wonder
939987 [48214] you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.' 'Good
939987 [48215] gracious, you won't let one disturb you about anything!' To tease her
939987 [48216] I said, 'I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.' 'That's just like you,
939987 [48217] Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a
939987 [48218] bride when you've hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good
939987 [48219] choice, at least, but I know it won't be for your happiness or hers, you
939987 [48220] will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.' Then she went out and
939987 [48221] her train seemed to rustle. Isn't it nonsense, eh?"
939987 [48222] 
939987 [48223] "But perhaps you are telling lies?" Raskolnikov put in.
939987 [48224] 
939987 [48225] "I rarely lie," answered SvidrigaÃ¯lov thoughtfully, apparently not
939987 [48226] noticing the rudeness of the question.
939987 [48227] 
939987 [48228] "And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?"
939987 [48229] 
939987 [48230] "Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had
939987 [48231] a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting 'Filka, my
939987 [48232] pipe!' He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat
939987 [48233] still and thought 'he is doing it out of revenge,' because we had a
939987 [48234] violent quarrel just before his death. 'How dare you come in with a hole
939987 [48235] in your elbow?' I said. 'Go away, you scamp!' He turned and went out,
939987 [48236] and never came again. I didn't tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted
939987 [48237] to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed."
939987 [48238] 
939987 [48239] "You should go to a doctor."
939987 [48240] 
939987 [48241] "I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don't know
939987 [48242] what's wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn't
939987 [48243] ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you
939987 [48244] believe that they exist."
939987 [48245] 
939987 [48246] "No, I won't believe it!" Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.
939987 [48247] 
939987 [48248] "What do people generally say?" muttered SvidrigaÃ¯lov, as though
939987 [48249] speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. "They say, 'You
939987 [48250] are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.' But that's not
939987 [48251] strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that
939987 [48252] only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that
939987 [48253] they don't exist."
939987 [48254] 
939987 [48255] "Nothing of the sort," Raskolnikov insisted irritably.
939987 [48256] 
939987 [48257] "No? You don't think so?" SvidrigaÃ¯lov went on, looking at him
939987 [48258] deliberately. "But what do you say to this argument (help me with
939987 [48259] it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the
939987 [48260] beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see
939987 [48261] them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the
939987 [48262] sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon
939987 [48263] as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is
939987 [48264] broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the
939987 [48265] more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with that
939987 [48266] other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that
939987 [48267] world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you
939987 [48268] could believe in that, too."
939987 [48269] 
939987 [48270] "I don't believe in a future life," said Raskolnikov.
939987 [48271] 
939987 [48272] SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat lost in thought.
939987 [48273] 
939987 [48274] "And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,"
939987 [48275] he said suddenly.
939987 [48276] 
939987 [48277] "He is a madman," thought Raskolnikov.
939987 [48278] 
939987 [48279] "We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,
939987 [48280] something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what
939987 [48281] if it's one little room, like a bath house in the country, black
939987 [48282] and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is? I
939987 [48283] sometimes fancy it like that."
939987 [48284] 
939987 [48285] "Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than
939987 [48286] that?" Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.
939987 [48287] 
939987 [48288] "Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know
939987 [48289] it's what I would certainly have made it," answered SvidrigaÃ¯lov, with a
939987 [48290] vague smile.
939987 [48291] 
939987 [48292] This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [48293] raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.
939987 [48294] 
939987 [48295] "Only think," he cried, "half an hour ago we had never seen each other,
939987 [48296] we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between
939987 [48297] us; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone into the abstract! Wasn't
939987 [48298] I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?"
939987 [48299] 
939987 [48300] "Kindly allow me," Raskolnikov went on irritably, "to ask you to explain
939987 [48301] why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,
939987 [48302] I have no time to waste. I want to go out."
939987 [48303] 
939987 [48304] "By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to
939987 [48305] be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?"
939987 [48306] 
939987 [48307] "Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning
939987 [48308] her name? I can't understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,
939987 [48309] if you really are SvidrigaÃ¯lov."
939987 [48310] 
939987 [48311] "Why, but I've come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning
939987 [48312] her?"
939987 [48313] 
939987 [48314] "Very good, speak, but make haste."
939987 [48315] 
939987 [48316] "I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.
939987 [48317] Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only
939987 [48318] seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no
939987 [48319] match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing
939987 [48320] herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of
939987 [48321] her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very
939987 [48322] glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly
939987 [48323] advantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it."
939987 [48324] 
939987 [48325] "All this is very naÃ¯ve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on
939987 [48326] your part," said Raskolnikov.
939987 [48327] 
939987 [48328] "You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don't be uneasy, Rodion
939987 [48329] Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have
939987 [48330] spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something
939987 [48331] psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for
939987 [48332] Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you
939987 [48333] that I've no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder
939987 [48334] myself indeed, for I really did feel something..."
939987 [48335] 
939987 [48336] "Through idleness and depravity," Raskolnikov put in.
939987 [48337] 
939987 [48338] "I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities
939987 [48339] that even I could not help being impressed by them. But that's all
939987 [48340] nonsense, as I see myself now."
939987 [48341] 
939987 [48342] "Have you seen that long?"
939987 [48343] 
939987 [48344] "I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the
939987 [48345] day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I
939987 [48346] still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya
939987 [48347] Romanovna's hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin."
939987 [48348] 
939987 [48349] "Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object
939987 [48350] of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out..."
939987 [48351] 
939987 [48352] "With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a
939987 [48353] certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary
939987 [48354] arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided
939987 [48355] for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should
939987 [48356] make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year
939987 [48357] ago. That's enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.
939987 [48358] Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.
939987 [48359] It's not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled
939987 [48360] with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.
939987 [48361] I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you
939987 [48362] like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she
939987 [48363] will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging
939987 [48364] her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten
939987 [48365] thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to
939987 [48366] which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way
939987 [48367] to it."
939987 [48368] 
939987 [48369] "You are certainly mad," cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as
939987 [48370] astonished. "How dare you talk like that!"
939987 [48371] 
939987 [48372] "I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not
939987 [48373] rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no
939987 [48374] need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste
939987 [48375] it in some more foolish way. That's the first thing. Secondly, my
939987 [48376] conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.
939987 [48377] You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will
939987 [48378] know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I
939987 [48379] greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely
939987 [48380] regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the
939987 [48381] unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show
939987 [48382] that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there
939987 [48383] were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not
939987 [48384] have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand
939987 [48385] only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,
939987 [48386] very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion
939987 [48387] of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that
939987 [48388] in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from
939987 [48389] another man. Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly
939987 [48390] and quietly."
939987 [48391] 
939987 [48392] SvidrigaÃ¯lov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying
939987 [48393] this.
939987 [48394] 
939987 [48395] "I beg you to say no more," said Raskolnikov. "In any case this is
939987 [48396] unpardonable impertinence."
939987 [48397] 
939987 [48398] "Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour
939987 [48399] in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good
939987 [48400] by trivial conventional formalities. That's absurd. If I died, for
939987 [48401] instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she
939987 [48402] wouldn't refuse it?"
939987 [48403] 
939987 [48404] "Very likely she would."
939987 [48405] 
939987 [48406] "Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten
939987 [48407] thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I
939987 [48408] beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna."
939987 [48409] 
939987 [48410] "No, I won't."
939987 [48411] 
939987 [48412] "In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her
939987 [48413] myself and worry her by doing so."
939987 [48414] 
939987 [48415] "And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?"
939987 [48416] 
939987 [48417] "I don't know really what to say. I should like very much to see her
939987 [48418] once more."
939987 [48419] 
939987 [48420] "Don't hope for it."
939987 [48421] 
939987 [48422] "I'm sorry. But you don't know me. Perhaps we may become better
939987 [48423] friends."
939987 [48424] 
939987 [48425] "You think we may become friends?"
939987 [48426] 
939987 [48427] "And why not?" SvidrigaÃ¯lov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.
939987 [48428] "I didn't quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning
939987 [48429] on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning."
939987 [48430] 
939987 [48431] "Where did you see me this morning?" Raskolnikov asked uneasily.
939987 [48432] 
939987 [48433] "I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you
939987 [48434] like me.... But don't be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on
939987 [48435] all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great
939987 [48436] personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about
939987 [48437] Raphael's _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov's album, and I never left Marfa
939987 [48438] Petrovna's side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at
939987 [48439] Viazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in
939987 [48440] a balloon with Berg, perhaps."
939987 [48441] 
939987 [48442] "Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?"
939987 [48443] 
939987 [48444] "What travels?"
939987 [48445] 
939987 [48446] "Why, on that 'journey'; you spoke of it yourself."
939987 [48447] 
939987 [48448] "A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that's a wide
939987 [48449] subject.... if only you knew what you are asking," he added, and gave
939987 [48450] a sudden, loud, short laugh. "Perhaps I'll get married instead of the
939987 [48451] journey. They're making a match for me."
939987 [48452] 
939987 [48453] "Here?"
939987 [48454] 
939987 [48455] "Yes."
939987 [48456] 
939987 [48457] "How have you had time for that?"
939987 [48458] 
939987 [48459] "But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg
939987 [48460] it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.
939987 [48461] Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered
939987 [48462] her in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That's absolutely
939987 [48463] certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was
939987 [48464] done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money
939987 [48465] in two or three weeks."
939987 [48466] 
939987 [48467] "Are you telling the truth?"
939987 [48468] 
939987 [48469] "Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you."
939987 [48470] 
939987 [48471] As he went out, SvidrigaÃ¯lov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.
939987 [48472] 
939987 [48473] 
939987 [48474] 
939987 [48475] CHAPTER II
939987 [48476] 
939987 [48477] It was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's,
939987 [48478] to arrive before Luzhin.
939987 [48479] 
939987 [48480] "Why, who was that?" asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the
939987 [48481] street.
939987 [48482] 
939987 [48483] "It was SvidrigaÃ¯lov, that landowner in whose house my sister was
939987 [48484] insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with
939987 [48485] his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This
939987 [48486] Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she's just
939987 [48487] died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don't
939987 [48488] know why I'm afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife's
939987 [48489] funeral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We
939987 [48490] must guard Dounia from him... that's what I wanted to tell you, do you
939987 [48491] hear?"
939987 [48492] 
939987 [48493] "Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,
939987 [48494] for speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does
939987 [48495] he live?"
939987 [48496] 
939987 [48497] "I don't know."
939987 [48498] 
939987 [48499] "Why didn't you ask? What a pity! I'll find out, though."
939987 [48500] 
939987 [48501] "Did you see him?" asked Raskolnikov after a pause.
939987 [48502] 
939987 [48503] "Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well."
939987 [48504] 
939987 [48505] "You did really see him? You saw him clearly?" Raskolnikov insisted.
939987 [48506] 
939987 [48507] "Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have
939987 [48508] a good memory for faces."
939987 [48509] 
939987 [48510] They were silent again.
939987 [48511] 
939987 [48512] "Hm!... that's all right," muttered Raskolnikov. "Do you know, I
939987 [48513] fancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination."
939987 [48514] 
939987 [48515] "What do you mean? I don't understand you."
939987 [48516] 
939987 [48517] "Well, you all say," Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a
939987 [48518] smile, "that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,
939987 [48519] and have only seen a phantom."
939987 [48520] 
939987 [48521] "What do you mean?"
939987 [48522] 
939987 [48523] "Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that
939987 [48524] happened all these days may be only imagination."
939987 [48525] 
939987 [48526] "Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did
939987 [48527] he come for?"
939987 [48528] 
939987 [48529] Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.
939987 [48530] 
939987 [48531] "Now let me tell you my story," he began, "I came to you, you were
939987 [48532] asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's, Zametov was
939987 [48533] still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn't speak in
939987 [48534] the right way. They don't seem to understand and can't understand, but
939987 [48535] are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking
939987 [48536] to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At
939987 [48537] last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'd
939987 [48538] brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was
939987 [48539] all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn't say a word. But, you see, I
939987 [48540] thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea
939987 [48541] struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger
939987 [48542] or anything, but why need you care? You needn't care a hang for them. We
939987 [48543] shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd
939987 [48544] mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they'll be afterwards! Hang
939987 [48545] them! We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!"
939987 [48546] 
939987 [48547] "To be sure," answered Raskolnikov. "But what will you say to-morrow?"
939987 [48548] he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never
939987 [48549] occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he
939987 [48550] thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin's account of his visit
939987 [48551] to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone
939987 [48552] since then.
939987 [48553] 
939987 [48554] In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually
939987 [48555] at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in
939987 [48556] together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men
939987 [48557] walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a
939987 [48558] little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came
939987 [48559] forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her
939987 [48560] brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with
939987 [48561] redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though
939987 [48562] he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria
939987 [48563] Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make
939987 [48564] them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia
939987 [48565] and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
939987 [48566] Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin
939987 [48567] was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.
939987 [48568] 
939987 [48569] A moment's silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a
939987 [48570] cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of
939987 [48571] a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to
939987 [48572] insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to
939987 [48573] keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp
939987 [48574] and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
939987 [48575] But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure
939987 [48576] uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so
939987 [48577] openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was
939987 [48578] better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and
939987 [48579] there would always be time for that.
939987 [48580] 
939987 [48581] "I trust you had a favourable journey," he inquired officially of
939987 [48582] Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [48583] 
939987 [48584] "Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch."
939987 [48585] 
939987 [48586] "I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued
939987 [48587] either?"
939987 [48588] 
939987 [48589] "I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain for
939987 [48590] mother," answered Dounia.
939987 [48591] 
939987 [48592] "That's unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.
939987 [48593] 'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my
939987 [48594] desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all
939987 [48595] passed off without inconvenience?"
939987 [48596] 
939987 [48597] "Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening," Pulcheria
939987 [48598] Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, "and if
939987 [48599] Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,
939987 [48600] we should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch
939987 [48601] Razumihin," she added, introducing him to Luzhin.
939987 [48602] 
939987 [48603] "I had the pleasure... yesterday," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a
939987 [48604] hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.
939987 [48605] 
939987 [48606] Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very
939987 [48607] polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,
939987 [48608] directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and
939987 [48609] become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
939987 [48610] Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya
939987 [48611] Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had
939987 [48612] nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.
939987 [48613] 
939987 [48614] "Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?" she began having recourse to
939987 [48615] her leading item of conversation.
939987 [48616] 
939987 [48617] "To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to
939987 [48618] make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [48619] set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife's funeral. So
939987 [48620] at least I have excellent authority for believing."
939987 [48621] 
939987 [48622] "To Petersburg? here?" Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.
939987 [48623] 
939987 [48624] "Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the
939987 [48625] rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it."
939987 [48626] 
939987 [48627] "Good heavens! won't he leave Dounia in peace even here?" cried
939987 [48628] Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [48629] 
939987 [48630] "I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for
939987 [48631] uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting
939987 [48632] into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now
939987 [48633] discovering where he is lodging."
939987 [48634] 
939987 [48635] "Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have
939987 [48636] given me," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: "I've only seen him twice,
939987 [48637] but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the
939987 [48638] cause of Marfa Petrovna's death."
939987 [48639] 
939987 [48640] "It's impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I
939987 [48641] do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of
939987 [48642] events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the
939987 [48643] general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am
939987 [48644] in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and
939987 [48645] precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within
939987 [48646] a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any
939987 [48647] pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is
939987 [48648] the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.
939987 [48649] I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so
939987 [48650] unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years
939987 [48651] ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions
939987 [48652] and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic
939987 [48653] and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to
939987 [48654] Siberia, was hushed up. That's the sort of man he is, if you care to
939987 [48655] know."
939987 [48656] 
939987 [48657] "Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened
939987 [48658] attentively.
939987 [48659] 
939987 [48660] "Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of
939987 [48661] this?" Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.
939987 [48662] 
939987 [48663] "I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must
939987 [48664] observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
939987 [48665] There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,
939987 [48666] a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other
939987 [48667] commissions, and with this woman SvidrigaÃ¯lov had for a long while close
939987 [48668] and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living
939987 [48669] with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than
939987 [48670] fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she
939987 [48671] used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in
939987 [48672] the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual
939987 [48673] proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that
939987 [48674] the child had been... cruelly outraged by SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It is true, this
939987 [48675] was not clearly established, the information was given by another German
939987 [48676] woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement
939987 [48677] was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money and
939987 [48678] exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very
939987 [48679] significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were
939987 [48680] with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he
939987 [48681] received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom."
939987 [48682] 
939987 [48683] "I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself."
939987 [48684] 
939987 [48685] "Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,
939987 [48686] to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.
939987 [48687] SvidrigaÃ¯lov."
939987 [48688] 
939987 [48689] "I don't know that," answered Dounia, dryly. "I only heard a queer story
939987 [48690] that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,
939987 [48691] the servants used to say, 'he read himself silly,' and that he hanged
939987 [48692] himself partly on account of Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov's mockery of him and not
939987 [48693] his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they
939987 [48694] were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for
939987 [48695] Philip's death."
939987 [48696] 
939987 [48697] "I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his
939987 [48698] defence all of a sudden," Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into
939987 [48699] an ambiguous smile, "there's no doubt that he is an astute man, and
939987 [48700] insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has
939987 [48701] died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be
939987 [48702] of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed
939987 [48703] efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it's
939987 [48704] my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison again.
939987 [48705] Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything
939987 [48706] substantial on him, having regard for his children's interests, and,
939987 [48707] if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,
939987 [48708] something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a
939987 [48709] man of his habits."
939987 [48710] 
939987 [48711] "Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you," said Dounia, "say no more of Mr.
939987 [48712] SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It makes me miserable."
939987 [48713] 
939987 [48714] "He has just been to see me," said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for
939987 [48715] the first time.
939987 [48716] 
939987 [48717] There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr
939987 [48718] Petrovitch was roused.
939987 [48719] 
939987 [48720] "An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and
939987 [48721] introduced himself," Raskolnikov continued. "He was fairly cheerful
939987 [48722] and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is
939987 [48723] particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at
939987 [48724] which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and
939987 [48725] he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa
939987 [48726] Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that
939987 [48727] you can receive the money very shortly."
939987 [48728] 
939987 [48729] "Thank God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. "Pray for
939987 [48730] her soul, Dounia!"
939987 [48731] 
939987 [48732] "It's a fact!" broke from Luzhin.
939987 [48733] 
939987 [48734] "Tell us, what more?" Dounia urged Raskolnikov.
939987 [48735] 
939987 [48736] "Then he said that he wasn't rich and all the estate was left to his
939987 [48737] children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere
939987 [48738] not far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask...."
939987 [48739] 
939987 [48740] "But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?" cried Pulcheria
939987 [48741] Alexandrovna in a fright. "Did he tell you?"
939987 [48742] 
939987 [48743] "Yes."
939987 [48744] 
939987 [48745] "What was it?"
939987 [48746] 
939987 [48747] "I'll tell you afterwards."
939987 [48748] 
939987 [48749] Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.
939987 [48750] 
939987 [48751] Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
939987 [48752] 
939987 [48753] "I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in
939987 [48754] your way," he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.
939987 [48755] 
939987 [48756] "Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch," said Dounia, "you intended to spend
939987 [48757] the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an
939987 [48758] explanation with mother."
939987 [48759] 
939987 [48760] "Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna," Pyotr Petrovitch answered
939987 [48761] impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. "I
939987 [48762] certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon
939987 [48763] a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly
939987 [48764] in my presence of some proposals of Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, I, too, do not
939987 [48765] desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...
939987 [48766] of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty
939987 [48767] and urgent request has been disregarded...."
939987 [48768] 
939987 [48769] Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.
939987 [48770] 
939987 [48771] "Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was
939987 [48772] disregarded solely at my instance," said Dounia. "You wrote that you
939987 [48773] had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at
939987 [48774] once, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,
939987 [48775] then he _should_ and _will_ apologise."
939987 [48776] 
939987 [48777] Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.
939987 [48778] 
939987 [48779] "There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us
939987 [48780] forget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;
939987 [48781] and when it has been overstepped, there is no return."
939987 [48782] 
939987 [48783] "That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia
939987 [48784] interrupted with some impatience. "Please understand that our whole
939987 [48785] future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as
939987 [48786] soon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at
939987 [48787] it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this
939987 [48788] business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that
939987 [48789] if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness."
939987 [48790] 
939987 [48791] "I am surprised at your putting the question like that," said Luzhin,
939987 [48792] getting more and more irritated. "Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,
939987 [48793] I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member
939987 [48794] of your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I
939987 [48795] cannot accept duties incompatible with..."
939987 [48796] 
939987 [48797] "Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia
939987 [48798] interrupted with feeling, "and be the sensible and generous man I have
939987 [48799] always considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I've given you a
939987 [48800] great promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe
939987 [48801] me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of
939987 [48802] judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted
939987 [48803] on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told
939987 [48804] him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not
939987 [48805] reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That
939987 [48806] is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don't want to be
939987 [48807] mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off
939987 [48808] with my brother, for my brother's sake I must break off with you. I can
939987 [48809] find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to
939987 [48810] know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,
939987 [48811] whether you are the husband for me."
939987 [48812] 
939987 [48813] "Avdotya Romanovna," Luzhin declared huffily, "your words are of too
939987 [48814] much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view
939987 [48815] of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say
939987 [48816] nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an
939987 [48817] impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to
939987 [48818] me. You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence I
939987 [48819] am in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship
939987 [48820] and... the obligations existing between us."
939987 [48821] 
939987 [48822] "What!" cried Dounia, flushing. "I set your interest beside all that has
939987 [48823] hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of
939987 [48824] my life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of
939987 [48825] you."
939987 [48826] 
939987 [48827] Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr
939987 [48828] Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he
939987 [48829] became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.
939987 [48830] 
939987 [48831] "Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to
939987 [48832] outweigh your love for your brother," he pronounced sententiously, "and
939987 [48833] in any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so
939987 [48834] emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother's presence,
939987 [48835] nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary
939987 [48836] explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.
939987 [48837] Your son," he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "yesterday in the
939987 [48838] presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that's it? excuse me I have
939987 [48839] forgotten your surname," he bowed politely to Razumihin) "insulted me by
939987 [48840] misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,
939987 [48841] drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had
939987 [48842] experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of
939987 [48843] view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable
939987 [48844] for the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the
939987 [48845] significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of
939987 [48846] malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your
939987 [48847] correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria
939987 [48848] Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite
939987 [48849] conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know
939987 [48850] in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion
939987 [48851] Romanovitch."
939987 [48852] 
939987 [48853] "I don't remember," faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I repeated them as
939987 [48854] I understood them. I don't know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps
939987 [48855] he exaggerated."
939987 [48856] 
939987 [48857] "He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation."
939987 [48858] 
939987 [48859] "Pyotr Petrovitch," Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, "the
939987 [48860] proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is
939987 [48861] the fact that we are here."
939987 [48862] 
939987 [48863] "Good, mother," said Dounia approvingly.
939987 [48864] 
939987 [48865] "Then this is my fault again," said Luzhin, aggrieved.
939987 [48866] 
939987 [48867] "Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have
939987 [48868] just written what was false about him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,
939987 [48869] gaining courage.
939987 [48870] 
939987 [48871] "I don't remember writing anything false."
939987 [48872] 
939987 [48873] "You wrote," Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, "that I
939987 [48874] gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was
939987 [48875] the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).
939987 [48876] You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that
939987 [48877] object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you
939987 [48878] don't know. All that is mean slander."
939987 [48879] 
939987 [48880] "Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, quivering with fury. "I enlarged upon
939987 [48881] your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your
939987 [48882] sister's and mother's inquiries, how I found you, and what impression
939987 [48883] you made on me. As for what you've alluded to in my letter, be so good
939987 [48884] as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn't
939987 [48885] throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that
939987 [48886] family, however unfortunate."
939987 [48887] 
939987 [48888] "To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little
939987 [48889] finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones."
939987 [48890] 
939987 [48891] "Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and
939987 [48892] sister?"
939987 [48893] 
939987 [48894] "I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day
939987 [48895] with mother and Dounia."
939987 [48896] 
939987 [48897] "Rodya!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin
939987 [48898] knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.
939987 [48899] 
939987 [48900] "You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna," he said, "whether it is
939987 [48901] possible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,
939987 [48902] once and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures
939987 [48903] of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets." He got up from his
939987 [48904] chair and took his hat. "But in withdrawing, I venture to request
939987 [48905] that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to
939987 [48906] say, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria
939987 [48907] Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to
939987 [48908] you and to no one else."
939987 [48909] 
939987 [48910] Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.
939987 [48911] 
939987 [48912] "You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr
939987 [48913] Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,
939987 [48914] she had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were
939987 [48915] laying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as
939987 [48916] a command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show
939987 [48917] particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown
939987 [48918] up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any
939987 [48919] case in a sense in your hands."
939987 [48920] 
939987 [48921] "That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the
939987 [48922] present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna's legacy, which
939987 [48923] seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me," he
939987 [48924] added sarcastically.
939987 [48925] 
939987 [48926] "Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were
939987 [48927] reckoning on our helplessness," Dounia observed irritably.
939987 [48928] 
939987 [48929] "But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire
939987 [48930] not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady
939987 [48931] Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov, which he has entrusted to your brother and
939987 [48932] which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest
939987 [48933] for you."
939987 [48934] 
939987 [48935] "Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [48936] 
939987 [48937] Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
939987 [48938] 
939987 [48939] "Aren't you ashamed now, sister?" asked Raskolnikov.
939987 [48940] 
939987 [48941] "I am ashamed, Rodya," said Dounia. "Pyotr Petrovitch, go away," she
939987 [48942] turned to him, white with anger.
939987 [48943] 
939987 [48944] Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
939987 [48945] He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the
939987 [48946] helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned
939987 [48947] pale, and his lips quivered.
939987 [48948] 
939987 [48949] "Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a
939987 [48950] dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider
939987 [48951] what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken."
939987 [48952] 
939987 [48953] "What insolence!" cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. "I don't
939987 [48954] want you to come back again."
939987 [48955] 
939987 [48956] "What! So that's how it stands!" cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the
939987 [48957] last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of
939987 [48958] his reckoning now. "So that's how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya
939987 [48959] Romanovna, that I might protest?"
939987 [48960] 
939987 [48961] "What right have you to speak to her like that?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [48962] intervened hotly. "And what can you protest about? What rights have you?
939987 [48963] Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!
939987 [48964] We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above
939987 [48965] all...."
939987 [48966] 
939987 [48967] "But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna," Luzhin stormed in a
939987 [48968] frenzy, "by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have
939987 [48969] been led on account of that into expenses...."
939987 [48970] 
939987 [48971] This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that
939987 [48972] Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,
939987 [48973] could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
939987 [48974] furious.
939987 [48975] 
939987 [48976] "Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the
939987 [48977] conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound
939987 [48978] you! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,
939987 [48979] hand and foot, not we!"
939987 [48980] 
939987 [48981] "Enough, mother, no more please," Avdotya Romanovna implored. "Pyotr
939987 [48982] Petrovitch, do be kind and go!"
939987 [48983] 
939987 [48984] "I am going, but one last word," he said, quite unable to control
939987 [48985] himself. "Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my
939987 [48986] mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread
939987 [48987] all over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public
939987 [48988] opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly
939987 [48989] might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for
939987 [48990] gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see
939987 [48991] myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the
939987 [48992] universal verdict...."
939987 [48993] 
939987 [48994] "Does the fellow want his head smashed?" cried Razumihin, jumping up.
939987 [48995] 
939987 [48996] "You are a mean and spiteful man!" cried Dounia.
939987 [48997] 
939987 [48998] "Not a word! Not a movement!" cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;
939987 [48999] then going close up to Luzhin, "Kindly leave the room!" he said quietly
939987 [49000] and distinctly, "and not a word more or..."
939987 [49001] 
939987 [49002] Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that
939987 [49003] worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man
939987 [49004] carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against
939987 [49005] Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is
939987 [49006] noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case
939987 [49007] was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were
939987 [49008] concerned, all might "very well indeed" be set right again.
939987 [49009] 
939987 [49010] 
939987 [49011] 
939987 [49012] CHAPTER III
939987 [49013] 
939987 [49014] The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an
939987 [49015] ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that
939987 [49016] two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This
939987 [49017] conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to
939987 [49018] the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from
939987 [49019] insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest
939987 [49020] opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated
939987 [49021] in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued
939987 [49022] above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts
939987 [49023] of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his
939987 [49024] superiors.
939987 [49025] 
939987 [49026] When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in
939987 [49027] spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity
939987 [49028] and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such "black ingratitude."
939987 [49029] And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the
939987 [49030] groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere
939987 [49031] contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the
939987 [49032] townspeople, who were warm in Dounia'a defence. And he would not have
939987 [49033] denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly
939987 [49034] of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as
939987 [49035] something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret
939987 [49036] feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that
939987 [49037] others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with
939987 [49038] the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good
939987 [49039] deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he
939987 [49040] considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
939987 [49041] 
939987 [49042] Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
939987 [49043] For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had
939987 [49044] gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound
939987 [49045] secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),
939987 [49046] very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one
939987 [49047] who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who
939987 [49048] would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him
939987 [49049] and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined
939987 [49050] on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,
939987 [49051] behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and
939987 [49052] education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position
939987 [49053] had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he
939987 [49054] dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education
939987 [49055] and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would
939987 [49056] be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and
939987 [49057] would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,
939987 [49058] unbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long
939987 [49059] reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and
939987 [49060] was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his
939987 [49061] cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely
939987 [49062] to be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune
939987 [49063] in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The
939987 [49064] fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make
939987 [49065] his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing
939987 [49066] an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden
939987 [49067] horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a
939987 [49068] hideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,
939987 [49069] had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried
939987 [49070] away--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love
939987 [49071] Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all
939987 [49072] at once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,
939987 [49073] smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop
939987 [49074] who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help
939987 [49075] recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;
939987 [49076] as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man
939987 [49077] he really dreaded in earnest was SvidrigaÃ¯lov.... He had, in short, a
939987 [49078] great deal to attend to....
939987 [49079] 
939987 [49080] *****
939987 [49081] 
939987 [49082] "No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!" said Dounia, kissing and
939987 [49083] embracing her mother. "I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,
939987 [49084] brother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him
939987 [49085] before, nothing would have tempted me! Don't blame me, brother!"
939987 [49086] 
939987 [49087] "God has delivered us! God has delivered us!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna
939987 [49088] muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what
939987 [49089] had happened.
939987 [49090] 
939987 [49091] They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now
939987 [49092] and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.
939987 [49093] Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:
939987 [49094] she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible
939987 [49095] misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his
939987 [49096] joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight
939987 [49097] had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to
939987 [49098] them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to
939987 [49099] think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination
939987 [49100] range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and
939987 [49101] indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of
939987 [49102] Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia
939987 [49103] could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria
939987 [49104] Alexandrovna watched him timidly.
939987 [49105] 
939987 [49106] "What did SvidrigaÃ¯lov say to you?" said Dounia, approaching him.
939987 [49107] 
939987 [49108] "Yes, yes!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
939987 [49109] 
939987 [49110] Raskolnikov raised his head.
939987 [49111] 
939987 [49112] "He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires
939987 [49113] to see you once in my presence."
939987 [49114] 
939987 [49115] "See her! On no account!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "And how dare he
939987 [49116] offer her money!"
939987 [49117] 
939987 [49118] Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with
939987 [49119] SvidrigaÃ¯lov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa
939987 [49120] Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.
939987 [49121] 
939987 [49122] "What answer did you give him?" asked Dounia.
939987 [49123] 
939987 [49124] "At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that
939987 [49125] he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.
939987 [49126] He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he
939987 [49127] has no feeling for you. He doesn't want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk
939987 [49128] was altogether rather muddled."
939987 [49129] 
939987 [49130] "How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?"
939987 [49131] 
939987 [49132] "I must confess I don't quite understand him. He offers you ten
939987 [49133] thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and
939987 [49134] in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says is he going to be
939987 [49135] married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,
939987 [49136] and probably a bad one. But it's odd that he should be so clumsy about
939987 [49137] it if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this
939987 [49138] money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very
939987 [49139] strange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;
939987 [49140] that may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems
939987 [49141] to have made a great impression on him."
939987 [49142] 
939987 [49143] "God rest her soul," exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I shall always,
939987 [49144] always pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three
939987 [49145] thousand! It's as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this
939987 [49146] morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were
939987 [49147] just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man
939987 [49148] until he offered help."
939987 [49149] 
939987 [49150] Dounia seemed strangely impressed by SvidrigaÃ¯lov's offer. She still
939987 [49151] stood meditating.
939987 [49152] 
939987 [49153] "He has got some terrible plan," she said in a half whisper to herself,
939987 [49154] almost shuddering.
939987 [49155] 
939987 [49156] Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
939987 [49157] 
939987 [49158] "I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again," he said to
939987 [49159] Dounia.
939987 [49160] 
939987 [49161] "We will watch him! I will track him out!" cried Razumihin, vigorously.
939987 [49162] "I won't lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me
939987 [49163] himself just now. 'Take care of my sister.' Will you give me leave, too,
939987 [49164] Avdotya Romanovna?"
939987 [49165] 
939987 [49166] Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not
939987 [49167] leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the
939987 [49168] three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.
939987 [49169] 
939987 [49170] A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively
939987 [49171] conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,
939987 [49172] though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.
939987 [49173] 
939987 [49174] "And why, why should you go away?" he flowed on ecstatically. "And what
939987 [49175] are you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here
939987 [49176] together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.
939987 [49177] For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we'll
939987 [49178] plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I'll explain it all in detail to
939987 [49179] you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,
939987 [49180] before anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must
939987 [49181] introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).
939987 [49182] This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his
939987 [49183] pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has
939987 [49184] been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.
939987 [49185] interest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year
939987 [49186] I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as
939987 [49187] he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have
939987 [49188] enough for a start, so we'll go into partnership, and what are we going
939987 [49189] to do?"
939987 [49190] 
939987 [49191] Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length
939987 [49192] that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all
939987 [49193] of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad
939987 [49194] publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give
939987 [49195] a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been
939987 [49196] dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had
939987 [49197] been working in publishers' offices, and knew three European languages
939987 [49198] well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was
939987 [49199] "schwach" in German with an object of persuading him to take half his
939987 [49200] translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and
939987 [49201] Raskolnikov knew he was lying.
939987 [49202] 
939987 [49203] "Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief
939987 [49204] means of success--money of our own!" cried Razumihin warmly. "Of course
939987 [49205] there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,
939987 [49206] I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And
939987 [49207] the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants
939987 [49208] translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at
939987 [49209] once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years
939987 [49210] I've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every
939987 [49211] detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe
939987 [49212] me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept
939987 [49213] the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles
939987 [49214] simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would
939987 [49215] not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you
939987 [49216] think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he'd hesitate--they are
939987 [49217] such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,
939987 [49218] you trust to me, I know my way about. We'll begin in a small way and go
939987 [49219] on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get
939987 [49220] back our capital."
939987 [49221] 
939987 [49222] Dounia's eyes shone.
939987 [49223] 
939987 [49224] "I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!" she said.
939987 [49225] 
939987 [49226] "I know nothing about it, of course," put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
939987 [49227] "it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It's new and untried. Of
939987 [49228] course, we must remain here at least for a time." She looked at Rodya.
939987 [49229] 
939987 [49230] "What do you think, brother?" said Dounia.
939987 [49231] 
939987 [49232] "I think he's got a very good idea," he answered. "Of course, it's too
939987 [49233] soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out
939987 [49234] five or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself
939987 [49235] which would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,
939987 [49236] there's no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can
939987 [49237] talk it over later...."
939987 [49238] 
939987 [49239] "Hurrah!" cried Razumihin. "Now, stay, there's a flat here in this
939987 [49240] house, belonging to the same owner. It's a special flat apart, not
939987 [49241] communicating with these lodgings. It's furnished, rent moderate,
939987 [49242] three rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I'll pawn your watch
939987 [49243] to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.
939987 [49244] You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where
939987 [49245] are you off to, Rodya?"
939987 [49246] 
939987 [49247] "What, Rodya, you are going already?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in
939987 [49248] dismay.
939987 [49249] 
939987 [49250] "At such a minute?" cried Razumihin.
939987 [49251] 
939987 [49252] Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in
939987 [49253] his hand, he was preparing to leave them.
939987 [49254] 
939987 [49255] "One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever," he
939987 [49256] said somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a
939987 [49257] smile. "But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each
939987 [49258] other..." he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it
939987 [49259] somehow was uttered aloud.
939987 [49260] 
939987 [49261] "What is the matter with you?" cried his mother.
939987 [49262] 
939987 [49263] "Where are you going, Rodya?" asked Dounia rather strangely.
939987 [49264] 
939987 [49265] "Oh, I'm quite obliged to..." he answered vaguely, as though hesitating
939987 [49266] what he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his
939987 [49267] white face.
939987 [49268] 
939987 [49269] "I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,
939987 [49270] and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I
939987 [49271] feel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of
939987 [49272] myself... when it's possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,
939987 [49273] leave me alone. I decided this even before... I'm absolutely resolved on
939987 [49274] it. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be
939987 [49275] alone. Forget me altogether, it's better. Don't inquire about me. When
939987 [49276] I can, I'll come of myself or... I'll send for you. Perhaps it will all
939987 [49277] come back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to
939987 [49278] hate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!"
939987 [49279] 
939987 [49280] "Good God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister
939987 [49281] were terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.
939987 [49282] 
939987 [49283] "Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!" cried his
939987 [49284] poor mother.
939987 [49285] 
939987 [49286] He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia
939987 [49287] overtook him.
939987 [49288] 
939987 [49289] "Brother, what are you doing to mother?" she whispered, her eyes
939987 [49290] flashing with indignation.
939987 [49291] 
939987 [49292] He looked dully at her.
939987 [49293] 
939987 [49294] "No matter, I shall come.... I'm coming," he muttered in an undertone,
939987 [49295] as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of
939987 [49296] the room.
939987 [49297] 
939987 [49298] "Wicked, heartless egoist!" cried Dounia.
939987 [49299] 
939987 [49300] "He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don't you see it? You're
939987 [49301] heartless after that!" Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing
939987 [49302] her hand tightly. "I shall be back directly," he shouted to the
939987 [49303] horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.
939987 [49304] 
939987 [49305] Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.
939987 [49306] 
939987 [49307] "I knew you would run after me," he said. "Go back to them--be with
939987 [49308] them... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall
939987 [49309] come... if I can. Good-bye."
939987 [49310] 
939987 [49311] And without holding out his hand he walked away.
939987 [49312] 
939987 [49313] "But where are you going? What are you doing? What's the matter with
939987 [49314] you? How can you go on like this?" Razumihin muttered, at his wits' end.
939987 [49315] 
939987 [49316] Raskolnikov stopped once more.
939987 [49317] 
939987 [49318] "Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.
939987 [49319] Don't come to see me. Maybe I'll come here.... Leave me, but _don't
939987 [49320] leave_ them. Do you understand me?"
939987 [49321] 
939987 [49322] It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a
939987 [49323] minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered
939987 [49324] that minute all his life. Raskolnikov's burning and intent eyes
939987 [49325] grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his
939987 [49326] consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it
939987 [49327] were, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,
939987 [49328] something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....
939987 [49329] Razumihin turned pale.
939987 [49330] 
939987 [49331] "Do you understand now?" said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.
939987 [49332] "Go back, go to them," he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went
939987 [49333] out of the house.
939987 [49334] 
939987 [49335] I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,
939987 [49336] how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his
939987 [49337] illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every
939987 [49338] day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,
939987 [49339] that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the
939987 [49340] best doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took
939987 [49341] his place with them as a son and a brother.
939987 [49342] 
939987 [49343] 
939987 [49344] 
939987 [49345] CHAPTER IV
939987 [49346] 
939987 [49347] Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia
939987 [49348] lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the
939987 [49349] porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of
939987 [49350] Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard
939987 [49351] the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second
939987 [49352] floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey
939987 [49353] over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where
939987 [49354] to turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him; he
939987 [49355] mechanically took hold of it.
939987 [49356] 
939987 [49357] "Who is there?" a woman's voice asked uneasily.
939987 [49358] 
939987 [49359] "It's I... come to see you," answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the
939987 [49360] tiny entry.
939987 [49361] 
939987 [49362] On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.
939987 [49363] 
939987 [49364] "It's you! Good heavens!" cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to
939987 [49365] the spot.
939987 [49366] 
939987 [49367] "Which is your room? This way?" and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at
939987 [49368] her, hastened in.
939987 [49369] 
939987 [49370] A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the
939987 [49371] candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly
939987 [49372] agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour
939987 [49373] rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She
939987 [49374] felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly
939987 [49375] and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.
939987 [49376] 
939987 [49377] It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the
939987 [49378] Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
939987 [49379] In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always
939987 [49380] kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.
939987 [49381] Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and
939987 [49382] this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking
939987 [49383] out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute
939987 [49384] angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
939987 [49385] The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any
939987 [49386] furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,
939987 [49387] beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a
939987 [49388] blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other
939987 [49389] flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite
939987 [49390] wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers
939987 [49391] looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the
939987 [49392] room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the
939987 [49393] corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There
939987 [49394] was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.
939987 [49395] 
939987 [49396] Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and
939987 [49397] unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble
939987 [49398] with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter
939987 [49399] of her destinies.
939987 [49400] 
939987 [49401] "I am late.... It's eleven, isn't it?" he asked, still not lifting his
939987 [49402] eyes.
939987 [49403] 
939987 [49404] "Yes," muttered Sonia, "oh yes, it is," she added, hastily, as though in
939987 [49405] that lay her means of escape. "My landlady's clock has just struck... I
939987 [49406] heard it myself...."
939987 [49407] 
939987 [49408] "I've come to you for the last time," Raskolnikov went on gloomily,
939987 [49409] although this was the first time. "I may perhaps not see you again..."
939987 [49410] 
939987 [49411] "Are you... going away?"
939987 [49412] 
939987 [49413] "I don't know... to-morrow...."
939987 [49414] 
939987 [49415] "Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?" Sonia's voice
939987 [49416] shook.
939987 [49417] 
939987 [49418] "I don't know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I've
939987 [49419] come to say one word...."
939987 [49420] 
939987 [49421] He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was
939987 [49422] sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.
939987 [49423] 
939987 [49424] "Why are you standing? Sit down," he said in a changed voice, gentle and
939987 [49425] friendly.
939987 [49426] 
939987 [49427] She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.
939987 [49428] 
939987 [49429] "How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand."
939987 [49430] 
939987 [49431] He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.
939987 [49432] 
939987 [49433] "I have always been like that," she said.
939987 [49434] 
939987 [49435] "Even when you lived at home?"
939987 [49436] 
939987 [49437] "Yes."
939987 [49438] 
939987 [49439] "Of course, you were," he added abruptly and the expression of his face
939987 [49440] and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.
939987 [49441] 
939987 [49442] He looked round him once more.
939987 [49443] 
939987 [49444] "You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?"
939987 [49445] 
939987 [49446] "Yes...."
939987 [49447] 
939987 [49448] "They live there, through that door?"
939987 [49449] 
939987 [49450] "Yes.... They have another room like this."
939987 [49451] 
939987 [49452] "All in one room?"
939987 [49453] 
939987 [49454] "Yes."
939987 [49455] 
939987 [49456] "I should be afraid in your room at night," he observed gloomily.
939987 [49457] 
939987 [49458] "They are very good people, very kind," answered Sonia, who still seemed
939987 [49459] bewildered, "and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.
939987 [49460] And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me."
939987 [49461] 
939987 [49462] "They all stammer, don't they?"
939987 [49463] 
939987 [49464] "Yes.... He stammers and he's lame. And his wife, too.... It's not
939987 [49465] exactly that she stammers, but she can't speak plainly. She is a very
939987 [49466] kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven
939987 [49467] children... and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the others
939987 [49468] are simply ill... but they don't stammer.... But where did you hear
939987 [49469] about them?" she added with some surprise.
939987 [49470] 
939987 [49471] "Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you
939987 [49472] went out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [49473] knelt down by your bed."
939987 [49474] 
939987 [49475] Sonia was confused.
939987 [49476] 
939987 [49477] "I fancied I saw him to-day," she whispered hesitatingly.
939987 [49478] 
939987 [49479] "Whom?"
939987 [49480] 
939987 [49481] "Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten
939987 [49482] o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I
939987 [49483] wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna...."
939987 [49484] 
939987 [49485] "You were walking in the streets?"
939987 [49486] 
939987 [49487] "Yes," Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and
939987 [49488] looking down.
939987 [49489] 
939987 [49490] "Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?"
939987 [49491] 
939987 [49492] "Oh no, what are you saying? No!" Sonia looked at him almost with
939987 [49493] dismay.
939987 [49494] 
939987 [49495] "You love her, then?"
939987 [49496] 
939987 [49497] "Love her? Of course!" said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she
939987 [49498] clasped her hands in distress. "Ah, you don't.... If you only knew!
939987 [49499] You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you
939987 [49500] see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how
939987 [49501] kind! Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!"
939987 [49502] 
939987 [49503] Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement
939987 [49504] and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in
939987 [49505] her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that
939987 [49506] she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort
939987 [49507] of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in
939987 [49508] every feature of her face.
939987 [49509] 
939987 [49510] "Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,
939987 [49511] what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so
939987 [49512] unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,
939987 [49513] she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness
939987 [49514] everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she
939987 [49515] wouldn't do wrong. She doesn't see that it's impossible for people to
939987 [49516] be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is
939987 [49517] good!"
939987 [49518] 
939987 [49519] "And what will happen to you?"
939987 [49520] 
939987 [49521] Sonia looked at him inquiringly.
939987 [49522] 
939987 [49523] "They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands
939987 [49524] before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,
939987 [49525] how will it be now?"
939987 [49526] 
939987 [49527] "I don't know," Sonia articulated mournfully.
939987 [49528] 
939987 [49529] "Will they stay there?"
939987 [49530] 
939987 [49531] "I don't know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,
939987 [49532] I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina
939987 [49533] Ivanovna says that she won't stay another minute."
939987 [49534] 
939987 [49535] "How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?"
939987 [49536] 
939987 [49537] "Oh, no, don't talk like that.... We are one, we live like one." Sonia
939987 [49538] was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other
939987 [49539] little bird were to be angry. "And what could she do? What, what could
939987 [49540] she do?" she persisted, getting hot and excited. "And how she cried
939987 [49541] to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it? At one minute she
939987 [49542] is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the
939987 [49543] lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,
939987 [49544] weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the
939987 [49545] wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her
939987 [49546] hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will
939987 [49547] borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and
939987 [49548] set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to
939987 [49549] superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses
939987 [49550] and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in
939987 [49551] her fancies! One can't contradict her. And all the day long she has been
939987 [49552] washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with
939987 [49553] her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this
939987 [49554] morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are
939987 [49555] quite worn out. Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearly
939987 [49556] enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,
939987 [49557] you don't know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the
939987 [49558] shopmen because she hadn't enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her...."
939987 [49559] 
939987 [49560] "Well, after that I can understand your living like this," Raskolnikov
939987 [49561] said with a bitter smile.
939987 [49562] 
939987 [49563] "And aren't you sorry for them? Aren't you sorry?" Sonia flew at him
939987 [49564] again. "Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'd
939987 [49565] seen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything, oh dear! And how
939987 [49566] often, how often I've brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only
939987 [49567] a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I've done it! Ah,
939987 [49568] I've been wretched at the thought of it all day!"
939987 [49569] 
939987 [49570] Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.
939987 [49571] 
939987 [49572] "You were cruel?"
939987 [49573] 
939987 [49574] "Yes, I--I. I went to see them," she went on, weeping, "and father said,
939987 [49575] 'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.' He
939987 [49576] had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives
939987 [49577] there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, 'I
939987 [49578] can't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to show
939987 [49579] Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some
939987 [49580] collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina
939987 [49581] Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself
939987 [49582] in the glass and was delighted with them. 'Make me a present of them,
939987 [49583] Sonia,' she said, 'please do.' '_Please do_,' she said, she wanted them
939987 [49584] so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old
939987 [49585] happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she
939987 [49586] has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn't had all these years!
939987 [49587] And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she'd sooner give
939987 [49588] away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I
939987 [49589] was sorry to give them. 'What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' I
939987 [49590] said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave
939987 [49591] me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.
939987 [49592] And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,
939987 [49593] but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,
939987 [49594] change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it's nothing to you!"
939987 [49595] 
939987 [49596] "Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?"
939987 [49597] 
939987 [49598] "Yes.... Did you know her?" Sonia asked with some surprise.
939987 [49599] 
939987 [49600] "Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon
939987 [49601] die," said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.
939987 [49602] 
939987 [49603] "Oh, no, no, no!"
939987 [49604] 
939987 [49605] And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring
939987 [49606] that she should not.
939987 [49607] 
939987 [49608] "But it will be better if she does die."
939987 [49609] 
939987 [49610] "No, not better, not at all better!" Sonia unconsciously repeated in
939987 [49611] dismay.
939987 [49612] 
939987 [49613] "And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?"
939987 [49614] 
939987 [49615] "Oh, I don't know," cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her
939987 [49616] hands to her head.
939987 [49617] 
939987 [49618] It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and
939987 [49619] he had only roused it again.
939987 [49620] 
939987 [49621] "And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill
939987 [49622] and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?" he persisted
939987 [49623] pitilessly.
939987 [49624] 
939987 [49625] "How can you? That cannot be!"
939987 [49626] 
939987 [49627] And Sonia's face worked with awful terror.
939987 [49628] 
939987 [49629] "Cannot be?" Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. "You are not
939987 [49630] insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will
939987 [49631] be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head
939987 [49632] against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....
939987 [49633] Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the
939987 [49634] hospital, she will die, and the children..."
939987 [49635] 
939987 [49636] "Oh, no.... God will not let it be!" broke at last from Sonia's
939987 [49637] overburdened bosom.
939987 [49638] 
939987 [49639] She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb
939987 [49640] entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.
939987 [49641] 
939987 [49642] Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.
939987 [49643] Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible
939987 [49644] dejection.
939987 [49645] 
939987 [49646] "And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day?" he asked, stopping
939987 [49647] suddenly before her.
939987 [49648] 
939987 [49649] "No," whispered Sonia.
939987 [49650] 
939987 [49651] "Of course not. Have you tried?" he added almost ironically.
939987 [49652] 
939987 [49653] "Yes."
939987 [49654] 
939987 [49655] "And it didn't come off! Of course not! No need to ask."
939987 [49656] 
939987 [49657] And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.
939987 [49658] 
939987 [49659] "You don't get money every day?"
939987 [49660] 
939987 [49661] Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.
939987 [49662] 
939987 [49663] "No," she whispered with a painful effort.
939987 [49664] 
939987 [49665] "It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt," he said suddenly.
939987 [49666] 
939987 [49667] "No, no! It can't be, no!" Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though
939987 [49668] she had been stabbed. "God would not allow anything so awful!"
939987 [49669] 
939987 [49670] "He lets others come to it."
939987 [49671] 
939987 [49672] "No, no! God will protect her, God!" she repeated beside herself.
939987 [49673] 
939987 [49674] "But, perhaps, there is no God at all," Raskolnikov answered with a sort
939987 [49675] of malignance, laughed and looked at her.
939987 [49676] 
939987 [49677] Sonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at
939987 [49678] him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not
939987 [49679] speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
939987 [49680] 
939987 [49681] "You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind is
939987 [49682] unhinged," he said after a brief silence.
939987 [49683] 
939987 [49684] Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not
939987 [49685] looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put
939987 [49686] his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful
939987 [49687] face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were
939987 [49688] twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the
939987 [49689] ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And
939987 [49690] certainly he looked like a madman.
939987 [49691] 
939987 [49692] "What are you doing to me?" she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden
939987 [49693] anguish clutched at her heart.
939987 [49694] 
939987 [49695] He stood up at once.
939987 [49696] 
939987 [49697] "I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of
939987 [49698] humanity," he said wildly and walked away to the window. "Listen," he
939987 [49699] added, turning to her a minute later. "I said just now to an insolent
939987 [49700] man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister
939987 [49701] honour making her sit beside you."
939987 [49702] 
939987 [49703] "Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?" cried Sonia,
939987 [49704] frightened. "Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I'm... dishonourable....
939987 [49705] Ah, why did you say that?"
939987 [49706] 
939987 [49707] "It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,
939987 [49708] but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that's
939987 [49709] true," he added almost solemnly, "and your worst sin is that you have
939987 [49710] destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn't that fearful? Isn't
939987 [49711] it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at
939987 [49712] the same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that you
939987 [49713] are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,"
939987 [49714] he went on almost in a frenzy, "how this shame and degradation can exist
939987 [49715] in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be
939987 [49716] better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end
939987 [49717] it all!"
939987 [49718] 
939987 [49719] "But what would become of them?" Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with
939987 [49720] eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.
939987 [49721] 
939987 [49722] Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she
939987 [49723] must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly
939987 [49724] she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that
939987 [49725] now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed
939987 [49726] the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his
939987 [49727] peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,
939987 [49728] and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought
939987 [49729] of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long
939987 [49730] tortured her. "What, what," he thought, "could hitherto have hindered
939987 [49731] her from putting an end to it?" Only then he realised what those poor
939987 [49732] little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,
939987 [49733] knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.
939987 [49734] 
939987 [49735] But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and
939987 [49736] the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any
939987 [49737] case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she
939987 [49738] have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,
939987 [49739] since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he
939987 [49740] knew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not
939987 [49741] unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her
939987 [49742] tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,
939987 [49743] have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her
939987 [49744] up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched
939987 [49745] her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her
939987 [49746] heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....
939987 [49747] 
939987 [49748] "There are three ways before her," he thought, "the canal, the madhouse,
939987 [49749] or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns
939987 [49750] the heart to stone."
939987 [49751] 
939987 [49752] The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was
939987 [49753] young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing
939987 [49754] that the last end was the most likely.
939987 [49755] 
939987 [49756] "But can that be true?" he cried to himself. "Can that creature who has
939987 [49757] still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last
939987 [49758] into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have
939987 [49759] begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,
939987 [49760] because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot
939987 [49761] be!" he cried, as Sonia had just before. "No, what has kept her from the
939987 [49762] canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she
939987 [49763] has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her
939987 [49764] mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?
939987 [49765] How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she
939987 [49766] is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she
939987 [49767] expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn't that all mean madness?"
939987 [49768] 
939987 [49769] He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed
939987 [49770] better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.
939987 [49771] 
939987 [49772] "So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?" he asked her.
939987 [49773] 
939987 [49774] Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.
939987 [49775] 
939987 [49776] "What should I be without God?" she whispered rapidly, forcibly,
939987 [49777] glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.
939987 [49778] 
939987 [49779] "Ah, so that is it!" he thought.
939987 [49780] 
939987 [49781] "And what does God do for you?" he asked, probing her further.
939987 [49782] 
939987 [49783] Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak
939987 [49784] chest kept heaving with emotion.
939987 [49785] 
939987 [49786] "Be silent! Don't ask! You don't deserve!" she cried suddenly, looking
939987 [49787] sternly and wrathfully at him.
939987 [49788] 
939987 [49789] "That's it, that's it," he repeated to himself.
939987 [49790] 
939987 [49791] "He does everything," she whispered quickly, looking down again.
939987 [49792] 
939987 [49793] "That's the way out! That's the explanation," he decided, scrutinising
939987 [49794] her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.
939987 [49795] He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft
939987 [49796] blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that
939987 [49797] little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed
939987 [49798] to him more and more strange, almost impossible. "She is a religious
939987 [49799] maniac!" he repeated to himself.
939987 [49800] 
939987 [49801] There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every
939987 [49802] time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.
939987 [49803] It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in
939987 [49804] leather, old and worn.
939987 [49805] 
939987 [49806] "Where did you get that?" he called to her across the room.
939987 [49807] 
939987 [49808] She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.
939987 [49809] 
939987 [49810] "It was brought me," she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking
939987 [49811] at him.
939987 [49812] 
939987 [49813] "Who brought it?"
939987 [49814] 
939987 [49815] "Lizaveta, I asked her for it."
939987 [49816] 
939987 [49817] "Lizaveta! strange!" he thought.
939987 [49818] 
939987 [49819] Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every
939987 [49820] moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the
939987 [49821] pages.
939987 [49822] 
939987 [49823] "Where is the story of Lazarus?" he asked suddenly.
939987 [49824] 
939987 [49825] Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was
939987 [49826] standing sideways to the table.
939987 [49827] 
939987 [49828] "Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia."
939987 [49829] 
939987 [49830] She stole a glance at him.
939987 [49831] 
939987 [49832] "You are not looking in the right place.... It's in the fourth gospel,"
939987 [49833] she whispered sternly, without looking at him.
939987 [49834] 
939987 [49835] "Find it and read it to me," he said. He sat down with his elbow on the
939987 [49836] table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to
939987 [49837] listen.
939987 [49838] 
939987 [49839] "In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be
939987 [49840] there if I am not in a worse place," he muttered to himself.
939987 [49841] 
939987 [49842] Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly
939987 [49843] to the table. She took the book however.
939987 [49844] 
939987 [49845] "Haven't you read it?" she asked, looking up at him across the table.
939987 [49846] 
939987 [49847] Her voice became sterner and sterner.
939987 [49848] 
939987 [49849] "Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!"
939987 [49850] 
939987 [49851] "And haven't you heard it in church?"
939987 [49852] 
939987 [49853] "I... haven't been. Do you often go?"
939987 [49854] 
939987 [49855] "N-no," whispered Sonia.
939987 [49856] 
939987 [49857] Raskolnikov smiled.
939987 [49858] 
939987 [49859] "I understand.... And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?"
939987 [49860] 
939987 [49861] "Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem
939987 [49862] service."
939987 [49863] 
939987 [49864] "For whom?"
939987 [49865] 
939987 [49866] "For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe."
939987 [49867] 
939987 [49868] His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.
939987 [49869] 
939987 [49870] "Were you friends with Lizaveta?"
939987 [49871] 
939987 [49872] "Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she
939987 [49873] couldn't.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God."
939987 [49874] 
939987 [49875] The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new
939987 [49876] again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious
939987 [49877] maniacs.
939987 [49878] 
939987 [49879] "I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It's infectious!"
939987 [49880] 
939987 [49881] "Read!" he cried irritably and insistently.
939987 [49882] 
939987 [49883] Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read
939987 [49884] to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the "unhappy lunatic."
939987 [49885] 
939987 [49886] "What for? You don't believe?..." she whispered softly and as it were
939987 [49887] breathlessly.
939987 [49888] 
939987 [49889] "Read! I want you to," he persisted. "You used to read to Lizaveta."
939987 [49890] 
939987 [49891] Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her
939987 [49892] voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the
939987 [49893] first syllable.
939987 [49894] 
939987 [49895] "Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany..." she forced
939987 [49896] herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an
939987 [49897] overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.
939987 [49898] 
939987 [49899] Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him
939987 [49900] and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on
939987 [49901] her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her
939987 [49902] to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these
939987 [49903] feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps
939987 [49904] for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy
939987 [49905] father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of
939987 [49906] starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same
939987 [49907] time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with
939987 [49908] dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read
939987 [49909] to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of
939987 [49910] it!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.
939987 [49911] She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on
939987 [49912] reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth
939987 [49913] verse:
939987 [49914] 
939987 [49915] "And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
939987 [49916] their brother.
939987 [49917] 
939987 [49918] "Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met
939987 [49919] Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
939987 [49920] 
939987 [49921] "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
939987 [49922] had not died.
939987 [49923] 
939987 [49924] "But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give
939987 [49925] it Thee...."
939987 [49926] 
939987 [49927] Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would
939987 [49928] quiver and break again.
939987 [49929] 
939987 [49930] "Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
939987 [49931] 
939987 [49932] "Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the
939987 [49933] resurrection, at the last day.
939987 [49934] 
939987 [49935] "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that
939987 [49936] believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.
939987 [49937] 
939987 [49938] "And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest
939987 [49939] thou this?
939987 [49940] 
939987 [49941] "She saith unto Him,"
939987 [49942] 
939987 [49943] (And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as
939987 [49944] though she were making a public confession of faith.)
939987 [49945] 
939987 [49946] "Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which
939987 [49947] should come into the world."
939987 [49948] 
939987 [49949] She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went
939987 [49950] on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and
939987 [49951] his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.
939987 [49952] 
939987 [49953] "Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at
939987 [49954] His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
939987 [49955] not died.
939987 [49956] 
939987 [49957] "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which
939987 [49958] came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,
939987 [49959] 
939987 [49960] "And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and
939987 [49961] see.
939987 [49962] 
939987 [49963] "Jesus wept.
939987 [49964] 
939987 [49965] "Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!
939987 [49966] 
939987 [49967] "And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the
939987 [49968] blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
939987 [49969] 
939987 [49970] Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!
939987 [49971] She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was
939987 [49972] getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense
939987 [49973] triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy
939987 [49974] gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she
939987 [49975] was reading by heart. At the last verse "Could not this Man which opened
939987 [49976] the eyes of the blind..." dropping her voice she passionately reproduced
939987 [49977] the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who
939987 [49978] in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by
939987 [49979] thunder, sobbing and believing.... "And _he, he_--too, is blinded and
939987 [49980] unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At
939987 [49981] once, now," was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy
939987 [49982] anticipation.
939987 [49983] 
939987 [49984] "Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a
939987 [49985] cave, and a stone lay upon it.
939987 [49986] 
939987 [49987] "Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was
939987 [49988] dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been
939987 [49989] dead four days."
939987 [49990] 
939987 [49991] She laid emphasis on the word _four_.
939987 [49992] 
939987 [49993] "Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
939987 [49994] believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
939987 [49995] 
939987 [49996] "Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
939987 [49997] And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou
939987 [49998] hast heard Me.
939987 [49999] 
939987 [50000] "And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
939987 [50001] stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
939987 [50002] 
939987 [50003] "And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
939987 [50004] forth.
939987 [50005] 
939987 [50006] "And he that was dead came forth."
939987 [50007] 
939987 [50008] (She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were
939987 [50009] seeing it before her eyes.)
939987 [50010] 
939987 [50011] "Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about
939987 [50012] with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.
939987 [50013] 
939987 [50014] "Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which
939987 [50015] Jesus did believed on Him."
939987 [50016] 
939987 [50017] She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair
939987 [50018] quickly.
939987 [50019] 
939987 [50020] "That is all about the raising of Lazarus," she whispered severely and
939987 [50021] abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise
939987 [50022] her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was
939987 [50023] flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the
939987 [50024] poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely
939987 [50025] been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.
939987 [50026] 
939987 [50027] "I came to speak of something," Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got
939987 [50028] up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face
939987 [50029] was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in
939987 [50030] it.
939987 [50031] 
939987 [50032] "I have abandoned my family to-day," he said, "my mother and sister. I
939987 [50033] am not going to see them. I've broken with them completely."
939987 [50034] 
939987 [50035] "What for?" asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and
939987 [50036] sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She
939987 [50037] heard his news almost with horror.
939987 [50038] 
939987 [50039] "I have only you now," he added. "Let us go together.... I've come to
939987 [50040] you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!"
939987 [50041] 
939987 [50042] His eyes glittered "as though he were mad," Sonia thought, in her turn.
939987 [50043] 
939987 [50044] "Go where?" she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.
939987 [50045] 
939987 [50046] "How do I know? I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothing
939987 [50047] more. It's the same goal!"
939987 [50048] 
939987 [50049] She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was
939987 [50050] terribly, infinitely unhappy.
939987 [50051] 
939987 [50052] "No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have
939987 [50053] understood. I need you, that is why I have come to you."
939987 [50054] 
939987 [50055] "I don't understand," whispered Sonia.
939987 [50056] 
939987 [50057] "You'll understand later. Haven't you done the same? You, too, have
939987 [50058] transgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid
939987 [50059] hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it's all the
939987 [50060] same!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'll
939987 [50061] end in the Hay Market.... But you won't be able to stand it, and if
939987 [50062] you remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad
939987 [50063] creature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!"
939987 [50064] 
939987 [50065] "What for? What's all this for?" said Sonia, strangely and violently
939987 [50066] agitated by his words.
939987 [50067] 
939987 [50068] "What for? Because you can't remain like this, that's why! You must look
939987 [50069] things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry
939987 [50070] that God won't allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken
939987 [50071] to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she'll soon
939987 [50072] die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to
939987 [50073] grief? Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent out
939987 [50074] by their mothers to beg? I've found out where those mothers live and in
939987 [50075] what surroundings. Children can't remain children there! At seven the
939987 [50076] child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of
939987 [50077] Christ: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.' He bade us honour and love
939987 [50078] them, they are the humanity of the future...."
939987 [50079] 
939987 [50080] "What's to be done, what's to be done?" repeated Sonia, weeping
939987 [50081] hysterically and wringing her hands.
939987 [50082] 
939987 [50083] "What's to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all,
939987 [50084] and take the suffering on oneself. What, you don't understand? You'll
939987 [50085] understand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all
939987 [50086] trembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That's the goal, remember
939987 [50087] that! That's my farewell message. Perhaps it's the last time I shall
939987 [50088] speak to you. If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and then
939987 [50089] remember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you'll
939987 [50090] understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I'll tell you
939987 [50091] who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye."
939987 [50092] 
939987 [50093] Sonia started with terror.
939987 [50094] 
939987 [50095] "Why, do you know who killed her?" she asked, chilled with horror,
939987 [50096] looking wildly at him.
939987 [50097] 
939987 [50098] "I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I'm not
939987 [50099] coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you
939987 [50100] out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when
939987 [50101] Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don't shake hands.
939987 [50102] To-morrow!"
939987 [50103] 
939987 [50104] He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like
939987 [50105] one insane and felt it. Her head was going round.
939987 [50106] 
939987 [50107] "Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those
939987 [50108] words mean? It's awful!" But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter
939987 [50109] her head, not for a moment! "Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has
939987 [50110] abandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And
939987 [50111] what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot
939987 [50112] and said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live
939987 [50113] without her.... Oh, merciful heavens!"
939987 [50114] 
939987 [50115] Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from
939987 [50116] time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish
939987 [50117] sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading
939987 [50118] the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing
939987 [50119] her feet, weeping.
939987 [50120] 
939987 [50121] On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's room
939987 [50122] from Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A
939987 [50123] card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the
939987 [50124] canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the
939987 [50125] room's being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had been
939987 [50126] standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went
939987 [50127] out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room
939987 [50128] which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it
939987 [50129] to the door that led to Sonia's room. The conversation had struck him
939987 [50130] as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so
939987 [50131] that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for
939987 [50132] instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but
939987 [50133] might listen in comfort.
939987 [50134] 
939987 [50135] 
939987 [50136] 
939987 [50137] CHAPTER V
939987 [50138] 
939987 [50139] When next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the
939987 [50140] department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in
939987 [50141] to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:
939987 [50142] it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected
939987 [50143] that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and
939987 [50144] people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually
939987 [50145] passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an
939987 [50146] office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had
939987 [50147] no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and
939987 [50148] suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some
939987 [50149] mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was
939987 [50150] nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty
939987 [50151] details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.
939987 [50152] He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him
939987 [50153] that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the
939987 [50154] earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait
939987 [50155] like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at
939987 [50156] eleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply
939987 [50157] he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)
939987 [50158] and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom
939987 [50159] exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture
939987 [50160] had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his
939987 [50161] alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh
939987 [50162] conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a
939987 [50163] rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at
939987 [50164] facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was
939987 [50165] meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred
939987 [50166] and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such
939987 [50167] that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and
939987 [50168] arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,
939987 [50169] to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained
939987 [50170] nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
939987 [50171] 
939987 [50172] He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room
939987 [50173] neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that
939987 [50174] stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a
939987 [50175] bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,
939987 [50176] of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,
939987 [50177] beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov's entrance
939987 [50178] Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in
939987 [50179] and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial
939987 [50180] and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that
939987 [50181] Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had
939987 [50182] been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.
939987 [50183] 
939987 [50184] "Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain"... began Porfiry,
939987 [50185] holding out both hands to him. "Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps
939987 [50186] you don't like to be called 'my dear fellow' and 'old man!'--_tout
939987 [50187] court_? Please don't think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa."
939987 [50188] 
939987 [50189] Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. "In our domain,"
939987 [50190] the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all
939987 [50191] characteristic signs.
939987 [50192] 
939987 [50193] "He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it
939987 [50194] back in time," struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,
939987 [50195] but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.
939987 [50196] 
939987 [50197] "I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all
939987 [50198] right or shall I copy it again?"
939987 [50199] 
939987 [50200] "What? A paper? Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's all right," Porfiry
939987 [50201] Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the
939987 [50202] paper and looked at it. "Yes, it's all right. Nothing more is needed,"
939987 [50203] he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.
939987 [50204] 
939987 [50205] A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the
939987 [50206] table and put it on his bureau.
939987 [50207] 
939987 [50208] "I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...
939987 [50209] formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?" Raskolnikov
939987 [50210] was beginning again. "Why did I put in 'I believe'" passed through
939987 [50211] his mind in a flash. "Why am I so uneasy at having put in that '_I
939987 [50212] believe_'?" came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his
939987 [50213] uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the
939987 [50214] first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that
939987 [50215] this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was
939987 [50216] increasing. "It's bad, it's bad! I shall say too much again."
939987 [50217] 
939987 [50218] "Yes, yes, yes! There's no hurry, there's no hurry," muttered Porfiry
939987 [50219] Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,
939987 [50220] as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,
939987 [50221] at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov's suspicious glance, then again
939987 [50222] standing still and looking him straight in the face.
939987 [50223] 
939987 [50224] His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling
939987 [50225] from one side to the other and rebounding back.
939987 [50226] 
939987 [50227] "We've plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a
939987 [50228] cigarette!" he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. "You know I am
939987 [50229] receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my
939987 [50230] government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to
939987 [50231] have some repairs done here. It's almost finished now.... Government
939987 [50232] quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?"
939987 [50233] 
939987 [50234] "Yes, a capital thing," answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost
939987 [50235] ironically.
939987 [50236] 
939987 [50237] "A capital thing, a capital thing," repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as
939987 [50238] though he had just thought of something quite different. "Yes, a capital
939987 [50239] thing," he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and
939987 [50240] stopping short two steps from him.
939987 [50241] 
939987 [50242] This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the
939987 [50243] serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.
939987 [50244] 
939987 [50245] But this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than ever and he could not
939987 [50246] resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.
939987 [50247] 
939987 [50248] "Tell me, please," he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him
939987 [50249] and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. "I believe it's a
939987 [50250] sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating
939987 [50251] lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least
939987 [50252] an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man
939987 [50253] they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to
939987 [50254] give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn't
939987 [50255] that so? It's a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals
939987 [50256] of the art?"
939987 [50257] 
939987 [50258] "Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
939987 [50259] quarters... eh?"
939987 [50260] 
939987 [50261] And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;
939987 [50262] a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his
939987 [50263] forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened
939987 [50264] and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all
939987 [50265] over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced
939987 [50266] himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,
939987 [50267] broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov's
939987 [50268] repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and
939987 [50269] stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his
939987 [50270] intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on
939987 [50271] both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in
939987 [50272] his visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with
939987 [50273] which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant
939987 [50274] in Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been
939987 [50275] embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps
939987 [50276] fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here
939987 [50277] unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in
939987 [50278] another moment would break upon him...
939987 [50279] 
939987 [50280] He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his
939987 [50281] cap.
939987 [50282] 
939987 [50283] "Porfiry Petrovitch," he began resolutely, though with considerable
939987 [50284] irritation, "yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you
939987 [50285] for some inquiries" (he laid special stress on the word "inquiries"). "I
939987 [50286] have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow
939987 [50287] me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral
939987 [50288] of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also," he added,
939987 [50289] feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at
939987 [50290] his anger. "I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It's
939987 [50291] partly what made me ill. In short," he shouted, feeling that the phrase
939987 [50292] about his illness was still more out of place, "in short, kindly examine
939987 [50293] me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the
939987 [50294] proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,
939987 [50295] good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now."
939987 [50296] 
939987 [50297] "Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?"
939987 [50298] cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off
939987 [50299] laughing. "Please don't disturb yourself," he began fidgeting from place
939987 [50300] to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. "There's no hurry,
939987 [50301] there's no hurry, it's all nonsense. Oh, no, I'm very glad you've come
939987 [50302] to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for
939987 [50303] my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion
939987 [50304] Romanovitch? That is your name?... It's my nerves, you tickled me
939987 [50305] so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with
939987 [50306] laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I'm
939987 [50307] often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I
939987 [50308] shall think you are angry..."
939987 [50309] 
939987 [50310] Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning
939987 [50311] angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.
939987 [50312] 
939987 [50313] "I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,"
939987 [50314] Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding
939987 [50315] his visitor's eyes. "You see, I'm a bachelor, a man of no consequence
939987 [50316] and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I'm set, I'm
939987 [50317] running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in
939987 [50318] our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but
939987 [50319] respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before
939987 [50320] they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit
939987 [50321] opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of
939987 [50322] conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have
939987 [50323] their subjects of conversation, _c'est de rigueur_, but people of the
939987 [50324] middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied
939987 [50325] and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public
939987 [50326] interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don't want to deceive one
939987 [50327] another, I don't know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it
939987 [50328] looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so
939987 [50329] delighted..."
939987 [50330] 
939987 [50331] Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with
939987 [50332] a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry
939987 [50333] Petrovitch. "Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly
939987 [50334] babble?"
939987 [50335] 
939987 [50336] "I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a
939987 [50337] friend?" Porfiry pattered on, "and you know all these official
939987 [50338] duties... please don't mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear
939987 [50339] fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is
939987 [50340] absolutely indispensable for me. I'm always sitting and so glad to be
939987 [50341] moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I
939987 [50342] always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,
939987 [50343] even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have
939987 [50344] it, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries
939987 [50345] and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...
939987 [50346] I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for
939987 [50347] the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation
939987 [50348] yourself just now very aptly and wittily." (Raskolnikov had made no
939987 [50349] observation of the kind.) "One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One
939987 [50350] keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and
939987 [50351] we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for
939987 [50352] our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree
939987 [50353] with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that
939987 [50354] they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily
939987 [50355] put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous
939987 [50356] comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by 'government
939987 [50357] quarters'... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won't go on! Ah,
939987 [50358] by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just
939987 [50359] now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what's the use of formality?
939987 [50360] In many cases it's nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets
939987 [50361] a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow
939987 [50362] me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining
939987 [50363] lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of
939987 [50364] investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!"
939987 [50365] 
939987 [50366] Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on
939987 [50367] uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again
939987 [50368] reverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving
939987 [50369] his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his
939987 [50370] right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations
939987 [50371] that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov
939987 [50372] suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop
939987 [50373] for a moment near the door, as though he were listening.
939987 [50374] 
939987 [50375] "Is he expecting anything?"
939987 [50376] 
939987 [50377] "You are certainly quite right about it," Porfiry began gaily, looking
939987 [50378] with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and
939987 [50379] instantly put him on his guard); "certainly quite right in laughing so
939987 [50380] wittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological
939987 [50381] methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres
939987 [50382] too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if
939987 [50383] I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to
939987 [50384] be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you're reading for the law,
939987 [50385] of course, Rodion Romanovitch?"
939987 [50386] 
939987 [50387] "Yes, I was..."
939987 [50388] 
939987 [50389] "Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don't
939987 [50390] suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish
939987 [50391] about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I
939987 [50392] took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him
939987 [50393] prematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may
939987 [50394] be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in
939987 [50395] quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn't I let him walk
939987 [50396] about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don't quite understand, so
939987 [50397] I'll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I
939987 [50398] may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You're
939987 [50399] laughing?"
939987 [50400] 
939987 [50401] Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed
939987 [50402] lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's.
939987 [50403] 
939987 [50404] "Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so
939987 [50405] different. You say 'evidence'. Well, there may be evidence. But
939987 [50406] evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining
939987 [50407] lawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so
939987 [50408] to say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence
939987 [50409] such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
939987 [50410] And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_
939987 [50411] was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of
939987 [50412] getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to
939987 [50413] speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his
939987 [50414] mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at
939987 [50415] Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright
939987 [50416] that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when
939987 [50417] they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,
939987 [50418] I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at
939987 [50419] least. You're laughing, you don't believe me again? Of course, you're
939987 [50420] right, too. You're right, you're right. These are special cases, I
939987 [50421] admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the
939987 [50422] general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,
939987 [50423] for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at
939987 [50424] all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon
939987 [50425] as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and
939987 [50426] sometimes a case unlike any that's gone before. Very comic cases of that
939987 [50427] sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don't touch
939987 [50428] him and don't worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every
939987 [50429] moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and
939987 [50430] if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he'll be bound to lose his
939987 [50431] head. He'll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as
939987 [50432] plain as twice two are four--it's delightful. It may be so with a simple
939987 [50433] peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a
939987 [50434] certain side, it's a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it's a very
939987 [50435] important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then
939987 [50436] there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they
939987 [50437] are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer
939987 [50438] from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it's
939987 [50439] no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk
939987 [50440] about for a bit! I know well enough that I've caught him and that he
939987 [50441] won't escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A
939987 [50442] Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching
939987 [50443] and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country
939987 [50444] perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.
939987 [50445] A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such
939987 [50446] strangers as our peasants. He-he! But that's all nonsense, and on
939987 [50447] the surface. It's not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is
939987 [50448] _psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!
939987 [50449] Through a law of nature he can't escape me if he had anywhere to go.
939987 [50450] Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That's how he will keep
939987 [50451] circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He'll
939987 [50452] begin to brood, he'll weave a tangle round himself, he'll worry himself
939987 [50453] to death! What's more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I
939987 [50454] only give him long enough interval.... And he'll keep circling round
939987 [50455] me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He'll fly straight into my
939987 [50456] mouth and I'll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You
939987 [50457] don't believe me?"
939987 [50458] 
939987 [50459] Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with
939987 [50460] the same intensity into Porfiry's face.
939987 [50461] 
939987 [50462] "It's a lesson," he thought, turning cold. "This is beyond the cat
939987 [50463] playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He can't be showing off his power
939987 [50464] with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must
939987 [50465] have another object. What is it? It's all nonsense, my friend, you are
939987 [50466] pretending, to scare me! You've no proofs and the man I saw had no
939987 [50467] real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up
939987 [50468] beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won't do it! But
939987 [50469] why give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my
939987 [50470] friend, you are wrong, you won't do it even though you have some trap
939987 [50471] for me... let us see what you have in store for me."
939987 [50472] 
939987 [50473] And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times
939987 [50474] he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he
939987 [50475] dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked
939987 [50476] with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to
939987 [50477] speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best
939987 [50478] policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be
939987 [50479] irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too
939987 [50480] freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.
939987 [50481] 
939987 [50482] "No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke
939987 [50483] on you," Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling
939987 [50484] at every instant and again pacing round the room. "And to be sure you're
939987 [50485] right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in
939987 [50486] other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse
939987 [50487] an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to
939987 [50488] say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like
939987 [50489] all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and
939987 [50490] that's for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as
939987 [50491] far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beaten
939987 [50492] Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it
939987 [50493] all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered
939987 [50494] with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are
939987 [50495] laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!
939987 [50496] But I can't help it, it's my weakness. I am fond of military science.
939987 [50497] And I'm ever so fond of reading all military histories. I've certainly
939987 [50498] missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my
939987 [50499] word I ought. I shouldn't have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a
939987 [50500] major, he-he! Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about
939987 [50501] this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man's temperament, my
939987 [50502] dear sir, are weighty matters and it's astonishing how they sometimes
939987 [50503] deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking
939987 [50504] seriously, Rodion Romanovitch" (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who
939987 [50505] was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even
939987 [50506] his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) "Moreover, I'm
939987 [50507] a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I
939987 [50508] really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don't even expect a
939987 [50509] reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid
939987 [50510] thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of
939987 [50511] life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a
939987 [50512] poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he's liable
939987 [50513] to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after
939987 [50514] all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal's temperament, worse
939987 [50515] luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don't think
939987 [50516] of that 'when they overstep all obstacles,' as you wittily and cleverly
939987 [50517] expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special
939987 [50518] case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;
939987 [50519] you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at
939987 [50520] the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course
939987 [50521] there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he's
939987 [50522] given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn't reckon on his
939987 [50523] temperament. That's what betrays him! Another time he will be carried
939987 [50524] away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he
939987 [50525] will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will
939987 [50526] be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us
939987 [50527] an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think
939987 [50528] differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like
939987 [50529] that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,
939987 [50530] speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of
939987 [50531] allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn't you take me long
939987 [50532] ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,
939987 [50533] the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything
939987 [50534] like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so
939987 [50535] pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?"
939987 [50536] 
939987 [50537] "Oh, don't trouble, please," cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke
939987 [50538] into a laugh. "Please don't trouble."
939987 [50539] 
939987 [50540] Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.
939987 [50541] Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical
939987 [50542] laughter.
939987 [50543] 
939987 [50544] "Porfiry Petrovitch," he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though
939987 [50545] his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. "I see clearly at last
939987 [50546] that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister
939987 [50547] Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you
939987 [50548] find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then
939987 [50549] prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my
939987 [50550] face and worried..."
939987 [50551] 
939987 [50552] His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain
939987 [50553] his voice.
939987 [50554] 
939987 [50555] "I won't allow it!" he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. "Do
939987 [50556] you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won't allow it."
939987 [50557] 
939987 [50558] "Good heavens! What does it mean?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently
939987 [50559] quite frightened. "Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the
939987 [50560] matter with you?"
939987 [50561] 
939987 [50562] "I won't allow it," Raskolnikov shouted again.
939987 [50563] 
939987 [50564] "Hush, my dear man! They'll hear and come in. Just think, what could we
939987 [50565] say to them?" Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face
939987 [50566] close to Raskolnikov's.
939987 [50567] 
939987 [50568] "I won't allow it, I won't allow it," Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,
939987 [50569] but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.
939987 [50570] 
939987 [50571] Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
939987 [50572] 
939987 [50573] "Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You're
939987 [50574] ill!" and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a
939987 [50575] decanter of water in the corner. "Come, drink a little," he whispered,
939987 [50576] rushing up to him with the decanter. "It will be sure to do you good."
939987 [50577] 
939987 [50578] Porfiry Petrovitch's alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov
939987 [50579] was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take
939987 [50580] the water, however.
939987 [50581] 
939987 [50582] "Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you'll drive yourself out of your
939987 [50583] mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little."
939987 [50584] 
939987 [50585] He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to
939987 [50586] his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.
939987 [50587] 
939987 [50588] "Yes, you've had a little attack! You'll bring back your illness again,
939987 [50589] my dear fellow," Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,
939987 [50590] though he still looked rather disconcerted. "Good heavens, you must
939987 [50591] take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me
939987 [50592] yesterday--I know, I know, I've a nasty, ironical temper, but what they
939987 [50593] made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you'd been. We
939987 [50594] dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands
939987 [50595] in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy's sake, sit
939987 [50596] down!"
939987 [50597] 
939987 [50598] "No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,"
939987 [50599] Raskolnikov answered sharply.
939987 [50600] 
939987 [50601] "You knew?"
939987 [50602] 
939987 [50603] "I knew. What of it?"
939987 [50604] 
939987 [50605] "Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;
939987 [50606] I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night
939987 [50607] when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so
939987 [50608] that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I
939987 [50609] understand your state of mind at that time... but you'll drive yourself
939987 [50610] mad like that, upon my word! You'll lose your head! You're full of
939987 [50611] generous indignation at the wrongs you've received, first from destiny,
939987 [50612] and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to
939987 [50613] another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because
939987 [50614] you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That's so, isn't
939987 [50615] it? I have guessed how you feel, haven't I? Only in that way you'll
939987 [50616] lose your head and Razumihin's, too; he's too _good_ a man for such
939987 [50617] a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your
939987 [50618] illness is infectious for him... I'll tell you about it when you are
939987 [50619] more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness' sake. Please rest, you
939987 [50620] look shocking, do sit down."
939987 [50621] 
939987 [50622] Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In
939987 [50623] amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who
939987 [50624] still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.
939987 [50625] But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange
939987 [50626] inclination to believe. Porfiry's unexpected words about the flat had
939987 [50627] utterly overwhelmed him. "How can it be, he knows about the flat then,"
939987 [50628] he thought suddenly, "and he tells it me himself!"
939987 [50629] 
939987 [50630] "Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a
939987 [50631] case of morbid psychology," Porfiry went on quickly. "A man confessed to
939987 [50632] murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought
939987 [50633] forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but
939987 [50634] only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that
939987 [50635] he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it
939987 [50636] got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he
939987 [50637] persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court
939987 [50638] of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under
939987 [50639] proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear
939987 [50640] fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse
939987 [50641] to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about
939987 [50642] blood! I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man
939987 [50643] is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the
939987 [50644] same with bell-ringing.... It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You
939987 [50645] have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced
939987 [50646] doctor, what's the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You
939987 [50647] were delirious when you did all this!"
939987 [50648] 
939987 [50649] For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.
939987 [50650] 
939987 [50651] "Is it possible, is it possible," flashed through his mind, "that he is
939987 [50652] still lying? He can't be, he can't be." He rejected that idea, feeling
939987 [50653] to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury
939987 [50654] might drive him mad.
939987 [50655] 
939987 [50656] "I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing," he cried, straining
939987 [50657] every faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game, "I was quite myself, do you
939987 [50658] hear?"
939987 [50659] 
939987 [50660] "Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,
939987 [50661] you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell
939987 [50662] me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were
939987 [50663] actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,
939987 [50664] would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession
939987 [50665] of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be
939987 [50666] possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on
939987 [50667] your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
939987 [50668] That's so, isn't it?"
939987 [50669] 
939987 [50670] There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on
939987 [50671] the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at
939987 [50672] him.
939987 [50673] 
939987 [50674] "Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he
939987 [50675] came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don't
939987 [50676] conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation."
939987 [50677] 
939987 [50678] Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.
939987 [50679] 
939987 [50680] "You keep telling lies," he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips
939987 [50681] into a sickly smile, "you are trying again to show that you know all
939987 [50682] my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand," he said, conscious
939987 [50683] himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. "You want to
939987 [50684] frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me..."
939987 [50685] 
939987 [50686] He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of
939987 [50687] intense hatred in his eyes.
939987 [50688] 
939987 [50689] "You keep lying," he said. "You know perfectly well that the best
939987 [50690] policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to
939987 [50691] conceal as little as possible. I don't believe you!"
939987 [50692] 
939987 [50693] "What a wily person you are!" Porfiry tittered, "there's no catching
939987 [50694] you; you've a perfect monomania. So you don't believe me? But still you
939987 [50695] do believe me, you believe a quarter; I'll soon make you believe the
939987 [50696] whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you
939987 [50697] good."
939987 [50698] 
939987 [50699] Raskolnikov's lips trembled.
939987 [50700] 
939987 [50701] "Yes, I do," went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov's arm genially, "you
939987 [50702] must take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here
939987 [50703] now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do
939987 [50704] nothing but frighten them..."
939987 [50705] 
939987 [50706] "What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of
939987 [50707] yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?"
939987 [50708] 
939987 [50709] "Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don't
939987 [50710] notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From
939987 [50711] Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,
939987 [50712] you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your
939987 [50713] suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return
939987 [50714] to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a
939987 [50715] precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),
939987 [50716] and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,
939987 [50717] should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your
939987 [50718] suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted
939987 [50719] your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your
939987 [50720] expression) saying: 'And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or
939987 [50721] nearly eleven at the murdered woman's flat and why did you ring the bell
939987 [50722] and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters
939987 [50723] to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?' That's how
939987 [50724] I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to
939987 [50725] have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps
939987 [50726] have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have
939987 [50727] not done that! But you can't look at it normally and you see nothing, I
939987 [50728] say again."
939987 [50729] 
939987 [50730] Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to
939987 [50731] perceive it.
939987 [50732] 
939987 [50733] "You are lying all the while," he cried, "I don't know your object,
939987 [50734] but you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be
939987 [50735] mistaken!"
939987 [50736] 
939987 [50737] "I am lying?" Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving
939987 [50738] a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least
939987 [50739] concerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him. "I am lying... but how did
939987 [50740] I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving
939987 [50741] you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,
939987 [50742] melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!
939987 [50743] Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very
939987 [50744] reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don't remember--that's
939987 [50745] all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium
939987 [50746] were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There
939987 [50747] may have been others, eh? He-he-he!"
939987 [50748] 
939987 [50749] Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.
939987 [50750] 
939987 [50751] "Briefly," he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so
939987 [50752] doing pushing Porfiry back a little, "briefly, I want to know, do you
939987 [50753] acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry
939987 [50754] Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!"
939987 [50755] 
939987 [50756] "What a business I'm having with you!" cried Porfiry with a perfectly
939987 [50757] good-humoured, sly and composed face. "And why do you want to know, why
939987 [50758] do you want to know so much, since they haven't begun to worry you? Why,
939987 [50759] you are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why
939987 [50760] do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!"
939987 [50761] 
939987 [50762] "I repeat," Raskolnikov cried furiously, "that I can't put up with it!"
939987 [50763] 
939987 [50764] "With what? Uncertainty?" interrupted Porfiry.
939987 [50765] 
939987 [50766] "Don't jeer at me! I won't have it! I tell you I won't have it. I can't
939987 [50767] and I won't, do you hear, do you hear?" he shouted, bringing his fist
939987 [50768] down on the table again.
939987 [50769] 
939987 [50770] "Hush! Hush! They'll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of
939987 [50771] yourself. I am not joking," Porfiry whispered, but this time there was
939987 [50772] not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now
939987 [50773] he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all
939987 [50774] mystification.
939987 [50775] 
939987 [50776] But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell
939987 [50777] into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to
939987 [50778] speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
939987 [50779] 
939987 [50780] "I will not allow myself to be tortured," he whispered, instantly
939987 [50781] recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and
939987 [50782] driven to even greater fury by the thought. "Arrest me, search me, but
939987 [50783] kindly act in due form and don't play with me! Don't dare!"
939987 [50784] 
939987 [50785] "Don't worry about the form," Porfiry interrupted with the same sly
939987 [50786] smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. "I invited
939987 [50787] you to see me quite in a friendly way."
939987 [50788] 
939987 [50789] "I don't want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,
939987 [50790] I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?"
939987 [50791] 
939987 [50792] He took up his cap and went to the door.
939987 [50793] 
939987 [50794] "And won't you see my little surprise?" chuckled Porfiry, again taking
939987 [50795] him by the arm and stopping him at the door.
939987 [50796] 
939987 [50797] He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened
939987 [50798] Raskolnikov.
939987 [50799] 
939987 [50800] "What surprise?" he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in
939987 [50801] alarm.
939987 [50802] 
939987 [50803] "My little surprise, it's sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!"
939987 [50804] (He pointed to the locked door.) "I locked him in that he should not
939987 [50805] escape."
939987 [50806] 
939987 [50807] "What is it? Where? What?..."
939987 [50808] 
939987 [50809] Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was
939987 [50810] locked.
939987 [50811] 
939987 [50812] "It's locked, here is the key!"
939987 [50813] 
939987 [50814] And he brought a key out of his pocket.
939987 [50815] 
939987 [50816] "You are lying," roared Raskolnikov without restraint, "you lie, you
939987 [50817] damned punchinello!" and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other
939987 [50818] door, not at all alarmed.
939987 [50819] 
939987 [50820] "I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray
939987 [50821] myself to you..."
939987 [50822] 
939987 [50823] "Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion
939987 [50824] Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don't shout, I shall call the
939987 [50825] clerks."
939987 [50826] 
939987 [50827] "You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work
939987 [50828] me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce
939987 [50829] your facts! I understand it all. You've no evidence, you have only
939987 [50830] wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov's! You knew my character, you
939987 [50831] wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and
939987 [50832] deputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?
939987 [50833] Where are they? Produce them?"
939987 [50834] 
939987 [50835] "Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do
939987 [50836] so would not be acting in form as you say, you don't know the business,
939987 [50837] my dear fellow.... And there's no escaping form, as you see," Porfiry
939987 [50838] muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
939987 [50839] 
939987 [50840] "Ah, they're coming," cried Raskolnikov. "You've sent for them! You
939987 [50841] expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,
939987 [50842] what you like!... I am ready!"
939987 [50843] 
939987 [50844] But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected
939987 [50845] that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for
939987 [50846] such a conclusion to their interview.
939987 [50847] 
939987 [50848] 
939987 [50849] 
939987 [50850] CHAPTER VI
939987 [50851] 
939987 [50852] When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.
939987 [50853] 
939987 [50854] The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a
939987 [50855] little.
939987 [50856] 
939987 [50857] "What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. "Why, I gave orders..."
939987 [50858] 
939987 [50859] For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were
939987 [50860] several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing
939987 [50861] somebody back.
939987 [50862] 
939987 [50863] "What is it?" Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
939987 [50864] 
939987 [50865] "The prisoner Nikolay has been brought," someone answered.
939987 [50866] 
939987 [50867] "He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What's he doing here?
939987 [50868] How irregular!" cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.
939987 [50869] 
939987 [50870] "But he..." began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
939987 [50871] 
939987 [50872] Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave
939987 [50873] a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
939987 [50874] 
939987 [50875] This man's appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared
939987 [50876] straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined
939987 [50877] gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his
939987 [50878] face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were
939987 [50879] faintly twitching.
939987 [50880] 
939987 [50881] He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,
939987 [50882] slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom
939987 [50883] he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing
939987 [50884] him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.
939987 [50885] 
939987 [50886] Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them
939987 [50887] tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.
939987 [50888] 
939987 [50889] "Go away, it's too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you
939987 [50890] brought him so soon?" Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,
939987 [50891] and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.
939987 [50892] 
939987 [50893] But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
939987 [50894] 
939987 [50895] "What's the matter?" cried Porfiry, surprised.
939987 [50896] 
939987 [50897] "I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer," Nikolay articulated
939987 [50898] suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
939987 [50899] 
939987 [50900] For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;
939987 [50901] even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and
939987 [50902] stood immovable.
939987 [50903] 
939987 [50904] "What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary
939987 [50905] stupefaction.
939987 [50906] 
939987 [50907] "I... am the murderer," repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.
939987 [50908] 
939987 [50909] "What... you... what... whom did you kill?" Porfiry Petrovitch was
939987 [50910] obviously bewildered.
939987 [50911] 
939987 [50912] Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
939987 [50913] 
939987 [50914] "Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with
939987 [50915] an axe. Darkness came over me," he added suddenly, and was again silent.
939987 [50916] 
939987 [50917] He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some
939987 [50918] moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back
939987 [50919] the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.
939987 [50920] Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,
939987 [50921] staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,
939987 [50922] looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and
939987 [50923] seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
939987 [50924] 
939987 [50925] "You're in too great a hurry," he shouted at him, almost angrily. "I
939987 [50926] didn't ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?"
939987 [50927] 
939987 [50928] "I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence," Nikolay pronounced.
939987 [50929] 
939987 [50930] "Ach! What did you kill them with?"
939987 [50931] 
939987 [50932] "An axe. I had it ready."
939987 [50933] 
939987 [50934] "Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?"
939987 [50935] 
939987 [50936] Nikolay did not understand the question.
939987 [50937] 
939987 [50938] "Did you do it alone?"
939987 [50939] 
939987 [50940] "Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it."
939987 [50941] 
939987 [50942] "Don't be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs
939987 [50943] like that at the time? The porters met you both!"
939987 [50944] 
939987 [50945] "It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka," Nikolay replied
939987 [50946] hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.
939987 [50947] 
939987 [50948] "I knew it!" cried Porfiry, with vexation. "It's not his own tale he is
939987 [50949] telling," he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested
939987 [50950] on Raskolnikov again.
939987 [50951] 
939987 [50952] He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
939987 [50953] forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.
939987 [50954] 
939987 [50955] "My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!" he flew up to him, "this won't
939987 [50956] do; I'm afraid you must go... it's no good your staying... I will...
939987 [50957] you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!"
939987 [50958] 
939987 [50959] And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
939987 [50960] 
939987 [50961] "I suppose you didn't expect it?" said Raskolnikov who, though he had
939987 [50962] not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.
939987 [50963] 
939987 [50964] "You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is
939987 [50965] trembling! He-he!"
939987 [50966] 
939987 [50967] "You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!"
939987 [50968] 
939987 [50969] "Yes, I am; I didn't expect it."
939987 [50970] 
939987 [50971] They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to
939987 [50972] be gone.
939987 [50973] 
939987 [50974] "And your little surprise, aren't you going to show it to me?"
939987 [50975] Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
939987 [50976] 
939987 [50977] "Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical
939987 [50978] person! Come, till we meet!"
939987 [50979] 
939987 [50980] "I believe we can say _good-bye_!"
939987 [50981] 
939987 [50982] "That's in God's hands," muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.
939987 [50983] 
939987 [50984] As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people
939987 [50985] were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,
939987 [50986] whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there
939987 [50987] waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of
939987 [50988] Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running
939987 [50989] after him, out of breath.
939987 [50990] 
939987 [50991] "One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it's in God's hands,
939987 [50992] but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask
939987 [50993] you... so we shall meet again, shan't we?"
939987 [50994] 
939987 [50995] And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
939987 [50996] 
939987 [50997] "Shan't we?" he added again.
939987 [50998] 
939987 [50999] He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.
939987 [51000] 
939987 [51001] "You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I
939987 [51002] lost my temper," began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage
939987 [51003] that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.
939987 [51004] 
939987 [51005] "Don't mention it, don't mention it," Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.
939987 [51006] "I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet
939987 [51007] again. If it's God's will, we may see a great deal of one another."
939987 [51008] 
939987 [51009] "And will get to know each other through and through?" added
939987 [51010] Raskolnikov.
939987 [51011] 
939987 [51012] "Yes; know each other through and through," assented Porfiry Petrovitch,
939987 [51013] and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. "Now
939987 [51014] you're going to a birthday party?"
939987 [51015] 
939987 [51016] "To a funeral."
939987 [51017] 
939987 [51018] "Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well."
939987 [51019] 
939987 [51020] "I don't know what to wish you," said Raskolnikov, who had begun to
939987 [51021] descend the stairs, but looked back again. "I should like to wish you
939987 [51022] success, but your office is such a comical one."
939987 [51023] 
939987 [51024] "Why comical?" Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to
939987 [51025] prick up his ears at this.
939987 [51026] 
939987 [51027] "Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay
939987 [51028] psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have
939987 [51029] been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and
939987 [51030] now that he has confessed, you'll begin vivisecting him again. 'You are
939987 [51031] lying,' you'll say. 'You are not the murderer! You can't be! It's not
939987 [51032] your own tale you are telling!' You must admit it's a comical business!"
939987 [51033] 
939987 [51034] "He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was
939987 [51035] not his own tale he was telling?"
939987 [51036] 
939987 [51037] "How could I help noticing it!"
939987 [51038] 
939987 [51039] "He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You've really a
939987 [51040] playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say
939987 [51041] that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers."
939987 [51042] 
939987 [51043] "Yes, of Gogol."
939987 [51044] 
939987 [51045] "Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you."
939987 [51046] 
939987 [51047] "So shall I."
939987 [51048] 
939987 [51049] Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that
939987 [51050] on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to
939987 [51051] collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he
939987 [51052] was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,
939987 [51053] amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay's confession
939987 [51054] was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at
939987 [51055] once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they
939987 [51056] would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do
939987 [51057] something for himself, for the danger was imminent.
939987 [51058] 
939987 [51059] But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.
939987 [51060] Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with
939987 [51061] Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,
939987 [51062] he did not yet know all Porfiry's aims, he could not see into all his
939987 [51063] calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew
939987 [51064] better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry's "lead" had been for
939987 [51065] him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,
939987 [51066] circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first
939987 [51067] glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was
939987 [51068] bound to win. There's no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised
939987 [51069] himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was
939987 [51070] nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn't
939987 [51071] he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some
939987 [51072] surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting
939987 [51073] something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the
939987 [51074] unexpected appearance of Nikolay?
939987 [51075] 
939987 [51076] Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked
939987 [51077] something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his
939987 [51078] sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was
939987 [51079] that "surprise"? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have
939987 [51080] concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His
939987 [51081] yesterday's visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If
939987 [51082] Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....
939987 [51083] 
939987 [51084] He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in
939987 [51085] his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his
939987 [51086] cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.
939987 [51087] 
939987 [51088] He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might
939987 [51089] consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he
939987 [51090] wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna's. He would be too late for
939987 [51091] the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,
939987 [51092] and there at once he would see Sonia.
939987 [51093] 
939987 [51094] He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a
939987 [51095] moment on to his lips.
939987 [51096] 
939987 [51097] "To-day! To-day," he repeated to himself. "Yes, to-day! So it must
939987 [51098] be...."
939987 [51099] 
939987 [51100] But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He
939987 [51101] started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there
939987 [51102] suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday's visitor _from underground_.
939987 [51103] 
939987 [51104] The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,
939987 [51105] and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as
939987 [51106] yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change
939987 [51107] in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put
939987 [51108] his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have
939987 [51109] looked exactly like a peasant woman.
939987 [51110] 
939987 [51111] "What do you want?" asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was
939987 [51112] still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching
939987 [51113] it with his finger.
939987 [51114] 
939987 [51115] "What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.
939987 [51116] 
939987 [51117] "I have sinned," the man articulated softly.
939987 [51118] 
939987 [51119] "How?"
939987 [51120] 
939987 [51121] "By evil thoughts."
939987 [51122] 
939987 [51123] They looked at one another.
939987 [51124] 
939987 [51125] "I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go
939987 [51126] to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they
939987 [51127] let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my
939987 [51128] sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for
939987 [51129] you...."
939987 [51130] 
939987 [51131] "Who came?" Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.
939987 [51132] 
939987 [51133] "I did, I've wronged you."
939987 [51134] 
939987 [51135] "Then you come from that house?"
939987 [51136] 
939987 [51137] "I was standing at the gate with them... don't you remember? We have
939987 [51138] carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare
939987 [51139] hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed...."
939987 [51140] 
939987 [51141] And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came
939987 [51142] clearly before Raskolnikov's mind; he recollected that there had
939987 [51143] been several people there besides the porters, women among them.
939987 [51144] He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
939987 [51145] police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even
939987 [51146] now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round
939987 [51147] and made him some answer....
939987 [51148] 
939987 [51149] So this was the solution of yesterday's horror. The most awful thought
939987 [51150] was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself
939987 [51151] on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell
939987 [51152] nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So
939987 [51153] Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this
939987 [51154] _psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more
939987 [51155] facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then
939987 [51156] what can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest
939987 [51157] him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not
939987 [51158] known about it before.
939987 [51159] 
939987 [51160] "Was it you who told Porfiry... that I'd been there?" he cried, struck
939987 [51161] by a sudden idea.
939987 [51162] 
939987 [51163] "What Porfiry?"
939987 [51164] 
939987 [51165] "The head of the detective department?"
939987 [51166] 
939987 [51167] "Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went."
939987 [51168] 
939987 [51169] "To-day?"
939987 [51170] 
939987 [51171] "I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he
939987 [51172] worried you."
939987 [51173] 
939987 [51174] "Where? What? When?"
939987 [51175] 
939987 [51176] "Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time."
939987 [51177] 
939987 [51178] "What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my
939987 [51179] word!"
939987 [51180] 
939987 [51181] "I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said," began the man;
939987 [51182] "for it's too late, said they, and maybe he'll be angry that we did not
939987 [51183] come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making
939987 [51184] inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The
939987 [51185] first time I went he wasn't there, when I came an hour later he couldn't
939987 [51186] see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of
939987 [51187] everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room
939987 [51188] and punching himself on the chest. 'What do you scoundrels mean by it?
939987 [51189] If I'd known about it I should have arrested him!' Then he ran out,
939987 [51190] called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned
939987 [51191] to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I
939987 [51192] told him everything, and I told him that you didn't dare to say a word
939987 [51193] in answer to me yesterday and that you didn't recognise me. And he
939987 [51194] fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and
939987 [51195] getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told
939987 [51196] me to go into the next room. 'Sit there a bit,' he said. 'Don't move,
939987 [51197] whatever you may hear.' And he set a chair there for me and locked
939987 [51198] me in. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'I may call you.' And when Nikolay'd been
939987 [51199] brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. 'I shall send for you
939987 [51200] again and question you,' he said."
939987 [51201] 
939987 [51202] "And did he question Nikolay while you were there?"
939987 [51203] 
939987 [51204] "He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay."
939987 [51205] 
939987 [51206] The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground
939987 [51207] with his finger.
939987 [51208] 
939987 [51209] "Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander."
939987 [51210] 
939987 [51211] "May God forgive you," answered Raskolnikov.
939987 [51212] 
939987 [51213] And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,
939987 [51214] turned slowly and went out of the room.
939987 [51215] 
939987 [51216] "It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways," repeated
939987 [51217] Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.
939987 [51218] 
939987 [51219] "Now we'll make a fight for it," he said, with a malicious smile, as he
939987 [51220] went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and
939987 [51221] contempt he recollected his "cowardice."
939987 [51222] 
939987 [51223] 
939987 [51224]

939987 [51227] 
939987 [51228] 
939987 [51229] 
939987 [51230] CHAPTER I
939987 [51231] 
939987 [51232] The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and
939987 [51233] her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.
939987 [51234] Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept
939987 [51235] as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before
939987 [51236] fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been
939987 [51237] gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [51238] immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had
939987 [51239] jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at
939987 [51240] his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of
939987 [51241] late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the
939987 [51242] conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better
939987 [51243] one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned
939987 [51244] aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey
939987 [51245] Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.
939987 [51246] That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his
939987 [51247] young friend's account. He had set down a good many points against him
939987 [51248] of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to
939987 [51249] have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday's interview.
939987 [51250] That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness
939987 [51251] and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness
939987 [51252] followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case
939987 [51253] in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat
939987 [51254] which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being
939987 [51255] redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,
939987 [51256] would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just
939987 [51257] been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr
939987 [51258] Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In
939987 [51259] the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the
939987 [51260] instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the
939987 [51261] flat.
939987 [51262] 
939987 [51263] "Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?" Pyotr
939987 [51264] Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a
939987 [51265] gleam of desperate hope. "Can all that be really so irrevocably over?
939987 [51266] Is it no use to make another effort?" The thought of Dounia sent a
939987 [51267] voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,
939987 [51268] and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,
939987 [51269] Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
939987 [51270] 
939987 [51271] "It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money," he thought, as
939987 [51272] he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov's room, "and why on earth was I
939987 [51273] such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny
939987 [51274] so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!
939987 [51275] foo! If I'd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau
939987 [51276] and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and
939987 [51277] all that sort of trash from Knopp's and the English shop, my position
939987 [51278] would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me
939987 [51279] so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return
939987 [51280] money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to
939987 [51281] do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man
939987 [51282] who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H'm! I've made a
939987 [51283] blunder."
939987 [51284] 
939987 [51285] And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a
939987 [51286] fool--but not aloud, of course.
939987 [51287] 
939987 [51288] He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The
939987 [51289] preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna's excited
939987 [51290] his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he
939987 [51291] fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares
939987 [51292] he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
939987 [51293] laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he
939987 [51294] heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the
939987 [51295] lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead
939987 [51296] man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
939987 [51297] his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,
939987 [51298] was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most
939987 [51299] important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with
939987 [51300] great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was
939987 [51301] very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;
939987 [51302] she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she
939987 [51303] was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he
939987 [51304] went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov's, somewhat thoughtful. He
939987 [51305] had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.
939987 [51306] 
939987 [51307] Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of
939987 [51308] Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.
939987 [51309] Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay
939987 [51310] with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He
939987 [51311] had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from
939987 [51312] parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard
939987 [51313] of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young
939987 [51314] progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting
939987 [51315] circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had
939987 [51316] impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who
939987 [51317] despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a
939987 [51318] peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form
939987 [51319] even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had
939987 [51320] heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some
939987 [51321] sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and
939987 [51322] distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for
939987 [51323] many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown
939987 [51324] up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the
939987 [51325] thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of
939987 [51326] this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,
939987 [51327] when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases
939987 [51328] in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,
939987 [51329] had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal
939987 [51330] for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious
939987 [51331] trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the
939987 [51332] subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to
939987 [51333] anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of "our younger
939987 [51334] generation." He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before
939987 [51335] his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current
939987 [51336] phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace
939987 [51337] simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he
939987 [51338] had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it
939987 [51339] would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the
939987 [51340] systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for
939987 [51341] him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what
939987 [51342] was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything
939987 [51343] to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what
939987 [51344] precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up
939987 [51345] to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the
939987 [51346] thing to do or not? Couldn't he gain something through them? In fact
939987 [51347] hundreds of questions presented themselves.
939987 [51348] 
939987 [51349] Andrey Semyonovitch was an anÃ¦mic, scrofulous little man, with strangely
939987 [51350] flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk
939987 [51351] and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather
939987 [51352] soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in
939987 [51353] speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.
939987 [51354] He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did
939987 [51355] not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch
939987 [51356] really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress
939987 [51357] and "our younger generation" from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous
939987 [51358] and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,
939987 [51359] half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in
939987 [51360] fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,
939987 [51361] however sincerely.
939987 [51362] 
939987 [51363] Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to
939987 [51364] dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.
939987 [51365] However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr
939987 [51366] Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that "he was
939987 [51367] not the right sort of man." He had tried expounding to him the system of
939987 [51368] Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to
939987 [51369] listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun
939987 [51370] instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace
939987 [51371] simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of
939987 [51372] any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up
939987 [51373] third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own
939987 [51374] work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he
939987 [51375] would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr
939987 [51376] Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest
939987 [51377] praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,
939987 [51378] when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to
939987 [51379] the establishment of the new "commune," or to abstain from christening
939987 [51380] his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a
939987 [51381] month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing
939987 [51382] his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were
939987 [51383] attributed to him.
939987 [51384] 
939987 [51385] Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some
939987 [51386] five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over
939987 [51387] bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money
939987 [51388] walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank
939987 [51389] notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced
939987 [51390] Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money
939987 [51391] unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr
939987 [51392] Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and
939987 [51393] was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by
939987 [51394] reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.
939987 [51395] 
939987 [51396] He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey
939987 [51397] Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation
939987 [51398] of a new special "commune." The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr
939987 [51399] Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame
939987 [51400] betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the "humane" Andrey
939987 [51401] Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch's ill-humour to his recent breach
939987 [51402] with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that
939987 [51403] theme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which
939987 [51404] might console his worthy friend and "could not fail" to promote his
939987 [51405] development.
939987 [51406] 
939987 [51407] "There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the
939987 [51408] widow's, isn't there?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting
939987 [51409] Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.
939987 [51410] 
939987 [51411] "Why, don't you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think
939987 [51412] about all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were
939987 [51413] talking to her yesterday..."
939987 [51414] 
939987 [51415] "I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on
939987 [51416] this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I
939987 [51417] was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the
939987 [51418] wines! Several people are invited. It's beyond everything!" continued
939987 [51419] Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the
939987 [51420] conversation. "What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don't
939987 [51421] remember. But I shan't go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in
939987 [51422] passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year's salary as
939987 [51423] a destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on
939987 [51424] that account, hasn't she? He-he-he!"
939987 [51425] 
939987 [51426] "I don't intend to go either," said Lebeziatnikov.
939987 [51427] 
939987 [51428] "I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well
939987 [51429] hesitate, he-he!"
939987 [51430] 
939987 [51431] "Who thrashed? Whom?" cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.
939987 [51432] 
939987 [51433] "Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so
939987 [51434] yesterday... so that's what your convictions amount to... and the woman
939987 [51435] question, too, wasn't quite sound, he-he-he!" and Pyotr Petrovitch, as
939987 [51436] though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.
939987 [51437] 
939987 [51438] "It's all slander and nonsense!" cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always
939987 [51439] afraid of allusions to the subject. "It was not like that at all, it
939987 [51440] was quite different. You've heard it wrong; it's a libel. I was simply
939987 [51441] defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled
939987 [51442] out all my whiskers.... It's permissable for anyone, I should hope,
939987 [51443] to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on
939987 [51444] principle, for it's an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply
939987 [51445] pushed her back."
939987 [51446] 
939987 [51447] "He-he-he!" Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.
939987 [51448] 
939987 [51449] "You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But
939987 [51450] that's nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the
939987 [51451] woman question! You don't understand; I used to think, indeed, that
939987 [51452] if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is
939987 [51453] maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I
939987 [51454] reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,
939987 [51455] for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is
939987 [51456] unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality
939987 [51457] in fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is
939987 [51458] fighting... there won't be later, but at present there is... confound
939987 [51459] it! How muddled one gets with you! It's not on that account that I
939987 [51460] am not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the
939987 [51461] revolting convention of memorial dinners, that's why! Though, of course,
939987 [51462] one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won't be any priests at
939987 [51463] it. I should certainly go if there were."
939987 [51464] 
939987 [51465] "Then you would sit down at another man's table and insult it and those
939987 [51466] who invited you. Eh?"
939987 [51467] 
939987 [51468] "Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I
939987 [51469] might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It's
939987 [51470] a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the
939987 [51471] more harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And
939987 [51472] something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?
939987 [51473] They might be offended at first, but afterwards they'd see I'd done them
939987 [51474] a service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed
939987 [51475] because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to
939987 [51476] her father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally and
939987 [51477] was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,
939987 [51478] that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think
939987 [51479] that's all nonsense and there's no need of softness; on the contrary,
939987 [51480] what's wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she
939987 [51481] abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a
939987 [51482] letter: 'I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never
939987 [51483] forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there
939987 [51484] is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have
939987 [51485] only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given
939987 [51486] myself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly
939987 [51487] because I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.
939987 [51488] Do not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.'
939987 [51489] That's how letters like that ought to be written!"
939987 [51490] 
939987 [51491] "Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?"
939987 [51492] 
939987 [51493] "No, it's only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what
939987 [51494] if it were the fifteenth, that's all nonsense! And if ever I regretted
939987 [51495] the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think
939987 [51496] if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I
939987 [51497] would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would
939987 [51498] have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!"
939987 [51499] 
939987 [51500] "To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will," Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [51501] interrupted, "but tell me this; do you know the dead man's daughter, the
939987 [51502] delicate-looking little thing? It's true what they say about her, isn't
939987 [51503] it?"
939987 [51504] 
939987 [51505] "What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that
939987 [51506] this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.
939987 [51507] In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is
939987 [51508] compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,
939987 [51509] because it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she
939987 [51510] was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which
939987 [51511] she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future
939987 [51512] society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another
939987 [51513] significance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya
939987 [51514] Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against
939987 [51515] the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice
939987 [51516] indeed when I look at her!"
939987 [51517] 
939987 [51518] "I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings."
939987 [51519] 
939987 [51520] Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
939987 [51521] 
939987 [51522] "That's another slander," he yelled. "It was not so at all! That was all
939987 [51523] Katerina Ivanovna's invention, for she did not understand! And I never
939987 [51524] made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely
939987 [51525] disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her
939987 [51526] protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!"
939987 [51527] 
939987 [51528] "Have you asked her to join your community?"
939987 [51529] 
939987 [51530] "You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell
939987 [51531] you. You don't understand! There is no such rÃ´le in a community. The
939987 [51532] community is established that there should be no such rÃ´les. In a
939987 [51533] community, such a rÃ´le is essentially transformed and what is stupid
939987 [51534] here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural
939987 [51535] becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the
939987 [51536] environment. It's all the environment and man himself is nothing. And
939987 [51537] I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof
939987 [51538] that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to
939987 [51539] attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.
939987 [51540] What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of
939987 [51541] our own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our
939987 [51542] convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I'm still developing Sofya
939987 [51543] Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!"
939987 [51544] 
939987 [51545] "And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!"
939987 [51546] 
939987 [51547] "No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary."
939987 [51548] 
939987 [51549] "Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!"
939987 [51550] 
939987 [51551] "Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself
939987 [51552] how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!"
939987 [51553] 
939987 [51554] "And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her
939987 [51555] that all that modesty is nonsense?"
939987 [51556] 
939987 [51557] "Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying
939987 [51558] so--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude
939987 [51559] you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have
939987 [51560] only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question
939987 [51561] of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed
939987 [51562] prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that's for her
939987 [51563] to decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,
939987 [51564] I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but
939987 [51565] as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more
939987 [51566] respect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that's all!"
939987 [51567] 
939987 [51568] "You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never
939987 [51569] thought of that."
939987 [51570] 
939987 [51571] "You don't understand, as I've told you already! Of course, she is in
939987 [51572] such a position, but it's another question. Quite another question!
939987 [51573] You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider
939987 [51574] deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow
939987 [51575] creature. You don't know what a character she is! I am only sorry that
939987 [51576] of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used
939987 [51577] to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and
939987 [51578] resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has
939987 [51579] little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to
939987 [51580] break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she
939987 [51581] thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of
939987 [51582] hands, that is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her
939987 [51583] hand, because it's a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and
939987 [51584] I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the
939987 [51585] workmen's associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question
939987 [51586] of coming into the room in the future society."
939987 [51587] 
939987 [51588] "And what's that, pray?"
939987 [51589] 
939987 [51590] "We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community
939987 [51591] the right to enter another member's room, whether man or woman, at any
939987 [51592] time... and we decided that he has!"
939987 [51593] 
939987 [51594] "It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!"
939987 [51595] 
939987 [51596] Lebeziatnikov was really angry.
939987 [51597] 
939987 [51598] "You are always thinking of something unpleasant," he cried with
939987 [51599] aversion. "Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I
939987 [51600] referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It's always
939987 [51601] a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before
939987 [51602] they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I've often
939987 [51603] maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till
939987 [51604] he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you
939987 [51605] find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready
939987 [51606] to clean out any cesspool you like. And it's not a question of
939987 [51607] self-sacrifice, it's simply work, honourable, useful work which is
939987 [51608] as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a
939987 [51609] Pushkin, because it is more useful."
939987 [51610] 
939987 [51611] "And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!"
939987 [51612] 
939987 [51613] "What do you mean by 'more honourable'? I don't understand such
939987 [51614] expressions to describe human activity. 'More honourable,' 'nobler'--all
939987 [51615] those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is
939987 [51616] _of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!
939987 [51617] You can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!"
939987 [51618] 
939987 [51619] Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money
939987 [51620] and was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The
939987 [51621] "cesspool question" had already been a subject of dispute between them.
939987 [51622] What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it
939987 [51623] amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his
939987 [51624] young friend.
939987 [51625] 
939987 [51626] "It's your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and
939987 [51627] annoying," blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his "independence"
939987 [51628] and his "protests" did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still
939987 [51629] behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.
939987 [51630] 
939987 [51631] "You'd better tell me this," Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty
939987 [51632] displeasure, "can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with
939987 [51633] that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think
939987 [51634] they've all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of
939987 [51635] steps... I want to see her, that young person."
939987 [51636] 
939987 [51637] "What for?" Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.
939987 [51638] 
939987 [51639] "Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I
939987 [51640] wanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the
939987 [51641] interview. It's better you should be, indeed. For there's no knowing
939987 [51642] what you might imagine."
939987 [51643] 
939987 [51644] "I shan't imagine anything. I only asked and, if you've anything to say
939987 [51645] to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I'll go directly and you
939987 [51646] may be sure I won't be in your way."
939987 [51647] 
939987 [51648] Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very
939987 [51649] much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in
939987 [51650] such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as
939987 [51651] a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her "politely
939987 [51652] and affably," but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in
939987 [51653] his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight
939987 [51654] in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He
939987 [51655] hastened to "reassure" her and made her sit down facing him at the
939987 [51656] table. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes
939987 [51657] lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes
939987 [51658] remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr
939987 [51659] Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.
939987 [51660] 
939987 [51661] "Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?" he asked him in a whisper.
939987 [51662] 
939987 [51663] "Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....
939987 [51664] Why?"
939987 [51665] 
939987 [51666] "Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave
939987 [51667] me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,
939987 [51668] but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn't like Raskolnikov to
939987 [51669] repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?"
939987 [51670] 
939987 [51671] "I understand!" Lebeziatnikov saw the point. "Yes, you are right.... Of
939987 [51672] course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,
939987 [51673] but... still, you are right. Certainly I'll stay. I'll stand here at the
939987 [51674] window and not be in your way... I think you are right..."
939987 [51675] 
939987 [51676] Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked
939987 [51677] attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe
939987 [51678] expression, as much as to say, "don't you make any mistake, madam."
939987 [51679] Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.
939987 [51680] 
939987 [51681] "In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your
939987 [51682] respected mamma.... That's right, isn't it? Katerina Ivanovna stands
939987 [51683] in the place of a mother to you?" Pyotr Petrovitch began with great
939987 [51684] dignity, though affably.
939987 [51685] 
939987 [51686] It was evident that his intentions were friendly.
939987 [51687] 
939987 [51688] "Quite so, yes; the place of a mother," Sonia answered, timidly and
939987 [51689] hurriedly.
939987 [51690] 
939987 [51691] "Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable
939987 [51692] circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in
939987 [51693] spite of your mamma's kind invitation."
939987 [51694] 
939987 [51695] "Yes... I'll tell her... at once."
939987 [51696] 
939987 [51697] And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.
939987 [51698] 
939987 [51699] "Wait, that's not all," Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her
939987 [51700] simplicity and ignorance of good manners, "and you know me little, my
939987 [51701] dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble
939987 [51702] a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself
939987 [51703] only. I have another object."
939987 [51704] 
939987 [51705] Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the
939987 [51706] grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she
939987 [51707] quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it
939987 [51708] horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person's
939987 [51709] money. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held
939987 [51710] in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a
939987 [51711] yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not
939987 [51712] knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight
939987 [51713] in the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.
939987 [51714] 
939987 [51715] "I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with
939987 [51716] Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to
939987 [51717] ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so
939987 [51718] express it."
939987 [51719] 
939987 [51720] "Yes... preternatural..." Sonia hurriedly assented.
939987 [51721] 
939987 [51722] "Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill."
939987 [51723] 
939987 [51724] "Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill."
939987 [51725] 
939987 [51726] "Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak
939987 [51727] compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,
939987 [51728] foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this
939987 [51729] poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?"
939987 [51730] 
939987 [51731] "Allow me to ask," Sonia rose to her feet, "did you say something to her
939987 [51732] yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had
939987 [51733] undertaken to get her one. Was that true?"
939987 [51734] 
939987 [51735] "Not in the slightest, and indeed it's an absurdity! I merely hinted at
939987 [51736] her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had
939987 [51737] died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your
939987 [51738] late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the
939987 [51739] service at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be
939987 [51740] very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in
939987 [51741] that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,
939987 [51742] he-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!"
939987 [51743] 
939987 [51744] "Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes
939987 [51745] everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like
939987 [51746] that... yes... You must excuse her," said Sonia, and again she got up to
939987 [51747] go.
939987 [51748] 
939987 [51749] "But you haven't heard what I have to say."
939987 [51750] 
939987 [51751] "No, I haven't heard," muttered Sonia.
939987 [51752] 
939987 [51753] "Then sit down." She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third
939987 [51754] time.
939987 [51755] 
939987 [51756] "Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,
939987 [51757] as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,
939987 [51758] that is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get
939987 [51759] up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as
939987 [51760] is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous
939987 [51761] of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might
939987 [51762] be done."
939987 [51763] 
939987 [51764] "Yes, yes... God will repay you for it," faltered Sonia, gazing intently
939987 [51765] at Pyotr Petrovitch.
939987 [51766] 
939987 [51767] "It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we
939987 [51768] will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come
939987 [51769] to me at seven o'clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But
939987 [51770] there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and
939987 [51771] for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In
939987 [51772] my opinion money cannot be, indeed it's unsafe to put it into Katerina
939987 [51773] Ivanovna's own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she
939987 [51774] has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots
939987 [51775] or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,
939987 [51776] I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.
939987 [51777] To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust of
939987 [51778] bread. It's absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought
939987 [51779] to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but
939987 [51780] only you, for instance. Am I right?"
939987 [51781] 
939987 [51782] "I don't know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was
939987 [51783] so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very
939987 [51784] sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will
939987 [51785] all be... and God will reward... and the orphans..."
939987 [51786] 
939987 [51787] Sonia burst into tears.
939987 [51788] 
939987 [51789] "Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the
939987 [51790] benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me
939987 [51791] personally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in
939987 [51792] connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I
939987 [51793] cannot do more..."
939987 [51794] 
939987 [51795] And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully
939987 [51796] unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something
939987 [51797] and began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously
939987 [51798] to the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,
939987 [51799] and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.
939987 [51800] 
939987 [51801] All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the
939987 [51802] room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he
939987 [51803] walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
939987 [51804] 
939987 [51805] "I heard and _saw_ everything," he said, laying stress on the last verb.
939987 [51806] "That is honourable, I mean to say, it's humane! You wanted to avoid
939987 [51807] gratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle
939987 [51808] sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the
939987 [51809] evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with
939987 [51810] pleasure--yes, yes, I like it."
939987 [51811] 
939987 [51812] "That's all nonsense," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,
939987 [51813] looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
939987 [51814] 
939987 [51815] "No, it's not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as
939987 [51816] you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,
939987 [51817] such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still
939987 [51818] deserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr
939987 [51819] Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback
939987 [51820] your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your
939987 [51821] ill-luck yesterday," cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt
939987 [51822] a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. "And, what do you want with
939987 [51823] marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do
939987 [51824] you cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you
939987 [51825] like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't come off, that you are
939987 [51826] free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I've spoken
939987 [51827] my mind!"
939987 [51828] 
939987 [51829] "Because I don't want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and
939987 [51830] to bring up another man's children, that's why I want legal marriage,"
939987 [51831] Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.
939987 [51832] 
939987 [51833] He seemed preoccupied by something.
939987 [51834] 
939987 [51835] "Children? You referred to children," Lebeziatnikov started off like
939987 [51836] a warhorse at the trumpet call. "Children are a social question and a
939987 [51837] question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has
939987 [51838] another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they
939987 [51839] suggest the institution of the family. We'll speak of children later,
939987 [51840] but now as to the question of honour, I confess that's my weak point.
939987 [51841] That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the
939987 [51842] dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It's nonsense,
939987 [51843] there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural
939987 [51844] consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.
939987 [51845] So that indeed it's not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an
939987 [51846] absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of
939987 [51847] it. I should say to my wife: 'My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now
939987 [51848] I respect you, for you've shown you can protest!' You laugh! That's
939987 [51849] because you are of incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound
939987 [51850] it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived
939987 [51851] in a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable consequence of a
939987 [51852] despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is
939987 [51853] open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it's unthinkable.
939987 [51854] Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you
939987 [51855] incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for
939987 [51856] her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,
939987 [51857] pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it's just the same,
939987 [51858] I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for
939987 [51859] herself. 'My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but even more than that I
939987 [51860] desire you to respect me. See!' Am I not right?"
939987 [51861] 
939987 [51862] Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.
939987 [51863] He hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and
939987 [51864] even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited
939987 [51865] and rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected
939987 [51866] upon it afterwards.
939987 [51867] 
939987 [51868] 
939987 [51869] 
939987 [51870] CHAPTER II
939987 [51871] 
939987 [51872] It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the
939987 [51873] idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna's disordered brain.
939987 [51874] Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's
939987 [51875] funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to
939987 [51876] honour the memory of the deceased "suitably," that all the lodgers,
939987 [51877] and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know "that he was in no way their
939987 [51878] inferior, and perhaps very much their superior," and that no one had the
939987 [51879] right "to turn up his nose at him." Perhaps the chief element was that
939987 [51880] peculiar "poor man's pride," which compels many poor people to spend
939987 [51881] their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order
939987 [51882] to do "like other people," and not to "be looked down upon." It is very
939987 [51883] probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at
939987 [51884] the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those
939987 [51885] "wretched contemptible lodgers" that she knew "how to do things, how
939987 [51886] to entertain" and that she had been brought up "in a genteel, she might
939987 [51887] almost say aristocratic colonel's family" and had not been meant for
939987 [51888] sweeping floors and washing the children's rags at night. Even the
939987 [51889] poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these
939987 [51890] paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible
939987 [51891] nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she
939987 [51892] might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have
939987 [51893] been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will
939987 [51894] could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her
939987 [51895] mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year
939987 [51896] past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.
939987 [51897] The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the
939987 [51898] intellect.
939987 [51899] 
939987 [51900] There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine
939987 [51901] there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest
939987 [51902] quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and
939987 [51903] honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of
939987 [51904] pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen. Two samovars were
939987 [51905] boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina
939987 [51906] Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help
939987 [51907] of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been
939987 [51908] stranded at Madame Lippevechsel's. He promptly put himself at Katerina
939987 [51909] Ivanovna's disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before
939987 [51910] running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious
939987 [51911] that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina
939987 [51912] Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called
939987 [51913] her "_Pani_." She was heartily sick of him before the end, though
939987 [51914] she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this
939987 [51915] "serviceable and magnanimous man." It was one of Katerina Ivanovna's
939987 [51916] characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.
939987 [51917] Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she
939987 [51918] would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance
939987 [51919] and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she
939987 [51920] would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the
939987 [51921] person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She
939987 [51922] was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from
939987 [51923] continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_
939987 [51924] that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the
939987 [51925] peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost
939987 [51926] to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and
939987 [51927] fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against
939987 [51928] the wall.
939987 [51929] 
939987 [51930] Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in
939987 [51931] Katerina Ivanovna's eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary
939987 [51932] respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart
939987 [51933] and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,
939987 [51934] to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her
939987 [51935] kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone
939987 [51936] herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the
939987 [51937] table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses
939987 [51938] were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,
939987 [51939] but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,
939987 [51940] feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and
939987 [51941] a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some
939987 [51942] pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for
939987 [51943] some reason: "as though the table could not have been laid except by
939987 [51944] Amalia Ivanovna!" She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. "Could she
939987 [51945] be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,
939987 [51946] and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!
939987 [51947] Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna's father who had been a colonel and almost
939987 [51948] a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then
939987 [51949] anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been
939987 [51950] allowed into the kitchen."
939987 [51951] 
939987 [51952] Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the
939987 [51953] time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided
939987 [51954] inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down
939987 [51955] and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was
939987 [51956] fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that
939987 [51957] hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except
939987 [51958] the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the
939987 [51959] memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned
939987 [51960] up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older
939987 [51961] and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.
939987 [51962] Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most
939987 [51963] respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [51964] had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,
939987 [51965] Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,
939987 [51966] noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had
939987 [51967] been a friend of her first husband's, and a guest in her father's
939987 [51968] house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her
939987 [51969] a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [51970] exalted anyone's connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior
939987 [51971] motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to
939987 [51972] the consequence of the person praised. Probably "taking his cue" from
939987 [51973] Luzhin, "that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up
939987 [51974] either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness
939987 [51975] and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a
939987 [51976] friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him."
939987 [51977] 
939987 [51978] Among those who failed to appear were "the genteel lady and her
939987 [51979] old-maidish daughter," who had only been lodgers in the house for the
939987 [51980] last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar
939987 [51981] in Katerina Ivanovna's room, especially when Marmeladov had come
939987 [51982] back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,
939987 [51983] quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole
939987 [51984] family out of doors, had shouted at her that they "were not worth the
939987 [51985] foot" of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina
939987 [51986] Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, "whose
939987 [51987] foot she was not worth," and who had turned away haughtily when she
939987 [51988] casually met them, so that they might know that "she was more noble in
939987 [51989] her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice," and might see
939987 [51990] that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to
939987 [51991] make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father's
939987 [51992] governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly
939987 [51993] stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he
939987 [51994] was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it
939987 [51995] appeared that he had been "not himself" for the last two days. The party
939987 [51996] consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and
939987 [51997] a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt
939987 [51998] abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the
939987 [51999] post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone
939987 [52000] at Amalia Ivanovna's.
939987 [52001] 
939987 [52002] A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was
939987 [52003] drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without
939987 [52004] a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without
939987 [52005] even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit
939987 [52006] appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of
939987 [52007] Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought
939987 [52008] with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna's
939987 [52009] and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina
939987 [52010] Ivanovna intensely. "For whom had they made all these preparations
939987 [52011] then?" To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid
939987 [52012] for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the
939987 [52013] furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big
939987 [52014] girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like
939987 [52015] well-bred children's.
939987 [52016] 
939987 [52017] Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with
939987 [52018] increased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with
939987 [52019] special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing
939987 [52020] to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who
939987 [52021] were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the
939987 [52022] latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen
939987 [52023] for the end. All were seated at last.
939987 [52024] 
939987 [52025] Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
939987 [52026] cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the
939987 [52027] first place, because he was the one "educated visitor, and, as everyone
939987 [52028] knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university," and
939987 [52029] secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having
939987 [52030] been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and
939987 [52031] made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In
939987 [52032] spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round
939987 [52033] correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising
939987 [52034] cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse
939987 [52035] during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to
939987 [52036] Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at
939987 [52037] the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and
939987 [52038] uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of
939987 [52039] her landlady.
939987 [52040] 
939987 [52041] "It's all that cuckoo's fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!" Katerina
939987 [52042] Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. "Look at her, she's making round
939987 [52043] eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can't understand.
939987 [52044] Pfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that
939987 [52045] cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone
939987 [52046] to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being
939987 [52047] here? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially
939987 [52048] those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has
939987 [52049] brought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those
939987 [52050] wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever
939987 [52051] poked his nose in here, I've never set eyes on them. What have they come
939987 [52052] here for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!" she cried
939987 [52053] suddenly to one of them, "have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!
939987 [52054] Have some beer! Won't you have some vodka? Look, he's jumped up and is
939987 [52055] making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,
939987 [52056] let them eat! They don't make a noise, anyway, though I'm really afraid
939987 [52057] for our landlady's silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!" she addressed her
939987 [52058] suddenly, almost aloud, "if your spoons should happen to be stolen,
939987 [52059] I won't be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!" She laughed turning to
939987 [52060] Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her
939987 [52061] sally. "She didn't understand, she didn't understand again! Look how
939987 [52062] she sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,
939987 [52063] ha-ha-ha!"
939987 [52064] 
939987 [52065] Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that
939987 [52066] lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead
939987 [52067] and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov
939987 [52068] the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began
939987 [52069] whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her
939987 [52070] cheeks.
939987 [52071] 
939987 [52072] "Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,
939987 [52073] for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am
939987 [52074] speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she
939987 [52075] has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that
939987 [52076] provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and
939987 [52077] has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the
939987 [52078] government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody
939987 [52079] knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has
939987 [52080] not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners
939987 [52081] required! I can't understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But
939987 [52082] where's Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,
939987 [52083] Sonia, where have you been? It's odd that even at your father's funeral
939987 [52084] you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her
939987 [52085] beside you. That's your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of
939987 [52086] the cold entrÃ©e with jelly, that's the best. They'll bring the pancakes
939987 [52087] directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got
939987 [52088] everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That's all right. Be a good girl, Lida,
939987 [52089] and, Kolya, don't fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.
939987 [52090] What are you saying, Sonia?"
939987 [52091] 
939987 [52092] Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying to
939987 [52093] speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most
939987 [52094] respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added
939987 [52095] that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as
939987 [52096] he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone
939987 [52097] with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.
939987 [52098] 
939987 [52099] Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her
939987 [52100] and gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a
939987 [52101] hurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time
939987 [52102] she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed
939987 [52103] absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying
939987 [52104] to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get
939987 [52105] mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her
939987 [52106] only dress, a dark striped cotton one.
939987 [52107] 
939987 [52108] The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to
939987 [52109] Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how
939987 [52110] Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to
939987 [52111] Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of
939987 [52112] Pyotr Petrovitch's position and standing to find himself in such
939987 [52113] "extraordinary company," in spite of his devotion to her family and his
939987 [52114] old friendship with her father.
939987 [52115] 
939987 [52116] "That's why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have
939987 [52117] not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings," she added
939987 [52118] almost aloud. "But I am sure that it was only your special affection for
939987 [52119] my poor husband that has made you keep your promise."
939987 [52120] 
939987 [52121] Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and
939987 [52122] suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: "Wouldn't he
939987 [52123] have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?" The old man made
939987 [52124] no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,
939987 [52125] though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He
939987 [52126] simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the
939987 [52127] general mirth.
939987 [52128] 
939987 [52129] "What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr
939987 [52130] Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him," Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [52131] continued, "and, of course, he is not like..." with an extremely stern
939987 [52132] face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter
939987 [52133] was quite disconcerted, "not like your dressed up draggletails whom
939987 [52134] my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late
939987 [52135] husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the
939987 [52136] goodness of his heart."
939987 [52137] 
939987 [52138] "Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!" cried the
939987 [52139] commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.
939987 [52140] 
939987 [52141] "My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows
939987 [52142] it," Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, "but he was a kind and
939987 [52143] honourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was
939987 [52144] his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he
939987 [52145] drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you
939987 [52146] believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his
939987 [52147] pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!"
939987 [52148] 
939987 [52149] "A cock? Did you say a cock?" shouted the commissariat clerk.
939987 [52150] 
939987 [52151] Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in
939987 [52152] thought.
939987 [52153] 
939987 [52154] "No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him," she
939987 [52155] went on, addressing Raskolnikov. "But that's not so! He respected me, he
939987 [52156] respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was
939987 [52157] for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to
939987 [52158] feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would
939987 [52159] think to myself: 'Be kind to him and he will drink again,' it was only
939987 [52160] by severity that you could keep him within bounds."
939987 [52161] 
939987 [52162] "Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often," roared the
939987 [52163] commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.
939987 [52164] 
939987 [52165] "Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having
939987 [52166] their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!" Katerina
939987 [52167] Ivanovna snapped at him.
939987 [52168] 
939987 [52169] The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In
939987 [52170] another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the
939987 [52171] visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the
939987 [52172] commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently
939987 [52173] trying to egg him on.
939987 [52174] 
939987 [52175] "Allow me to ask what are you alluding to," began the clerk, "that is
939987 [52176] to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don't care!
939987 [52177] That's nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!"
939987 [52178] 
939987 [52179] And he took another drink of vodka.
939987 [52180] 
939987 [52181] Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from
939987 [52182] politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually
939987 [52183] putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia
939987 [52184] intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,
939987 [52185] too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with
939987 [52186] terror Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,
939987 [52187] was the chief reason for the 'genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment of
939987 [52188] Katerina Ivanovna's invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that
939987 [52189] the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the
939987 [52190] question: "How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young
939987 [52191] person_?" Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard
939987 [52192] this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an
939987 [52193] insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that
939987 [52194] Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, "till she had shown those
939987 [52195] draggletails that they were both..." To make matters worse someone
939987 [52196] passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts
939987 [52197] pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed
939987 [52198] crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it
939987 [52199] was "a drunken ass!"
939987 [52200] 
939987 [52201] Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time
939987 [52202] deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna's haughtiness, and to restore the
939987 [52203] good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,
939987 [52204] apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers "Karl
939987 [52205] from the chemist's," who was driving one night in a cab, and that "the
939987 [52206] cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,
939987 [52207] and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his
939987 [52208] heart." Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that
939987 [52209] Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was
939987 [52210] still more offended, and she retorted that her "_Vater aus Berlin_ was a
939987 [52211] very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets." Katerina
939987 [52212] Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia
939987 [52213] Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.
939987 [52214] 
939987 [52215] "Listen to the owl!" Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her
939987 [52216] good-humour almost restored, "she meant to say he kept his hands in
939987 [52217] his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people's pockets.
939987 [52218] (Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these
939987 [52219] Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than
939987 [52220] we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how 'Karl from the chemist's'
939987 [52221] 'pierced his heart from fear' and that the idiot, instead of punishing
939987 [52222] the cabman, 'clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.' Ah, the fool!
939987 [52223] And you know she fancies it's very touching and does not suspect how
939987 [52224] stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great
939987 [52225] deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with
939987 [52226] drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved
939987 [52227] and serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!
939987 [52228] (Cough-cough-cough.)"
939987 [52229] 
939987 [52230] Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling
939987 [52231] Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open
939987 [52232] a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.
939987 [52233] This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she
939987 [52234] launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that
939987 [52235] Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of
939987 [52236] which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told
939987 [52237] him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance
939987 [52238] before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This
939987 [52239] certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina
939987 [52240] Ivanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself
939987 [52241] with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming "those two stuck-up
939987 [52242] draggletails" if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably
939987 [52243] that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, "she might even say
939987 [52244] aristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was far superior to
939987 [52245] certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late." The
939987 [52246] certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken
939987 [52247] guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually
939987 [52248] contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the
939987 [52249] rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really
939987 [52250] was almost the daughter of a colonel.
939987 [52251] 
939987 [52252] Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and
939987 [52253] happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom
939987 [52254] she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most
939987 [52255] respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [52256] herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt
939987 [52257] teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would
939987 [52258] go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at
939987 [52259] the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
939987 [52260] 
939987 [52261] Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of
939987 [52262] it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of
939987 [52263] Sonia's undoubted ability to assist her, of "her gentleness, patience,
939987 [52264] devotion, generosity and good education," tapping Sonia on the cheek and
939987 [52265] kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [52266] suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was "nervous
939987 [52267] and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and
939987 [52268] as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea."
939987 [52269] 
939987 [52270] At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
939987 [52271] the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,
939987 [52272] and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
939987 [52273] observation, that "in the future boarding-school she would have to pay
939987 [52274] particular attention to _die WÃ¤sche_, and that there certainly must be a
939987 [52275] good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies
939987 [52276] must not novels at night read."
939987 [52277] 
939987 [52278] Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as
939987 [52279] heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying
939987 [52280] "she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the
939987 [52281] business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class
939987 [52282] boarding-school to look after _die WÃ¤sche_, and as for novel-reading,
939987 [52283] that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent." Amalia
939987 [52284] Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only "meant her
939987 [52285] good," and that "she had meant her very good," and that "it was long
939987 [52286] since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings."
939987 [52287] 
939987 [52288] Katerina Ivanovna at once "set her down," saying that it was a lie to
939987 [52289] say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband
939987 [52290] was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this
939987 [52291] Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those
939987 [52292] ladies, but "those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_
939987 [52293] ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady." Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [52294] at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge
939987 [52295] what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her
939987 [52296] "_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in
939987 [52297] pockets went, and always used to say: 'Poof! poof!'" and she leapt
939987 [52298] up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her
939987 [52299] pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling "poof!
939987 [52300] poof!" amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged
939987 [52301] Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.
939987 [52302] 
939987 [52303] But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,
939987 [52304] so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a
939987 [52305] father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once
939987 [52306] been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red
939987 [52307] as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a
939987 [52308] father, "but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat
939987 [52309] and always said poof-poof-poof!"
939987 [52310] 
939987 [52311] Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
939987 [52312] was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print
939987 [52313] that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father--if she
939987 [52314] really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she
939987 [52315] never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name
939987 [52316] was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
939987 [52317] 
939987 [52318] At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,
939987 [52319] and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, "that
939987 [52320] her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that
939987 [52321] Katerina Ivanovna's _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister." Katerina
939987 [52322] Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice
939987 [52323] (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that "if she
939987 [52324] dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a
939987 [52325] level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her
939987 [52326] head and trample it under foot." Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,
939987 [52327] shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and
939987 [52328] that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she
939987 [52329] rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
939987 [52330] There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia
939987 [52331] ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted
939987 [52332] something about "the yellow ticket," Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia
939987 [52333] away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.
939987 [52334] 
939987 [52335] At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared
939987 [52336] on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant
939987 [52337] eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.
939987 [52338] 
939987 [52339] 
939987 [52340] 
939987 [52341] CHAPTER III
939987 [52342] 
939987 [52343] "Pyotr Petrovitch," she cried, "protect me... you at least! Make this
939987 [52344] foolish woman understand that she can't behave like this to a lady in
939987 [52345] misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I'll go to the
939987 [52346] governor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my
939987 [52347] father's hospitality protect these orphans."
939987 [52348] 
939987 [52349] "Allow me, madam.... Allow me." Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. "Your
939987 [52350] papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing" (someone
939987 [52351] laughed aloud) "and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting
939987 [52352] squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own
939987 [52353] affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...
939987 [52354] Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass."
939987 [52355] 
939987 [52356] Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia
939987 [52357] was.
939987 [52358] 
939987 [52359] Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though
939987 [52360] thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny
939987 [52361] having enjoyed her father's hospitality. Though she had invented it
939987 [52362] herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too
939987 [52363] by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr
939987 [52364] Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not
939987 [52365] only was this "serious business man" strikingly incongruous with the
939987 [52366] rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some
939987 [52367] matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him
939987 [52368] and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing
939987 [52369] beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not
939987 [52370] seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the
939987 [52371] doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked
939987 [52372] interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.
939987 [52373] 
939987 [52374] "Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's a matter of
939987 [52375] some importance," Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company
939987 [52376] generally. "I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia
939987 [52377] Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful
939987 [52378] attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,"
939987 [52379] he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already
939987 [52380] alarmed, "immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble
939987 [52381] note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.
939987 [52382] Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where
939987 [52383] it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to
939987 [52384] witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be
939987 [52385] compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must
939987 [52386] blame yourself."
939987 [52387] 
939987 [52388] Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were
939987 [52389] still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a
939987 [52390] word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.
939987 [52391] 
939987 [52392] "Well, how is it to be then?" asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.
939987 [52393] 
939987 [52394] "I don't know.... I know nothing about it," Sonia articulated faintly at
939987 [52395] last.
939987 [52396] 
939987 [52397] "No, you know nothing?" Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some
939987 [52398] seconds. "Think a moment, mademoiselle," he began severely, but still,
939987 [52399] as it were, admonishing her. "Reflect, I am prepared to give you time
939987 [52400] for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely
939987 [52401] convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to
939987 [52402] accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before
939987 [52403] witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense
939987 [52404] be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for
939987 [52405] my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of
939987 [52406] approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my
939987 [52407] pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.
939987 [52408] Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three
939987 [52409] hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
939987 [52410] About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three
939987 [52411] notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my
939987 [52412] invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly
939987 [52413] embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the
939987 [52414] conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness
939987 [52415] to this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm
939987 [52416] my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in
939987 [52417] order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your
939987 [52418] relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),
939987 [52419] and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a
939987 [52420] subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and
939987 [52421] even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to
939987 [52422] recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest
939987 [52423] detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from
939987 [52424] the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part
939987 [52425] for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then
939987 [52426] I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of
939987 [52427] embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I
939987 [52428] talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I
939987 [52429] returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count
939987 [52430] it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one
939987 [52431] hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.
939987 [52432] Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such
939987 [52433] a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the
939987 [52434] minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the
939987 [52435] total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your
939987 [52436] eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some
939987 [52437] time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position
939987 [52438] and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and
939987 [52439] positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a
939987 [52440] cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in
939987 [52441] spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in
939987 [52442] making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have
939987 [52443] taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing
939987 [52444] to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your
939987 [52445] destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and
939987 [52446] you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too
939987 [52447] bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg
939987 [52448] you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you
939987 [52449] are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?"
939987 [52450] 
939987 [52451] "I have taken nothing," Sonia whispered in terror, "you gave me ten
939987 [52452] roubles, here it is, take it."
939987 [52453] 
939987 [52454] Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,
939987 [52455] took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.
939987 [52456] 
939987 [52457] "And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?" he insisted
939987 [52458] reproachfully, not taking the note.
939987 [52459] 
939987 [52460] Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,
939987 [52461] ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against
939987 [52462] the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.
939987 [52463] 
939987 [52464] "Good God!" broke from Sonia.
939987 [52465] 
939987 [52466] "Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore
939987 [52467] I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter," Luzhin said
939987 [52468] softly and even kindly.
939987 [52469] 
939987 [52470] "_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief," cried Amalia
939987 [52471] Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
939987 [52472] 
939987 [52473] "You knew it?" Luzhin caught her up, "then I suppose you had some reason
939987 [52474] before this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to
939987 [52475] remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses."
939987 [52476] 
939987 [52477] There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in
939987 [52478] movement.
939987 [52479] 
939987 [52480] "What!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and
939987 [52481] she rushed at Luzhin. "What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the
939987 [52482] wretches, the wretches!"
939987 [52483] 
939987 [52484] And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as
939987 [52485] in a vise.
939987 [52486] 
939987 [52487] "Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it
939987 [52488] to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!"
939987 [52489] 
939987 [52490] And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and
939987 [52491] flung it straight into Luzhin's face. It hit him in the eye and fell
939987 [52492] on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [52493] lost his temper.
939987 [52494] 
939987 [52495] "Hold that mad woman!" he shouted.
939987 [52496] 
939987 [52497] At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in
939987 [52498] the doorway, among them the two ladies.
939987 [52499] 
939987 [52500] "What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!" shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. "You are an
939987 [52501] idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his
939987 [52502] money! Sonia a thief! Why, she'd give away her last penny!" and Katerina
939987 [52503] Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. "Did you ever see such an
939987 [52504] idiot?" she turned from side to side. "And you too?" she suddenly saw
939987 [52505] the landlady, "and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a
939987 [52506] thief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a crinoline! She hasn't been
939987 [52507] out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down
939987 [52508] beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search
939987 [52509] her! Since she's not left the room, the money would have to be on her!
939987 [52510] Search her, search her! But if you don't find it, then excuse me, my
939987 [52511] dear fellow, you'll answer for it! I'll go to our Sovereign, to our
939987 [52512] Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,
939987 [52513] to-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do
939987 [52514] you think they wouldn't? You're wrong, I will get in! I will get in!
939987 [52515] You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so
939987 [52516] submissive, let me tell you! You've gone too far yourself. Search her,
939987 [52517] search her!"
939987 [52518] 
939987 [52519] And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards
939987 [52520] Sonia.
939987 [52521] 
939987 [52522] "I am ready, I'll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm
939987 [52523] yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to
939987 [52524] that..." Luzhin muttered, "that ought to be before the police... though
939987 [52525] indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in
939987 [52526] any case it's difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with
939987 [52527] the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it's not the way to do
939987 [52528] things.... How is it to be done?"
939987 [52529] 
939987 [52530] "As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.
939987 [52531] "Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,
939987 [52532] here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D'you see,
939987 [52533] d'you see?"
939987 [52534] 
939987 [52535] And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside
939987 [52536] out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing
939987 [52537] a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin's feet. Everyone saw it, several
939987 [52538] cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two
939987 [52539] fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a
939987 [52540] hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note
939987 [52541] showing it to everyone.
939987 [52542] 
939987 [52543] "Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!" yelled Amalia Ivanovna.
939987 [52544] "They must to Siberia be sent! Away!"
939987 [52545] 
939987 [52546] Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his
939987 [52547] eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.
939987 [52548] Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel
939987 [52549] surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry
939987 [52550] and hid her face in her hands.
939987 [52551] 
939987 [52552] "No, it wasn't I! I didn't take it! I know nothing about it," she cried
939987 [52553] with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped
939987 [52554] her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the
939987 [52555] world.
939987 [52556] 
939987 [52557] "Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! You see, I don't believe it!" she
939987 [52558] cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her
939987 [52559] arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her
939987 [52560] hands and kissing them, too, "you took it! How stupid these people are!
939987 [52561] Oh dear! You are fools, fools," she cried, addressing the whole room,
939987 [52562] "you don't know, you don't know what a heart she has, what a girl she
939987 [52563] is! She take it, she? She'd sell her last rag, she'd go barefoot to help
939987 [52564] you if you needed it, that's what she is! She has the yellow passport
939987 [52565] because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,
939987 [52566] husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!
939987 [52567] Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion
939987 [52568] Romanovitch, why don't you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You
939987 [52569] are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend
939987 [52570] her now, at least!"
939987 [52571] 
939987 [52572] The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a
939987 [52573] great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,
939987 [52574] the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained
939987 [52575] as a child's, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help
939987 [52576] were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch
939987 [52577] at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.
939987 [52578] 
939987 [52579] "Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!" he cried
939987 [52580] impressively, "no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an
939987 [52581] instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved
939987 [52582] her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous
939987 [52583] idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,
939987 [52584] so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to
939987 [52585] confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?
939987 [52586] You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how
939987 [52587] could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen," he
939987 [52588] addressed the whole company, "gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,
939987 [52589] commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite
939987 [52590] of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a
939987 [52591] lesson to you for the future," he said, addressing Sonia, "and I will
939987 [52592] carry the matter no further. Enough!"
939987 [52593] 
939987 [52594] Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the
939987 [52595] fire in Raskolnikov's seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile
939987 [52596] Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging
939987 [52597] Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on
939987 [52598] all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was
939987 [52599] wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty
939987 [52600] little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia's shoulder.
939987 [52601] 
939987 [52602] "How vile!" a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
939987 [52603] 
939987 [52604] Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.
939987 [52605] 
939987 [52606] "What vileness!" Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the
939987 [52607] face.
939987 [52608] 
939987 [52609] Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it
939987 [52610] afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
939987 [52611] 
939987 [52612] "And you dared to call me as witness?" he said, going up to Pyotr
939987 [52613] Petrovitch.
939987 [52614] 
939987 [52615] "What do you mean? What are you talking about?" muttered Luzhin.
939987 [52616] 
939987 [52617] "I mean that you... are a slanderer, that's what my words mean!"
939987 [52618] Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted
939987 [52619] eyes.
939987 [52620] 
939987 [52621] He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though
939987 [52622] seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr
939987 [52623] Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.
939987 [52624] 
939987 [52625] "If you mean that for me,..." he began, stammering. "But what's the
939987 [52626] matter with you? Are you out of your mind?"
939987 [52627] 
939987 [52628] "I'm in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard
939987 [52629] everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own
939987 [52630] even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I
939987 [52631] can't understand."
939987 [52632] 
939987 [52633] "Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical
939987 [52634] riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!"
939987 [52635] 
939987 [52636] "You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch
939987 [52637] vodka, for it's against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he
939987 [52638] himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble
939987 [52639] note--I saw it, I was a witness, I'll take my oath! He did it, he!"
939987 [52640] repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.
939987 [52641] 
939987 [52642] "Are you crazy, milksop?" squealed Luzhin. "She is herself before
939987 [52643] you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her
939987 [52644] only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?"
939987 [52645] 
939987 [52646] "I saw it, I saw it," Lebeziatnikov repeated, "and though it is against
939987 [52647] my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like
939987 [52648] before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only
939987 [52649] like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying
939987 [52650] good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with
939987 [52651] the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I
939987 [52652] saw it!"
939987 [52653] 
939987 [52654] Luzhin turned pale.
939987 [52655] 
939987 [52656] "What lies!" he cried impudently, "why, how could you, standing by the
939987 [52657] window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You
939987 [52658] are raving!"
939987 [52659] 
939987 [52660] "No, I didn't fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw
939987 [52661] it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from
939987 [52662] the window--that's true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble
939987 [52663] note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,
939987 [52664] you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I
939987 [52665] was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not
939987 [52666] forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand
939987 [52667] all the time. I didn't think of it again until, when you were getting
939987 [52668] up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped
939987 [52669] it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant
939987 [52670] to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you
939987 [52671] and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I
939987 [52672] saw it, I'll take my oath."
939987 [52673] 
939987 [52674] Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands
939987 [52675] chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all
939987 [52676] crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
939987 [52677] 
939987 [52678] "I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her
939987 [52679] part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!"
939987 [52680] 
939987 [52681] Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees
939987 [52682] before him.
939987 [52683] 
939987 [52684] "A pack of nonsense!" yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, "it's all nonsense
939987 [52685] you've been talking! 'An idea struck you, you didn't think, you
939987 [52686] noticed'--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on
939987 [52687] purpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?"
939987 [52688] 
939987 [52689] "What for? That's what I can't understand, but that what I am telling
939987 [52690] you is the fact, that's certain! So far from my being mistaken, you
939987 [52691] infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question
939987 [52692] occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing
939987 [52693] your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it
939987 [52694] secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that
939987 [52695] my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private
939987 [52696] benevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you
939987 [52697] really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,
939987 [52698] too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole
939987 [52699] hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people
939987 [52700] are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then
939987 [52701] the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,
939987 [52702] when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you
939987 [52703] wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand
939987 [52704] should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so
939987 [52705] many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it
939987 [52706] indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck
939987 [52707] me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she
939987 [52708] noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of
939987 [52709] the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.
939987 [52710] But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov's to take them the
939987 [52711] 'General Treatise on the Positive Method' and especially to recommend
939987 [52712] Piderit's article (and also Wagner's); then I come on here and what a
939987 [52713] state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and
939987 [52714] reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her
939987 [52715] pocket?"
939987 [52716] 
939987 [52717] When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical
939987 [52718] deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed
939987 [52719] from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly
939987 [52720] in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite
939987 [52721] exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech
939987 [52722] produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such
939987 [52723] conviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt
939987 [52724] that things were going badly with him.
939987 [52725] 
939987 [52726] "What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?" he shouted,
939987 [52727] "that's no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that's all! And I tell you,
939987 [52728] you are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against
939987 [52729] me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,
939987 [52730] godless, social propositions!"
939987 [52731] 
939987 [52732] But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval
939987 [52733] were heard on all sides.
939987 [52734] 
939987 [52735] "Ah, that's your line now, is it!" cried Lebeziatnikov, "that's
939987 [52736] nonsense! Call the police and I'll take my oath! There's only one thing
939987 [52737] I can't understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,
939987 [52738] pitiful, despicable man!"
939987 [52739] 
939987 [52740] "I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,
939987 [52741] will swear to it," Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he
939987 [52742] stepped forward.
939987 [52743] 
939987 [52744] He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the
939987 [52745] very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would
939987 [52746] be solved.
939987 [52747] 
939987 [52748] "Now I can explain it all to myself," said Raskolnikov, addressing
939987 [52749] Lebeziatnikov. "From the very beginning of the business, I suspected
939987 [52750] that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began
939987 [52751] to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which
939987 [52752] I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your
939987 [52753] valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,
939987 [52754] all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently
939987 [52755] engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna
939987 [52756] Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day
939987 [52757] before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I
939987 [52758] have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day
939987 [52759] before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,
939987 [52760] and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before
939987 [52761] yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,
939987 [52762] as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to
939987 [52763] my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not
939987 [52764] to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most
939987 [52765] contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,
939987 [52766] hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you
939987 [52767] understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,
939987 [52768] by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money
939987 [52769] which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,
939987 [52770] before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had
939987 [52771] given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya
939987 [52772] Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had
939987 [52773] never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,
939987 [52774] Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya
939987 [52775] Semyonovna's little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his
939987 [52776] question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I
939987 [52777] answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother
939987 [52778] and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he
939987 [52779] gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took
939987 [52780] place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday
939987 [52781] evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now
939987 [52782] succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would
939987 [52783] have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his
939987 [52784] suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on
939987 [52785] a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting
939987 [52786] and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might
939987 [52787] even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,
939987 [52788] and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing
939987 [52789] of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing
939987 [52790] that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to
939987 [52791] me. That was what he was working for! That's how I understand it. That's
939987 [52792] the whole reason for it and there can be no other!"
939987 [52793] 
939987 [52794] It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his
939987 [52795] speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by
939987 [52796] exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke
939987 [52797] clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of
939987 [52798] conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
939987 [52799] 
939987 [52800] "Yes, yes, that's it," Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, "that must be
939987 [52801] it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,
939987 [52802] whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna's
939987 [52803] guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was
939987 [52804] essential for him that you should be here! That's it, that's it!"
939987 [52805] 
939987 [52806] Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He
939987 [52807] seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have
939987 [52808] been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this
939987 [52809] was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of
939987 [52810] the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had
939987 [52811] already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The
939987 [52812] commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,
939987 [52813] was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very
939987 [52814] unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came
939987 [52815] in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited
939987 [52816] and were continually shouting at him: "The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!" and
939987 [52817] muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained
939987 [52818] attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as
939987 [52819] though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her
939987 [52820] eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina
939987 [52821] Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.
939987 [52822] Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth
939987 [52823] wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr
939987 [52824] Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.
939987 [52825] 
939987 [52826] Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.
939987 [52827] Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
939987 [52828] But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of
939987 [52829] Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:
939987 [52830] 
939987 [52831] "Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don't squeeze, let me pass!" he said,
939987 [52832] making his way through the crowd. "And no threats, if you please! I
939987 [52833] assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the
939987 [52834] contrary, you'll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing
939987 [52835] the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I
939987 [52836] shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and
939987 [52837] will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and
939987 [52838] atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are
939987 [52839] foolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!"
939987 [52840] 
939987 [52841] "Don't let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and
939987 [52842] everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I've
939987 [52843] been taking, the way I've been expounding... all this fortnight!"
939987 [52844] 
939987 [52845] "I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;
939987 [52846] now I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor
939987 [52847] for your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!"
939987 [52848] 
939987 [52849] He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to
939987 [52850] let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished
939987 [52851] it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew
939987 [52852] straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,
939987 [52853] fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room
939987 [52854] and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had
939987 [52855] felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than
939987 [52856] anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that
939987 [52857] moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,
939987 [52858] gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was
939987 [52859] too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without
939987 [52860] murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too
939987 [52861] bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first
939987 [52862] terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all
939987 [52863] clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
939987 [52864] made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical
939987 [52865] weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room
939987 [52866] and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin's departure. When amidst
939987 [52867] loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the
939987 [52868] landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina
939987 [52869] Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.
939987 [52870] 
939987 [52871] "Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!"
939987 [52872] 
939987 [52873] And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay
939987 [52874] her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the
939987 [52875] floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,
939987 [52876] jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at
939987 [52877] Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her
939987 [52878] away like a feather.
939987 [52879] 
939987 [52880] "What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature
939987 [52881] attacks me! What! On the day of my husband's funeral I am turned out of
939987 [52882] my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,
939987 [52883] with my orphans! Where am I to go?" wailed the poor woman, sobbing and
939987 [52884] gasping. "Good God!" she cried with flashing eyes, "is there no justice
939987 [52885] upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!
939987 [52886] There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,
939987 [52887] godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I'll come back. Wait
939987 [52888] for me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is
939987 [52889] justice on earth!"
939987 [52890] 
939987 [52891] And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had
939987 [52892] mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the
939987 [52893] disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,
939987 [52894] wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention
939987 [52895] of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little
939987 [52896] ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the
939987 [52897] room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia
939987 [52898] Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing
939987 [52899] everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked
939987 [52900] incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had
939987 [52901] happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others
939987 [52902] struck up a song....
939987 [52903] 
939987 [52904] "Now it's time for me to go," thought Raskolnikov. "Well, Sofya
939987 [52905] Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!"
939987 [52906] 
939987 [52907] And he set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings.
939987 [52908] 
939987 [52909] 
939987 [52910] 
939987 [52911] CHAPTER IV
939987 [52912] 
939987 [52913] Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against
939987 [52914] Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own
939987 [52915] heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort
939987 [52916] of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal
939987 [52917] feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,
939987 [52918] especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview
939987 [52919] with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the
939987 [52920] terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the
939987 [52921] thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna's, "Well,
939987 [52922] Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!" he was still
939987 [52923] superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over
939987 [52924] Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia's lodging, he
939987 [52925] felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the
939987 [52926] door, asking himself the strange question: "Must he tell her who killed
939987 [52927] Lizaveta?" It was a strange question because he felt at the very time
939987 [52928] not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could
939987 [52929] not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he
939987 [52930] only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before
939987 [52931] the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and
939987 [52932] suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the
939987 [52933] doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in
939987 [52934] her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet
939987 [52935] him as though she were expecting him.
939987 [52936] 
939987 [52937] "What would have become of me but for you?" she said quickly, meeting
939987 [52938] him in the middle of the room.
939987 [52939] 
939987 [52940] Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been
939987 [52941] waiting for.
939987 [52942] 
939987 [52943] Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she
939987 [52944] had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she
939987 [52945] had done the day before.
939987 [52946] 
939987 [52947] "Well, Sonia?" he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, "it was
939987 [52948] all due to 'your social position and the habits associated with it.' Did
939987 [52949] you understand that just now?"
939987 [52950] 
939987 [52951] Her face showed her distress.
939987 [52952] 
939987 [52953] "Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday," she interrupted him.
939987 [52954] "Please don't begin it. There is misery enough without that."
939987 [52955] 
939987 [52956] She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.
939987 [52957] 
939987 [52958] "I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I
939987 [52959] wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come."
939987 [52960] 
939987 [52961] He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging
939987 [52962] and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere "to seek justice."
939987 [52963] 
939987 [52964] "My God!" cried Sonia, "let's go at once...."
939987 [52965] 
939987 [52966] And she snatched up her cape.
939987 [52967] 
939987 [52968] "It's everlastingly the same thing!" said Raskolnikov, irritably.
939987 [52969] "You've no thought except for them! Stay a little with me."
939987 [52970] 
939987 [52971] "But... Katerina Ivanovna?"
939987 [52972] 
939987 [52973] "You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she'll come to you
939987 [52974] herself since she has run out," he added peevishly. "If she doesn't find
939987 [52975] you here, you'll be blamed for it...."
939987 [52976] 
939987 [52977] Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at
939987 [52978] the floor and deliberating.
939987 [52979] 
939987 [52980] "This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you," he began, not looking
939987 [52981] at Sonia, "but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would
939987 [52982] have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.
939987 [52983] Ah?"
939987 [52984] 
939987 [52985] "Yes," she assented in a faint voice. "Yes," she repeated, preoccupied
939987 [52986] and distressed.
939987 [52987] 
939987 [52988] "But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
939987 [52989] Lebeziatnikov's turning up."
939987 [52990] 
939987 [52991] Sonia was silent.
939987 [52992] 
939987 [52993] "And if you'd gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said
939987 [52994] yesterday?"
939987 [52995] 
939987 [52996] Again she did not answer. He waited.
939987 [52997] 
939987 [52998] "I thought you would cry out again 'don't speak of it, leave off.'"
939987 [52999] Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. "What, silence
939987 [53000] again?" he asked a minute later. "We must talk about something, you
939987 [53001] know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a
939987 [53002] certain 'problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say." (He was beginning to lose
939987 [53003] the thread.) "No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had
939987 [53004] known all Luzhin's intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,
939987 [53005] that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and
939987 [53006] yourself thrown in--since you don't count yourself for anything--Polenka
939987 [53007] too... for she'll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on
939987 [53008] your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether
939987 [53009] Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna
939987 [53010] should die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?"
939987 [53011] 
939987 [53012] Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this
939987 [53013] hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout
939987 [53014] way.
939987 [53015] 
939987 [53016] "I felt that you were going to ask some question like that," she said,
939987 [53017] looking inquisitively at him.
939987 [53018] 
939987 [53019] "I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?"
939987 [53020] 
939987 [53021] "Why do you ask about what could not happen?" said Sonia reluctantly.
939987 [53022] 
939987 [53023] "Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked
939987 [53024] things? You haven't dared to decide even that!"
939987 [53025] 
939987 [53026] "But I can't know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what
939987 [53027] can't be answered? What's the use of such foolish questions? How could
939987 [53028] it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge
939987 [53029] to decide who is to live and who is not to live?"
939987 [53030] 
939987 [53031] "Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing
939987 [53032] anything," Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
939987 [53033] 
939987 [53034] "You'd better say straight out what you want!" Sonia cried in distress.
939987 [53035] "You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to
939987 [53036] torture me?"
939987 [53037] 
939987 [53038] She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at
939987 [53039] her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.
939987 [53040] 
939987 [53041] "Of course you're right, Sonia," he said softly at last. He was suddenly
939987 [53042] changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
939987 [53043] Even his voice was suddenly weak. "I told you yesterday that I was not
939987 [53044] coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to ask
939987 [53045] forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.
939987 [53046] I was asking forgiveness, Sonia...."
939987 [53047] 
939987 [53048] He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in
939987 [53049] his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.
939987 [53050] 
939987 [53051] And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred
939987 [53052] for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened
939987 [53053] of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he
939987 [53054] met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was
939987 [53055] love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real
939987 [53056] feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that
939987 [53057] _that_ minute had come.
939987 [53058] 
939987 [53059] He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he
939987 [53060] turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without
939987 [53061] uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.
939987 [53062] 
939987 [53063] His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had
939987 [53064] stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that "he must
939987 [53065] not lose another minute."
939987 [53066] 
939987 [53067] "What's the matter?" asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.
939987 [53068] 
939987 [53069] He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he
939987 [53070] had intended to "tell" and he did not understand what was happening to
939987 [53071] him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and
939987 [53072] waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It
939987 [53073] was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,
939987 [53074] helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed
939987 [53075] through Sonia's heart.
939987 [53076] 
939987 [53077] "What's the matter?" she repeated, drawing a little away from him.
939987 [53078] 
939987 [53079] "Nothing, Sonia, don't be frightened.... It's nonsense. It really is
939987 [53080] nonsense, if you think of it," he muttered, like a man in delirium. "Why
939987 [53081] have I come to torture you?" he added suddenly, looking at her. "Why,
939987 [53082] really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia...."
939987 [53083] 
939987 [53084] He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour
939987 [53085] before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and
939987 [53086] feeling a continual tremor all over.
939987 [53087] 
939987 [53088] "Oh, how you are suffering!" she muttered in distress, looking intently
939987 [53089] at him.
939987 [53090] 
939987 [53091] "It's all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia." He suddenly smiled, a pale
939987 [53092] helpless smile for two seconds. "You remember what I meant to tell you
939987 [53093] yesterday?"
939987 [53094] 
939987 [53095] Sonia waited uneasily.
939987 [53096] 
939987 [53097] "I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but
939987 [53098] that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta."
939987 [53099] 
939987 [53100] She began trembling all over.
939987 [53101] 
939987 [53102] "Well, here I've come to tell you."
939987 [53103] 
939987 [53104] "Then you really meant it yesterday?" she whispered with difficulty.
939987 [53105] "How do you know?" she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her
939987 [53106] reason.
939987 [53107] 
939987 [53108] Sonia's face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.
939987 [53109] 
939987 [53110] "I know."
939987 [53111] 
939987 [53112] She paused a minute.
939987 [53113] 
939987 [53114] "Have they found him?" she asked timidly.
939987 [53115] 
939987 [53116] "No."
939987 [53117] 
939987 [53118] "Then how do you know about _it_?" she asked again, hardly audibly and
939987 [53119] again after a minute's pause.
939987 [53120] 
939987 [53121] He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
939987 [53122] 
939987 [53123] "Guess," he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.
939987 [53124] 
939987 [53125] A shudder passed over her.
939987 [53126] 
939987 [53127] "But you... why do you frighten me like this?" she said, smiling like a
939987 [53128] child.
939987 [53129] 
939987 [53130] "I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know," Raskolnikov went
939987 [53131] on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes
939987 [53132] away. "He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her
939987 [53133] accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and
939987 [53134] he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too."
939987 [53135] 
939987 [53136] Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.
939987 [53137] 
939987 [53138] "You can't guess, then?" he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were
939987 [53139] flinging himself down from a steeple.
939987 [53140] 
939987 [53141] "N-no..." whispered Sonia.
939987 [53142] 
939987 [53143] "Take a good look."
939987 [53144] 
939987 [53145] As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his
939987 [53146] heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the
939987 [53147] face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta's
939987 [53148] face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the
939987 [53149] wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking
939987 [53150] as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,
939987 [53151] looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and
939987 [53152] holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same
939987 [53153] thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same
939987 [53154] terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left
939987 [53155] hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to
939987 [53156] get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed
939987 [53157] even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear
939987 [53158] showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost
939987 [53159] with the same _childish_ smile.
939987 [53160] 
939987 [53161] "Have you guessed?" he whispered at last.
939987 [53162] 
939987 [53163] "Good God!" broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
939987 [53164] 
939987 [53165] She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a
939987 [53166] moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands
939987 [53167] and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his
939987 [53168] face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she
939987 [53169] tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;
939987 [53170] there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when
939987 [53171] she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she
939987 [53172] had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for
939987 [53173] instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as
939987 [53174] soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen
939987 [53175] this very thing.
939987 [53176] 
939987 [53177] "Stop, Sonia, enough! don't torture me," he begged her miserably.
939987 [53178] 
939987 [53179] It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,
939987 [53180] but this is how it happened.
939987 [53181] 
939987 [53182] She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her
939987 [53183] hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat
939987 [53184] down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden
939987 [53185] she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on
939987 [53186] her knees before him, she did not know why.
939987 [53187] 
939987 [53188] "What have you done--what have you done to yourself?" she said in
939987 [53189] despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms
939987 [53190] round him, and held him tightly.
939987 [53191] 
939987 [53192] Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.
939987 [53193] 
939987 [53194] "You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you
939987 [53195] about that.... You don't think what you are doing."
939987 [53196] 
939987 [53197] "There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!" she
939987 [53198] cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into
939987 [53199] violent hysterical weeping.
939987 [53200] 
939987 [53201] A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at
939987 [53202] once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes
939987 [53203] and hung on his eyelashes.
939987 [53204] 
939987 [53205] "Then you won't leave me, Sonia?" he said, looking at her almost with
939987 [53206] hope.
939987 [53207] 
939987 [53208] "No, no, never, nowhere!" cried Sonia. "I will follow you, I will follow
939987 [53209] you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn't I
939987 [53210] know you before! Why didn't you come before? Oh, dear!"
939987 [53211] 
939987 [53212] "Here I have come."
939987 [53213] 
939987 [53214] "Yes, now! What's to be done now?... Together, together!" she repeated
939987 [53215] as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. "I'll follow you to
939987 [53216] Siberia!"
939987 [53217] 
939987 [53218] He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to
939987 [53219] his lips.
939987 [53220] 
939987 [53221] "Perhaps I don't want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia," he said.
939987 [53222] 
939987 [53223] Sonia looked at him quickly.
939987 [53224] 
939987 [53225] Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man
939987 [53226] the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she
939987 [53227] seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She
939987 [53228] knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all
939987 [53229] these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not
939987 [53230] believe it: "He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?"
939987 [53231] 
939987 [53232] "What's the meaning of it? Where am I?" she said in complete
939987 [53233] bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. "How could you,
939987 [53234] you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does
939987 [53235] it mean?"
939987 [53236] 
939987 [53237] "Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia," he answered wearily, almost
939987 [53238] with vexation.
939987 [53239] 
939987 [53240] Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:
939987 [53241] 
939987 [53242] "You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?"
939987 [53243] 
939987 [53244] "No, Sonia, no," he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. "I was
939987 [53245] not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that's
939987 [53246] not the real thing either.... Don't torture me, Sonia."
939987 [53247] 
939987 [53248] Sonia clasped her hands.
939987 [53249] 
939987 [53250] "Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could
939987 [53251] believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet
939987 [53252] rob and murder! Ah," she cried suddenly, "that money you gave Katerina
939987 [53253] Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money..."
939987 [53254] 
939987 [53255] "No, Sonia," he broke in hurriedly, "that money was not it. Don't worry
939987 [53256] yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the
939987 [53257] day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....
939987 [53258] That money was mine--my own."
939987 [53259] 
939987 [53260] Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.
939987 [53261] 
939987 [53262] "And _that_ money.... I don't even know really whether there was any
939987 [53263] money," he added softly, as though reflecting. "I took a purse off her
939987 [53264] neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...
939987 [53265] but I didn't look in it; I suppose I hadn't time.... And the
939987 [53266] things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next
939987 [53267] morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now...."
939987 [53268] 
939987 [53269] Sonia strained every nerve to listen.
939987 [53270] 
939987 [53271] "Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?" she
939987 [53272] asked quickly, catching at a straw.
939987 [53273] 
939987 [53274] "I don't know.... I haven't yet decided whether to take that money or
939987 [53275] not," he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he
939987 [53276] gave a brief ironical smile. "Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?"
939987 [53277] 
939987 [53278] The thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he mad? But she
939987 [53279] dismissed it at once. "No, it was something else." She could make
939987 [53280] nothing of it, nothing.
939987 [53281] 
939987 [53282] "Do you know, Sonia," he said suddenly with conviction, "let me tell
939987 [53283] you: if I'd simply killed because I was hungry," laying stress on
939987 [53284] every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, "I should
939987 [53285] be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you," he
939987 [53286] cried a moment later with a sort of despair, "what would it matter to
939987 [53287] you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such
939987 [53288] a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've come to you
939987 [53289] to-day?"
939987 [53290] 
939987 [53291] Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
939987 [53292] 
939987 [53293] "I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left."
939987 [53294] 
939987 [53295] "Go where?" asked Sonia timidly.
939987 [53296] 
939987 [53297] "Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious," he smiled bitterly.
939987 [53298] "We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it's only now, only this
939987 [53299] moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!
939987 [53300] Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one
939987 [53301] thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won't leave me,
939987 [53302] Sonia?"
939987 [53303] 
939987 [53304] She squeezed his hand.
939987 [53305] 
939987 [53306] "And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?" he cried a minute
939987 [53307] later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. "Here you expect
939987 [53308] an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see
939987 [53309] that. But what can I tell you? You won't understand and will only suffer
939987 [53310] misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.
939987 [53311] Why do you do it? Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come to
939987 [53312] throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can
939987 [53313] you love such a mean wretch?"
939987 [53314] 
939987 [53315] "But aren't you suffering, too?" cried Sonia.
939987 [53316] 
939987 [53317] Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an
939987 [53318] instant softened it.
939987 [53319] 
939987 [53320] "Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great
939987 [53321] deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn't have
939987 [53322] come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That's
939987 [53323] not the point. I must speak now, but I don't know how to begin."
939987 [53324] 
939987 [53325] He paused and sank into thought.
939987 [53326] 
939987 [53327] "Ach, we are so different," he cried again, "we are not alike. And why,
939987 [53328] why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that."
939987 [53329] 
939987 [53330] "No, no, it was a good thing you came," cried Sonia. "It's better I
939987 [53331] should know, far better!"
939987 [53332] 
939987 [53333] He looked at her with anguish.
939987 [53334] 
939987 [53335] "What if it were really that?" he said, as though reaching a conclusion.
939987 [53336] "Yes, that's what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I
939987 [53337] killed her.... Do you understand now?"
939987 [53338] 
939987 [53339] "N-no," Sonia whispered naÃ¯vely and timidly. "Only speak, speak, I shall
939987 [53340] understand, I shall understand _in myself_!" she kept begging him.
939987 [53341] 
939987 [53342] "You'll understand? Very well, we shall see!" He paused and was for some
939987 [53343] time lost in meditation.
939987 [53344] 
939987 [53345] "It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if
939987 [53346] Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had
939987 [53347] not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his
939987 [53348] career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,
939987 [53349] there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had
939987 [53350] to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you
939987 [53351] understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had
939987 [53352] been no other means? Wouldn't he have felt a pang at its being so far
939987 [53353] from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I
939987 [53354] worried myself fearfully over that 'question' so that I was awfully
939987 [53355] ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would
939987 [53356] not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck
939987 [53357] him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there
939987 [53358] was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,
939987 [53359] he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!
939987 [53360] Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following
939987 [53361] his example. And that's exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,
939987 [53362] Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that's just how it
939987 [53363] was."
939987 [53364] 
939987 [53365] Sonia did not think it at all funny.
939987 [53366] 
939987 [53367] "You had better tell me straight out... without examples," she begged,
939987 [53368] still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
939987 [53369] 
939987 [53370] He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.
939987 [53371] 
939987 [53372] "You are right again, Sonia. Of course that's all nonsense, it's almost
939987 [53373] all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely
939987 [53374] anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned
939987 [53375] to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a
939987 [53376] student, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forced
939987 [53377] for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten
939987 [53378] or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or
939987 [53379] clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles" (he repeated it as though it
939987 [53380] were a lesson) "and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief
939987 [53381] and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my
939987 [53382] sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it's a hard
939987 [53383] thing to pass everything by all one's life, to turn one's back upon
939987 [53384] everything, to forget one's mother and decorously accept the insults
939987 [53385] inflicted on one's sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to
939987 [53386] burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again
939987 [53387] without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman's
939987 [53388] money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,
939987 [53389] to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving
939987 [53390] it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up
939987 [53391] a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
939987 [53392] Well... that's all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did
939987 [53393] wrong.... Well, that's enough."
939987 [53394] 
939987 [53395] He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head
939987 [53396] sink.
939987 [53397] 
939987 [53398] "Oh, that's not it, that's not it," Sonia cried in distress. "How could
939987 [53399] one... no, that's not right, not right."
939987 [53400] 
939987 [53401] "You see yourself that it's not right. But I've spoken truly, it's the
939987 [53402] truth."
939987 [53403] 
939987 [53404] "As though that could be the truth! Good God!"
939987 [53405] 
939987 [53406] "I've only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful
939987 [53407] creature."
939987 [53408] 
939987 [53409] "A human being--a louse!"
939987 [53410] 
939987 [53411] "I too know it wasn't a louse," he answered, looking strangely at
939987 [53412] her. "But I am talking nonsense, Sonia," he added. "I've been talking
939987 [53413] nonsense a long time.... That's not it, you are right there. There were
939987 [53414] quite, quite other causes for it! I haven't talked to anyone for so
939987 [53415] long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now."
939987 [53416] 
939987 [53417] His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an
939987 [53418] uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen
939987 [53419] through his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too
939987 [53420] was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow
939987 [53421] comprehensible, but yet... "But how, how! Good God!" And she wrung her
939987 [53422] hands in despair.
939987 [53423] 
939987 [53424] "No, Sonia, that's not it," he began again suddenly, raising his head,
939987 [53425] as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were
939987 [53426] roused him--"that's not it! Better... imagine--yes, it's certainly
939987 [53427] better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive
939987 [53428] and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let's have it all out
939987 [53429] at once! They've talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just
939987 [53430] now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that
939987 [53431] perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed
939987 [53432] for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,
939987 [53433] no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I
939987 [53434] turned sulky and wouldn't. (Yes, sulkiness, that's the right word for
939987 [53435] it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You've been in my den, you've seen
939987 [53436] it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp
939987 [53437] the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn't
939987 [53438] go out of it! I wouldn't on purpose! I didn't go out for days together,
939987 [53439] and I wouldn't work, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doing
939987 [53440] nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn't, I
939987 [53441] went all day without; I wouldn't ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At
939987 [53442] night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn't earn money for
939987 [53443] candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies
939987 [53444] an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and
939987 [53445] thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange
939987 [53446] dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy
939987 [53447] that... No, that's not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept
939987 [53448] asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I
939987 [53449] know they are--yet I won't be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one
939987 [53450] waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I
939987 [53451] understood that that would never come to pass, that men won't change and
939987 [53452] that nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it.
939987 [53453] Yes, that's so. That's the law of their nature, Sonia,... that's so!...
939987 [53454] And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will
939987 [53455] have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their
939987 [53456] eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he
939987 [53457] who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now
939987 [53458] and so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!"
939987 [53459] 
939987 [53460] Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared
939987 [53461] whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he
939987 [53462] was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without
939987 [53463] talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his
939987 [53464] faith and code.
939987 [53465] 
939987 [53466] "I divined then, Sonia," he went on eagerly, "that power is only
939987 [53467] vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only
939987 [53468] one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first
939987 [53469] time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever
939987 [53470] thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is
939987 [53471] that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to
939987 [53472] go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted
939987 [53473] _to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the
939987 [53474] daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!"
939987 [53475] 
939987 [53476] "Oh hush, hush," cried Sonia, clasping her hands. "You turned away from
939987 [53477] God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!"
939987 [53478] 
939987 [53479] "Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became
939987 [53480] clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?"
939987 [53481] 
939987 [53482] "Hush, don't laugh, blasphemer! You don't understand, you don't
939987 [53483] understand! Oh God! He won't understand!"
939987 [53484] 
939987 [53485] "Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil
939987 [53486] leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!" he repeated with gloomy insistence. "I
939987 [53487] know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all
939987 [53488] over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I've argued it all over with
939987 [53489] myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how
939987 [53490] sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it
939987 [53491] and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don't
939987 [53492] suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a
939987 [53493] wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn't suppose that
939987 [53494] I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether
939987 [53495] I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn't the right--or that if
939987 [53496] I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't
939987 [53497] so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his
939987 [53498] goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,
939987 [53499] wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly
939987 [53500] of course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that
939987 [53501] battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder
939987 [53502] without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn't
939987 [53503] want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I did
939987 [53504] the murder--that's nonsense--I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and
939987 [53505] power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;
939987 [53506] I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a
939987 [53507] benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in
939987 [53508] my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that
939987 [53509] moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It
939987 [53510] was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all
939987 [53511] now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder
939987 [53512] again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led
939987 [53513] me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse
939987 [53514] like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or
939987 [53515] not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling
939987 [53516] creature or whether I have the _right_..."
939987 [53517] 
939987 [53518] "To kill? Have the right to kill?" Sonia clasped her hands.
939987 [53519] 
939987 [53520] "Ach, Sonia!" he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,
939987 [53521] but was contemptuously silent. "Don't interrupt me, Sonia. I want to
939987 [53522] prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me
939987 [53523] since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such
939987 [53524] a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I've come to you
939987 [53525] now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to
939987 [53526] you? Listen: when I went then to the old woman's I only went to
939987 [53527] _try_.... You may be sure of that!"
939987 [53528] 
939987 [53529] "And you murdered her!"
939987 [53530] 
939987 [53531] "But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to
939987 [53532] commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!
939987 [53533] Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself
939987 [53534] once for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old
939987 [53535] woman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!" he cried in a
939987 [53536] sudden spasm of agony, "let me be!"
939987 [53537] 
939987 [53538] He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as
939987 [53539] in a vise.
939987 [53540] 
939987 [53541] "What suffering!" A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.
939987 [53542] 
939987 [53543] "Well, what am I to do now?" he asked, suddenly raising his head and
939987 [53544] looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.
939987 [53545] 
939987 [53546] "What are you to do?" she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been
939987 [53547] full of tears suddenly began to shine. "Stand up!" (She seized him by
939987 [53548] the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) "Go at once,
939987 [53549] this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the
939987 [53550] earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say
939987 [53551] to all men aloud, 'I am a murderer!' Then God will send you life again.
939987 [53552] Will you go, will you go?" she asked him, trembling all over, snatching
939987 [53553] his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes
939987 [53554] full of fire.
939987 [53555] 
939987 [53556] He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
939987 [53557] 
939987 [53558] "You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?" he asked gloomily.
939987 [53559] 
939987 [53560] "Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that's what you must do."
939987 [53561] 
939987 [53562] "No! I am not going to them, Sonia!"
939987 [53563] 
939987 [53564] "But how will you go on living? What will you live for?" cried Sonia,
939987 [53565] "how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what
939987 [53566] will become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your
939987 [53567] mother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,
939987 [53568] God!" she cried, "why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by
939987 [53569] himself! What will become of you now?"
939987 [53570] 
939987 [53571] "Don't be a child, Sonia," he said softly. "What wrong have I done
939987 [53572] them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That's only a
939987 [53573] phantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a
939987 [53574] virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.
939987 [53575] And what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to
939987 [53576] take the money and hid it under a stone?" he added with a bitter smile.
939987 [53577] "Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting
939987 [53578] it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn't understand and they don't deserve
939987 [53579] to understand. Why should I go to them? I won't. Don't be a child,
939987 [53580] Sonia...."
939987 [53581] 
939987 [53582] "It will be too much for you to bear, too much!" she repeated, holding
939987 [53583] out her hands in despairing supplication.
939987 [53584] 
939987 [53585] "Perhaps I've been unfair to myself," he observed gloomily, pondering,
939987 [53586] "perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I've been in too great
939987 [53587] a hurry to condemn myself. I'll make another fight for it."
939987 [53588] 
939987 [53589] A haughty smile appeared on his lips.
939987 [53590] 
939987 [53591] "What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!"
939987 [53592] 
939987 [53593] "I shall get used to it," he said grimly and thoughtfully. "Listen," he
939987 [53594] began a minute later, "stop crying, it's time to talk of the facts: I've
939987 [53595] come to tell you that the police are after me, on my track...."
939987 [53596] 
939987 [53597] "Ach!" Sonia cried in terror.
939987 [53598] 
939987 [53599] "Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are
939987 [53600] frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall
939987 [53601] make a struggle for it and they won't do anything to me. They've no real
939987 [53602] evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but
939987 [53603] to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained
939987 [53604] two ways, that's to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do
939987 [53605] you understand? And I shall, for I've learnt my lesson. But they will
939987 [53606] certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,
939987 [53607] they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will
939987 [53608] arrest me to-day.... But that's no matter, Sonia; they'll let me out
939987 [53609] again... for there isn't any real proof against me, and there won't be,
939987 [53610] I give you my word for it. And they can't convict a man on what they
939987 [53611] have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will
939987 [53612] try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they
939987 [53613] won't be frightened.... My sister's future is secure, however, now, I
939987 [53614] believe... and my mother's must be too.... Well, that's all. Be careful,
939987 [53615] though. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?"
939987 [53616] 
939987 [53617] "Oh, I will, I will."
939987 [53618] 
939987 [53619] They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had
939987 [53620] been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at
939987 [53621] Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he
939987 [53622] felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a
939987 [53623] strange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that
939987 [53624] all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part
939987 [53625] of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he
939987 [53626] suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.
939987 [53627] 
939987 [53628] "Sonia," he said, "you'd better not come and see me when I am in
939987 [53629] prison."
939987 [53630] 
939987 [53631] Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.
939987 [53632] 
939987 [53633] "Have you a cross on you?" she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.
939987 [53634] 
939987 [53635] He did not at first understand the question.
939987 [53636] 
939987 [53637] "No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have
939987 [53638] another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with
939987 [53639] Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will
939987 [53640] wear Lizaveta's now and give you this. Take it... it's mine! It's mine,
939987 [53641] you know," she begged him. "We will go to suffer together, and together
939987 [53642] we will bear our cross!"
939987 [53643] 
939987 [53644] "Give it me," said Raskolnikov.
939987 [53645] 
939987 [53646] He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the
939987 [53647] hand he held out for the cross.
939987 [53648] 
939987 [53649] "Not now, Sonia. Better later," he added to comfort her.
939987 [53650] 
939987 [53651] "Yes, yes, better," she repeated with conviction, "when you go to meet
939987 [53652] your suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I'll put it on you,
939987 [53653] we will pray and go together."
939987 [53654] 
939987 [53655] At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.
939987 [53656] 
939987 [53657] "Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?" they heard in a very familiar and
939987 [53658] polite voice.
939987 [53659] 
939987 [53660] Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.
939987 [53661] Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.
939987 [53662] 
939987 [53663] 
939987 [53664] 
939987 [53665] CHAPTER V
939987 [53666] 
939987 [53667] Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
939987 [53668] 
939987 [53669] "I've come to you, Sofya Semyonovna," he began. "Excuse me... I thought
939987 [53670] I should find you," he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, "that is,
939987 [53671] I didn't mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina
939987 [53672] Ivanovna has gone out of her mind," he blurted out suddenly, turning
939987 [53673] from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
939987 [53674] 
939987 [53675] Sonia screamed.
939987 [53676] 
939987 [53677] "At least it seems so. But... we don't know what to do, you see! She
939987 [53678] came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps
939987 [53679] beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father's former
939987 [53680] chief, she didn't find him at home: he was dining at some other
939987 [53681] general's.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general's,
939987 [53682] and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to
939987 [53683] see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what
939987 [53684] happened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own
939987 [53685] story, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe
939987 [53686] it.... How it is she wasn't taken up, I can't understand! Now she is
939987 [53687] telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it's difficult to
939987 [53688] understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,
939987 [53689] she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the
939987 [53690] children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children
939987 [53691] will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every
939987 [53692] day under the general's window... 'to let everyone see well-born
939987 [53693] children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.' She
939987 [53694] keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida
939987 [53695] to sing 'My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing
939987 [53696] up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means
939987 [53697] to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won't
939987 [53698] listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It's beyond
939987 [53699] anything!"
939987 [53700] 
939987 [53701] Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost
939987 [53702] breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,
939987 [53703] putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and
939987 [53704] Lebeziatnikov came after him.
939987 [53705] 
939987 [53706] "She has certainly gone mad!" he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out
939987 [53707] into the street. "I didn't want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said
939987 [53708] 'it seemed like it,' but there isn't a doubt of it. They say that in
939987 [53709] consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity I
939987 [53710] know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn't
939987 [53711] listen."
939987 [53712] 
939987 [53713] "Did you talk to her about the tubercles?"
939987 [53714] 
939987 [53715] "Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn't have understood!
939987 [53716] But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he
939987 [53717] has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying. That's clear. Is it your
939987 [53718] conviction that he won't?"
939987 [53719] 
939987 [53720] "Life would be too easy if it were so," answered Raskolnikov.
939987 [53721] 
939987 [53722] "Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for
939987 [53723] Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have
939987 [53724] been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the
939987 [53725] insane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific
939987 [53726] man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such
939987 [53727] treatment. His idea was that there's nothing really wrong with the
939987 [53728] physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a
939987 [53729] logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He
939987 [53730] gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they
939987 [53731] say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far
939987 [53732] success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at
939987 [53733] least."
939987 [53734] 
939987 [53735] Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he
939987 [53736] lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov
939987 [53737] woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.
939987 [53738] 
939987 [53739] Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle
939987 [53740] of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered
939987 [53741] paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous
939987 [53742] knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose
939987 [53743] on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of
939987 [53744] absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was
939987 [53745] hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the
939987 [53746] window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out
939987 [53747] of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down
939987 [53748] on the sofa.
939987 [53749] 
939987 [53750] Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
939987 [53751] 
939987 [53752] Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now
939987 [53753] that he had made her more miserable.
939987 [53754] 
939987 [53755] "Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison
939987 [53756] her life? Oh, the meanness of it!"
939987 [53757] 
939987 [53758] "I will remain alone," he said resolutely, "and she shall not come to
939987 [53759] the prison!"
939987 [53760] 
939987 [53761] Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a
939987 [53762] strange thought.
939987 [53763] 
939987 [53764] "Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia," he thought suddenly.
939987 [53765] 
939987 [53766] He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging
939987 [53767] through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At
939987 [53768] first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he
939987 [53769] had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place
939987 [53770] as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost
939987 [53771] vacantly at her.
939987 [53772] 
939987 [53773] "Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one minute," said Dounia.
939987 [53774] 
939987 [53775] Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.
939987 [53776] He saw that she too had come to him with love.
939987 [53777] 
939987 [53778] "Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and
939987 [53779] told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a
939987 [53780] stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that
939987 [53781] there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such
939987 [53782] horror. I don't think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must
939987 [53783] be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That's
939987 [53784] what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don't
939987 [53785] judge you, I don't venture to judge you, and forgive me for having
939987 [53786] blamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,
939987 [53787] should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,
939987 [53788] but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that
939987 [53789] you will come very soon. Don't worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at
939987 [53790] rest; but don't you try her too much--come once at least; remember that
939987 [53791] she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say" (Dounia began
939987 [53792] to get up) "that if you should need me or should need... all my life or
939987 [53793] anything... call me, and I'll come. Good-bye!"
939987 [53794] 
939987 [53795] She turned abruptly and went towards the door.
939987 [53796] 
939987 [53797] "Dounia!" Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. "That Razumihin,
939987 [53798] Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow."
939987 [53799] 
939987 [53800] Dounia flushed slightly.
939987 [53801] 
939987 [53802] "Well?" she asked, waiting a moment.
939987 [53803] 
939987 [53804] "He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....
939987 [53805] Good-bye, Dounia."
939987 [53806] 
939987 [53807] Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
939987 [53808] 
939987 [53809] "But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that
939987 [53810] you... give me such a parting message?"
939987 [53811] 
939987 [53812] "Never mind.... Good-bye."
939987 [53813] 
939987 [53814] He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at
939987 [53815] him uneasily, and went out troubled.
939987 [53816] 
939987 [53817] No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)
939987 [53818] when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,
939987 [53819] and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.
939987 [53820] 
939987 [53821] "Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and
939987 [53822] will feel that I stole her kiss."
939987 [53823] 
939987 [53824] "And would _she_ stand that test?" he went on a few minutes later to
939987 [53825] himself. "No, she wouldn't; girls like that can't stand things! They
939987 [53826] never do."
939987 [53827] 
939987 [53828] And he thought of Sonia.
939987 [53829] 
939987 [53830] There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was
939987 [53831] fading. He took up his cap and went out.
939987 [53832] 
939987 [53833] He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all
939987 [53834] this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And
939987 [53835] if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this
939987 [53836] continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession
939987 [53837] of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.
939987 [53838] 
939987 [53839] He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had
939987 [53840] begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute
939987 [53841] about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;
939987 [53842] it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a
939987 [53843] foretaste of an eternity "on a square yard of space." Towards evening
939987 [53844] this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
939987 [53845] 
939987 [53846] "With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or
939987 [53847] something, one can't help doing something stupid! You'll go to Dounia,
939987 [53848] as well as to Sonia," he muttered bitterly.
939987 [53849] 
939987 [53850] He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to
939987 [53851] him.
939987 [53852] 
939987 [53853] "Only fancy, I've been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she's
939987 [53854] carried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and
939987 [53855] I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making
939987 [53856] the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the
939987 [53857] cross-roads and in front of shops; there's a crowd of fools running
939987 [53858] after them. Come along!"
939987 [53859] 
939987 [53860] "And Sonia?" Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.
939987 [53861] 
939987 [53862] "Simply frantic. That is, it's not Sofya Semyonovna's frantic, but
939987 [53863] Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova's frantic too. But Katerina
939987 [53864] Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They'll be
939987 [53865] taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....
939987 [53866] They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya
939987 [53867] Semyonovna's, quite close."
939987 [53868] 
939987 [53869] On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one
939987 [53870] where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally
939987 [53871] of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could
939987 [53872] be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle
939987 [53873] likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress
939987 [53874] with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way
939987 [53875] on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her
939987 [53876] wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out
939987 [53877] of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
939987 [53878] But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew
939987 [53879] more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed
939987 [53880] them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began
939987 [53881] explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by
939987 [53882] their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the
939987 [53883] crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she
939987 [53884] immediately appealed to him to see what these children "from a genteel,
939987 [53885] one may say aristocratic, house" had been brought to. If she heard
939987 [53886] laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers
939987 [53887] and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their
939987 [53888] heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the
939987 [53889] frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken
939987 [53890] was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of
939987 [53891] rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,
939987 [53892] when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in
939987 [53893] the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,
939987 [53894] which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most
939987 [53895] furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had
939987 [53896] been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The
939987 [53897] boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.
939987 [53898] There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,
939987 [53899] or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with
939987 [53900] a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina
939987 [53901] Ivanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession.
939987 [53902] Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her
939987 [53903] mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her
939987 [53904] mother's condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly
939987 [53905] frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina
939987 [53906] Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina
939987 [53907] Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.
939987 [53908] 
939987 [53909] "Leave off, Sonia, leave off," she shouted, speaking fast, panting and
939987 [53910] coughing. "You don't know what you ask; you are like a child! I've
939987 [53911] told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let
939987 [53912] everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,
939987 [53913] though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in
939987 [53914] truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service." (Katerina
939987 [53915] Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly
939987 [53916] believed it.) "Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,
939987 [53917] Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I
939987 [53918] won't go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?" she cried, seeing
939987 [53919] Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. "Explain to this silly girl, please,
939987 [53920] that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their
939987 [53921] living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are
939987 [53922] an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general
939987 [53923] will lose his post, you'll see! We shall perform under his windows every
939987 [53924] day, and if the Tsar drives by, I'll fall on my knees, put the children
939987 [53925] before me, show them to him, and say 'Defend us father.' He is the
939987 [53926] father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he'll protect us, you'll
939987 [53927] see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,
939987 [53928] you'll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What
939987 [53929] are you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion
939987 [53930] Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What's one to do with
939987 [53931] such children?"
939987 [53932] 
939987 [53933] And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,
939987 [53934] rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried
939987 [53935] to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,
939987 [53936] that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like
939987 [53937] an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a
939987 [53938] boarding-school.
939987 [53939] 
939987 [53940] "A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air," cried Katerina
939987 [53941] Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. "No, Rodion Romanovitch, that
939987 [53942] dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,
939987 [53943] Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing
939987 [53944] in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my
939987 [53945] name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!
939987 [53946] But enough of them, now I'll provide for the children myself, I won't
939987 [53947] bow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!" she pointed
939987 [53948] to Sonia. "Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two
939987 [53949] farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after
939987 [53950] us, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing
939987 [53951] at?" (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) "It's all because Kolya here
939987 [53952] is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?
939987 [53953] Tell me in French, _parlez-moi franÃ§ais_. Why, I've taught you, you know
939987 [53954] some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well
939987 [53955] brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren't
939987 [53956] going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel
939987 [53957] song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,
939987 [53958] but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find
939987 [53959] something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,
939987 [53960] as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it
939987 [53961] over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,
939987 [53962] where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed
939987 [53963] at once. Lida knows 'My Village' only, nothing but 'My Village,' and
939987 [53964] everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,
939987 [53965] have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you'd help your mother!
939987 [53966] My memory's quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really
939987 [53967] can't sing 'An Hussar.' Ah, let us sing in French, 'Cinq sous,' I have
939987 [53968] taught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will
939987 [53969] see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much
939987 [53970] more touching.... You might sing 'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre,'
939987 [53971] for that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the
939987 [53972] aristocratic houses.
939987 [53973] 
939987 [53974] "_Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_..."
939987 [53975] she began singing. "But no, better sing 'Cinq sous.' Now, Kolya, your
939987 [53976] hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other
939987 [53977] way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!
939987 [53978] 
939987 [53979] "_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_."
939987 [53980] 
939987 [53981] (Cough-cough-cough!) "Set your dress straight, Polenka, it's slipped
939987 [53982] down on your shoulders," she observed, panting from coughing. "Now it's
939987 [53983] particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may
939987 [53984] see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice
939987 [53985] should be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,
939987 [53986] with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite
939987 [53987] deformed by it.... Why, you're all crying again! What's the matter,
939987 [53988] stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an
939987 [53989] unbearable child!
939987 [53990] 
939987 [53991] "Cinq sous, cinq sous.
939987 [53992] 
939987 [53993] "A policeman again! What do you want?"
939987 [53994] 
939987 [53995] A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that
939987 [53996] moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking
939987 [53997] official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted
939987 [53998] Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and
939987 [53999] without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore
939987 [54000] a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a
939987 [54001] polite, even ceremonious, bow.
939987 [54002] 
939987 [54003] "I thank you, honoured sir," she began loftily. "The causes that have
939987 [54004] induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and
939987 [54005] honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).
939987 [54006] You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of
939987 [54007] aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating
939987 [54008] grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. 'Your excellency,' I said,
939987 [54009] 'protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,
939987 [54010] and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his
939987 [54011] only daughter.'... That policeman again! Protect me," she cried to the
939987 [54012] official. "Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run
939987 [54013] away from one of them. What do you want, fool?"
939987 [54014] 
939987 [54015] "It's forbidden in the streets. You mustn't make a disturbance."
939987 [54016] 
939987 [54017] "It's you're making a disturbance. It's just the same as if I were
939987 [54018] grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?"
939987 [54019] 
939987 [54020] "You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven't got one, and in
939987 [54021] that way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?"
939987 [54022] 
939987 [54023] "What, a license?" wailed Katerina Ivanovna. "I buried my husband
939987 [54024] to-day. What need of a license?"
939987 [54025] 
939987 [54026] "Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself," began the official. "Come along;
939987 [54027] I will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are
939987 [54028] ill."
939987 [54029] 
939987 [54030] "Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don't know," screamed Katerina
939987 [54031] Ivanovna. "We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?
939987 [54032] She is crying too! What's the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where
939987 [54033] are you going?" she cried suddenly in alarm. "Oh, silly children! Kolya,
939987 [54034] Lida, where are they off to?..."
939987 [54035] 
939987 [54036] Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their
939987 [54037] mother's mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off
939987 [54038] at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
939987 [54039] Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was
939987 [54040] a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for
939987 [54041] breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
939987 [54042] 
939987 [54043] "Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful
939987 [54044] children!... Polenka! catch them.... It's for your sakes I..."
939987 [54045] 
939987 [54046] She stumbled as she ran and fell down.
939987 [54047] 
939987 [54048] "She's cut herself, she's bleeding! Oh, dear!" cried Sonia, bending over
939987 [54049] her.
939987 [54050] 
939987 [54051] All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the
939987 [54052] first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the
939987 [54053] policeman who muttered, "Bother!" with a gesture of impatience, feeling
939987 [54054] that the job was going to be a troublesome one.
939987 [54055] 
939987 [54056] "Pass on! Pass on!" he said to the crowd that pressed forward.
939987 [54057] 
939987 [54058] "She's dying," someone shouted.
939987 [54059] 
939987 [54060] "She's gone out of her mind," said another.
939987 [54061] 
939987 [54062] "Lord have mercy upon us," said a woman, crossing herself. "Have they
939987 [54063] caught the little girl and the boy? They're being brought back, the
939987 [54064] elder one's got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!"
939987 [54065] 
939987 [54066] When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had
939987 [54067] not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood
939987 [54068] that stained the pavement red was from her chest.
939987 [54069] 
939987 [54070] "I've seen that before," muttered the official to Raskolnikov and
939987 [54071] Lebeziatnikov; "that's consumption; the blood flows and chokes the
939987 [54072] patient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...
939987 [54073] nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What's to be done though?
939987 [54074] She is dying."
939987 [54075] 
939987 [54076] "This way, this way, to my room!" Sonia implored. "I live here!... See,
939987 [54077] that house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste," she turned
939987 [54078] from one to the other. "Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!"
939987 [54079] 
939987 [54080] Thanks to the official's efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman
939987 [54081] even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia's
939987 [54082] room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still
939987 [54083] flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,
939987 [54084] Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were
939987 [54085] followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed
939987 [54086] to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who
939987 [54087] were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the
939987 [54088] Kapernaumovs' room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange
939987 [54089] appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his
939987 [54090] wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several
939987 [54091] open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,
939987 [54092] SvidrigaÃ¯lov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him
939987 [54093] with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having
939987 [54094] noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The
939987 [54095] official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now
939987 [54096] for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran
939987 [54097] himself.
939987 [54098] 
939987 [54099] Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased
939987 [54100] for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at
939987 [54101] Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with
939987 [54102] a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the
939987 [54103] bed, supporting her on both sides.
939987 [54104] 
939987 [54105] "Where are the children?" she said in a faint voice. "You've brought
939987 [54106] them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!"
939987 [54107] 
939987 [54108] Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,
939987 [54109] looking about her.
939987 [54110] 
939987 [54111] "So that's how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room."
939987 [54112] 
939987 [54113] She looked at her with a face of suffering.
939987 [54114] 
939987 [54115] "We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,
939987 [54116] here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I've had
939987 [54117] enough! The ball is over." (Cough!) "Lay me down, let me die in peace."
939987 [54118] 
939987 [54119] They laid her back on the pillow.
939987 [54120] 
939987 [54121] "What, the priest? I don't want him. You haven't got a rouble to spare.
939987 [54122] I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have
939987 [54123] suffered.... And if He won't forgive me, I don't care!"
939987 [54124] 
939987 [54125] She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,
939987 [54126] turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,
939987 [54127] but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and
939987 [54128] difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.
939987 [54129] 
939987 [54130] "I said to him, your excellency," she ejaculated, gasping after each
939987 [54131] word. "That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,
939987 [54132] make haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a
939987 [54133] graceful child!
939987 [54134] 
939987 [54135] "_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_
939987 [54136] 
939987 [54137] "What next? That's the thing to sing.
939987 [54138] 
939987 [54139] "_Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr?_
939987 [54140] 
939987 [54141] "What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,
939987 [54142] yes!
939987 [54143] 
939987 [54144] "In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
939987 [54145] 
939987 [54146] "Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your
939987 [54147] father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those
939987 [54148] days! Oh that's the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I've
939987 [54149] forgotten. Remind me! How was it?"
939987 [54150] 
939987 [54151] She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly
939987 [54152] hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,
939987 [54153] with a look of growing terror.
939987 [54154] 
939987 [54155] "In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in
939987 [54156] my breast!..."
939987 [54157] 
939987 [54158] "Your excellency!" she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and
939987 [54159] a flood of tears, "protect the orphans! You have been their father's
939987 [54160] guest... one may say aristocratic...." She started, regaining
939987 [54161] consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once
939987 [54162] recognised Sonia.
939987 [54163] 
939987 [54164] "Sonia, Sonia!" she articulated softly and caressingly, as though
939987 [54165] surprised to find her there. "Sonia darling, are you here, too?"
939987 [54166] 
939987 [54167] They lifted her up again.
939987 [54168] 
939987 [54169] "Enough! It's over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!"
939987 [54170] she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the
939987 [54171] pillow.
939987 [54172] 
939987 [54173] She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.
939987 [54174] Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg
939987 [54175] moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
939987 [54176] 
939987 [54177] Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless
939987 [54178] with her head pressed to the dead woman's wasted bosom. Polenka threw
939987 [54179] herself at her mother's feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though
939987 [54180] Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling
939987 [54181] that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other's
939987 [54182] little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened
939987 [54183] their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy
939987 [54184] dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
939987 [54185] 
939987 [54186] And how did "the certificate of merit" come to be on the bed beside
939987 [54187] Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.
939987 [54188] 
939987 [54189] He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.
939987 [54190] 
939987 [54191] "She is dead," he said.
939987 [54192] 
939987 [54193] "Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov,
939987 [54194] coming up to them.
939987 [54195] 
939987 [54196] Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
939987 [54197] SvidrigaÃ¯lov drew Raskolnikov further away.
939987 [54198] 
939987 [54199] "I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know
939987 [54200] it's a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I
939987 [54201] will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,
939987 [54202] and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming
939987 [54203] of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I
939987 [54204] will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn't she? So
939987 [54205] tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand."
939987 [54206] 
939987 [54207] "What is your motive for such benevolence?" asked Raskolnikov.
939987 [54208] 
939987 [54209] "Ah! you sceptical person!" laughed SvidrigaÃ¯lov. "I told you I had no
939987 [54210] need of that money. Won't you admit that it's simply done from humanity?
939987 [54211] She wasn't 'a louse,' you know" (he pointed to the corner where the
939987 [54212] dead woman lay), "was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you'll
939987 [54213] agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to
939987 [54214] die? And if I didn't help them, Polenka would go the same way."
939987 [54215] 
939987 [54216] He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his
939987 [54217] eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own
939987 [54218] phrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at
939987 [54219] SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [54220] 
939987 [54221] "How do you know?" he whispered, hardly able to breathe.
939987 [54222] 
939987 [54223] "Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich's, the other side of the wall.
939987 [54224] Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted
939987 [54225] friend of mine. I am a neighbour."
939987 [54226] 
939987 [54227] "You?"
939987 [54228] 
939987 [54229] "Yes," continued SvidrigaÃ¯lov, shaking with laughter. "I assure you
939987 [54230] on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me
939987 [54231] enormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,
939987 [54232] here we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You'll
939987 [54233] see that you can get on with me!"
939987 [54234] 
939987 [54235] 
939987 [54236] 
939987 [54237] 
939987 [54238] PART VI
939987 [54239] 
939987 [54240] 
939987 [54241] 
939987 [54242] CHAPTER I
939987 [54243] 
939987 [54244] A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had
939987 [54245] fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there
939987 [54246] was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his
939987 [54247] mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with
939987 [54248] intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been
939987 [54249] mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date
939987 [54250] of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his
939987 [54251] recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what
939987 [54252] other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained
939987 [54253] events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At
939987 [54254] times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes
939987 [54255] to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,
939987 [54256] of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous
939987 [54257] terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes
939987 [54258] seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape
939987 [54259] from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential
939987 [54260] facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome
939987 [54261] to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the
939987 [54262] neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable
939987 [54263] ruin.
939987 [54264] 
939987 [54265] He was particularly worried about SvidrigaÃ¯lov, he might be said to be
939987 [54266] permanently thinking of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. From the time of SvidrigaÃ¯lov's
939987 [54267] too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia's room at the moment of
939987 [54268] Katerina Ivanovna's death, the normal working of his mind seemed to
939987 [54269] break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,
939987 [54270] Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding
939987 [54271] himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched
939987 [54272] eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had
939987 [54273] come there, he suddenly thought of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He recognised
939987 [54274] suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an
939987 [54275] understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking
939987 [54276] outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had
939987 [54277] fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for SvidrigaÃ¯lov. Another
939987 [54278] time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes
939987 [54279] and could not at first understand how he had come there.
939987 [54280] 
939987 [54281] But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, he
939987 [54282] had two or three times met SvidrigaÃ¯lov at Sonia's lodging, where he
939987 [54283] had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no
939987 [54284] reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not
939987 [54285] to speak of it for a time.
939987 [54286] 
939987 [54287] Katerina Ivanovna's body was still lying in the coffin, SvidrigaÃ¯lov was
939987 [54288] busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At
939987 [54289] their last meeting SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
939987 [54290] an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna's
939987 [54291] children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting
939987 [54292] hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
939987 [54293] once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
939987 [54294] on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place
939987 [54295] orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something
939987 [54296] too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see
939987 [54297] Raskolnikov, mentioning that "he would like to consult with him, that
939987 [54298] there were things they must talk over...."
939987 [54299] 
939987 [54300] This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [54301] looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,
939987 [54302] dropping his voice, asked: "But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you
939987 [54303] don't seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don't seem to
939987 [54304] understand. Cheer up! We'll talk things over; I am only sorry, I've
939987 [54305] so much to do of my own business and other people's. Ah, Rodion
939987 [54306] Romanovitch," he added suddenly, "what all men need is fresh air, fresh
939987 [54307] air... more than anything!"
939987 [54308] 
939987 [54309] He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who
939987 [54310] were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By
939987 [54311] SvidrigaÃ¯lov's orders it was sung twice a day punctually. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [54312] went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed
939987 [54313] the priest into Sonia's room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,
939987 [54314] slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the
939987 [54315] thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive
939987 [54316] and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem
939987 [54317] service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and
939987 [54318] disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the
939987 [54319] coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it
939987 [54320] were, timidly weeping.
939987 [54321] 
939987 [54322] "These last two days she hasn't said a word to me, she hasn't glanced at
939987 [54323] me," Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;
939987 [54324] the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, "Give rest, oh Lord...."
939987 [54325] Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and
939987 [54326] took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,
939987 [54327] Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her
939987 [54328] head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered
939987 [54329] Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of
939987 [54330] repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the
939987 [54331] furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.
939987 [54332] 
939987 [54333] Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt
939987 [54334] very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he
939987 [54335] would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life
939987 [54336] there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had
939987 [54337] never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to
939987 [54338] the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier
939987 [54339] the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near
939987 [54340] him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he
939987 [54341] made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter
939987 [54342] restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt
939987 [54343] easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour
939987 [54344] listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively
939987 [54345] enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,
939987 [54346] as though his conscience smote him. "Here I sit listening to singing,
939987 [54347] is that what I ought to be doing?" he thought. Yet he felt at once
939987 [54348] that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something
939987 [54349] requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly
939987 [54350] understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. "No, better the
939987 [54351] struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or SvidrigaÃ¯lov.... Better some
939987 [54352] challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!" he thought. He went out of
939987 [54353] the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and
939987 [54354] his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke
939987 [54355] up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling
939987 [54356] all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he
939987 [54357] arrived. After some hours' sleep the fever left him, but he woke up
939987 [54358] late, two o'clock in the afternoon.
939987 [54359] 
939987 [54360] He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna's funeral had been fixed for that
939987 [54361] day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him
939987 [54362] some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His
939987 [54363] head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three
939987 [54364] days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.
939987 [54365] 
939987 [54366] The door opened and Razumihin came in.
939987 [54367] 
939987 [54368] "Ah, he's eating, then he's not ill," said Razumihin. He took a chair
939987 [54369] and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.
939987 [54370] 
939987 [54371] He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident
939987 [54372] annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though
939987 [54373] he had some special fixed determination.
939987 [54374] 
939987 [54375] "Listen," he began resolutely. "As far as I am concerned, you may all go
939987 [54376] to hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or
939987 [54377] tail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions. I don't
939987 [54378] want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say
939987 [54379] I shouldn't stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come
939987 [54380] to find out once for all whether it's a fact that you are mad? There is
939987 [54381] a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit
939987 [54382] I've been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,
939987 [54383] repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior
939987 [54384] to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them
939987 [54385] as you have; so you must be mad."
939987 [54386] 
939987 [54387] "When did you see them last?"
939987 [54388] 
939987 [54389] "Just now. Haven't you seen them since then? What have you been doing
939987 [54390] with yourself? Tell me, please. I've been to you three times already.
939987 [54391] Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up
939987 [54392] her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she
939987 [54393] wouldn't hear a word. 'If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can
939987 [54394] look after him like his mother?' she said. We all came here together, we
939987 [54395] couldn't let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.
939987 [54396] We came in, you weren't here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,
939987 [54397] while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: 'If he's
939987 [54398] gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it's
939987 [54399] humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for
939987 [54400] kindness.' She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.
939987 [54401] 'I see,' she said, 'that he has time for _his girl_.' She means by _your
939987 [54402] girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don't know. I
939987 [54403] went at once to Sofya Semyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was going
939987 [54404] Lost packet!
939987 [54405] Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I
939987 [54406] Lost packet!
939987 [54407] nonsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that you
939987 [54408] are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you'd not had
939987 [54409] a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but
939987 [54410] Lost packet!
939987 [54411] swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,
939987 [54412] Lost packet!
939987 [54413] worry my brains over your secrets. So I've simply come to swear at you,"
939987 [54414] Lost packet!
939987 [54415] now."
939987 [54416] Lost packet!
939987 [54417] "What do you mean to do now?"
939987 [54418] 
939987 [54419] "What business is it of yours what I mean to do?"
939987 [54420] 
939987 [54421] "You are going in for a drinking bout."
939987 [54422] 
939987 [54423] "How... how did you know?"
939987 [54424] 
939987 [54425] "Why, it's pretty plain."
939987 [54426] 
939987 [54427] Razumihin paused for a minute.
939987 [54428] 
939987 [54429] "You always have been a very rational person and you've never been mad,
939987 [54430] never," he observed suddenly with warmth. "You're right: I shall drink.
939987 [54431] Good-bye!"
939987 [54432] 
939987 [54433] And he moved to go out.
939987 [54434] 
939987 [54435] "I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it
939987 [54436] was--about you, Razumihin."
939987 [54437] 
939987 [54438] "About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?"
939987 [54439] Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.
939987 [54440] 
939987 [54441] One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.
939987 [54442] 
939987 [54443] "She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me."
939987 [54444] 
939987 [54445] "She did!"
939987 [54446] 
939987 [54447] "Yes."
939987 [54448] 
939987 [54449] "What did you say to her... I mean, about me?"
939987 [54450] 
939987 [54451] "I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn't
939987 [54452] tell her you love her, because she knows that herself."
939987 [54453] 
939987 [54454] "She knows that herself?"
939987 [54455] 
939987 [54456] "Well, it's pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,
939987 [54457] you would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your
939987 [54458] keeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love
939987 [54459] her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too
939987 [54460] may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,
939987 [54461] as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not."
939987 [54462] 
939987 [54463] "Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?
939987 [54464] Of course, if it's all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find
939987 [54465] out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense
939987 [54466] and that you've made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a
939987 [54467] capital fellow!..."
939987 [54468] 
939987 [54469] "That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was
939987 [54470] a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to
939987 [54471] time, don't worry about it. You'll know it all in time when it must be.
939987 [54472] Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh
939987 [54473] air, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant
939987 [54474] by that."
939987 [54475] 
939987 [54476] Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent
939987 [54477] conclusion.
939987 [54478] 
939987 [54479] "He's a political conspirator! He must be. And he's on the eve of some
939987 [54480] desperate step, that's certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia
939987 [54481] knows," he thought suddenly.
939987 [54482] 
939987 [54483] "So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you," he said, weighing each
939987 [54484] syllable, "and you're going to see a man who says we need more air, and
939987 [54485] so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,"
939987 [54486] he concluded to himself.
939987 [54487] 
939987 [54488] "What letter?"
939987 [54489] 
939987 [54490] "She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too
939987 [54491] much so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then
939987 [54492] she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began
939987 [54493] warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked
939987 [54494] herself in."
939987 [54495] 
939987 [54496] "She got a letter?" Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.
939987 [54497] 
939987 [54498] "Yes, and you didn't know? hm..."
939987 [54499] 
939987 [54500] They were both silent.
939987 [54501] 
939987 [54502] "Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,
939987 [54503] good-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off
939987 [54504] too. I am not going to drink. There's no need now.... That's all stuff!"
939987 [54505] 
939987 [54506] He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he
939987 [54507] suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:
939987 [54508] 
939987 [54509] "Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry's, that
939987 [54510] old woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed
939987 [54511] and given the proofs. It's one of those very workmen, the painter, only
939987 [54512] fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all
939987 [54513] that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs
939987 [54514] while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on
939987 [54515] purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the
939987 [54516] young dog! One can hardly credit it; but it's his own explanation, he
939987 [54517] has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he's simply
939987 [54518] a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of
939987 [54519] the lawyers--so there's nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course
939987 [54520] people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn't keep
939987 [54521] up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But
939987 [54522] what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!"
939987 [54523] 
939987 [54524] "Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest
939987 [54525] you so?" Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.
939987 [54526] 
939987 [54527] "What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from
939987 [54528] Porfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it."
939987 [54529] 
939987 [54530] "From Porfiry?"
939987 [54531] 
939987 [54532] "From Porfiry."
939987 [54533] 
939987 [54534] "What... what did he say?" Raskolnikov asked in dismay.
939987 [54535] 
939987 [54536] "He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his
939987 [54537] fashion."
939987 [54538] 
939987 [54539] "He explained it? Explained it himself?"
939987 [54540] 
939987 [54541] "Yes, yes; good-bye. I'll tell you all about it another time, but now
939987 [54542] I'm busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another
939987 [54543] time!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk
939987 [54544] without wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I'm going. I'll come again
939987 [54545] very soon."
939987 [54546] 
939987 [54547] He went out.
939987 [54548] 
939987 [54549] "He's a political conspirator, there's not a doubt about it," Razumihin
939987 [54550] decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. "And he's drawn his sister
939987 [54551] in; that's quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna's character.
939987 [54552] There are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of
939987 [54553] her words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this
939987 [54554] tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,
939987 [54555] what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was
939987 [54556] his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,
939987 [54557] nasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And
939987 [54558] how clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...
939987 [54559] before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....
939987 [54560] But what's the meaning now of that letter? There's something in that,
939987 [54561] too, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!"
939987 [54562] 
939987 [54563] He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,
939987 [54564] and he suddenly broke into a run.
939987 [54565] 
939987 [54566] As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,
939987 [54567] walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the
939987 [54568] smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to
939987 [54569] speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
939987 [54570] 
939987 [54571] "Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too
939987 [54572] cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon
939987 [54573] him at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry's he
939987 [54574] had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay's
939987 [54575] confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his
939987 [54576] behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he
939987 [54577] could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and
939987 [54578] fundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed
939987 [54579] in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his
939987 [54580] mind!
939987 [54581] 
939987 [54582] "And SvidrigaÃ¯lov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but
939987 [54583] somehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come
939987 [54584] with SvidrigaÃ¯lov. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, too, might be a means of escape; but
939987 [54585] Porfiry was a different matter.
939987 [54586] 
939987 [54587] "And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it
939987 [54588] _psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
939987 [54589] Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that
939987 [54590] Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay's
939987 [54591] appearance, after that tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte interview, which could have only
939987 [54592] Lost packet!
939987 [54593] passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind
939987 [54594] rest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they
939987 [54595] Lost packet!
939987 [54596] reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the
939987 [54597] first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.
939987 [54598] Lost packet!
939987 [54599] "And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the
939987 [54600] Lost packet!
939987 [54601] Lost packet!
939987 [54602] Lost packet!
939987 [54603] Lost packet!
939987 [54604] a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight
939987 [54605] Lost packet!
939987 [54606] Lost packet!
939987 [54607] Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It
939987 [54608] Lost packet!
939987 [54609] at least. "I must settle SvidrigaÃ¯lov," he thought, "and as soon as
939987 [54610] Lost packet!
939987 [54611] accord." And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his
939987 [54612] weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or
939987 [54613] Lost packet!
939987 [54614] later, if not now.
939987 [54615] Lost packet!
939987 [54616] "We shall see, we shall see," he repeated to himself.
939987 [54617] 
939987 [54618] But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry
939987 [54619] Lost packet!
939987 [54620] dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he
939987 [54621] Lost packet!
939987 [54622] him. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
939987 [54623] "Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached
939987 [54624] Lost packet!
939987 [54625] listening at the door?"
939987 [54626] 
939987 [54627] "You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry explained,
939987 [54628] laughing. "I've been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by
939987 [54629] and thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won't
939987 [54630] keep you long. Just let me have one cigarette."
939987 [54631] 
939987 [54632] "Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down." Raskolnikov gave his visitor
939987 [54633] a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have
939987 [54634] marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.
939987 [54635] 
939987 [54636] The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man
939987 [54637] will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,
939987 [54638] yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.
939987 [54639] 
939987 [54640] Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him
939987 [54641] without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a
939987 [54642] cigarette.
939987 [54643] 
939987 [54644] "Speak, speak," seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov's
939987 [54645] heart. "Come, why don't you speak?"
939987 [54646] 
939987 [54647] 
939987 [54648] 
939987 [54649] CHAPTER II
939987 [54650] 
939987 [54651] "Ah these cigarettes!" Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having
939987 [54652] lighted one. "They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I
939987 [54653] can't give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and
939987 [54654] a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to
939987 [54655] Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He
939987 [54656] positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: 'Tobacco's bad for
939987 [54657] you,' he said, 'your lungs are affected.' But how am I to give it up?
939987 [54658] What is there to take its place? I don't drink, that's the mischief,
939987 [54659] he-he-he, that I don't. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,
939987 [54660] everything is relative!"
939987 [54661] 
939987 [54662] "Why, he's playing his professional tricks again," Raskolnikov thought
939987 [54663] with disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly
939987 [54664] came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon
939987 [54665] him then.
939987 [54666] 
939987 [54667] "I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn't
939987 [54668] know?" Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. "I came into
939987 [54669] this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought
939987 [54670] I'd return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked
939987 [54671] round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.
939987 [54672] Don't you lock your door?"
939987 [54673] 
939987 [54674] Raskolnikov's face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess
939987 [54675] his state of mind.
939987 [54676] 
939987 [54677] "I've come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!
939987 [54678] I owe you an explanation and must give it to you," he continued with a
939987 [54679] slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov's knee.
939987 [54680] Lost packet!
939987 [54681] But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his
939987 [54682] face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had
939987 [54683] Lost packet!
939987 [54684] Lost packet!
939987 [54685] "A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.
939987 [54686] Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing
939987 [54687] after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;
939987 [54688] Lost packet!
939987 [54689] Lost packet!
939987 [54690] Lost packet!
939987 [54691] Lost packet!
939987 [54692] came to?... and it was quite indecorous."
939987 [54693] 
939987 [54694] "What is he up to, what does he take me for?" Raskolnikov asked himself
939987 [54695] in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.
939987 [54696] 
939987 [54697] "I've decided openness is better between us," Porfiry Petrovitch went
939987 [54698] on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to
939987 [54699] Lost packet!
939987 [54700] "Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay
939987 [54701] put a stop to it, or I don't know what we might not have come to. That
939987 [54702] Lost packet!
939987 [54703] that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you
939987 [54704] Lost packet!
939987 [54705] anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn't? What
939987 [54706] Lost packet!
939987 [54707] sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).
939987 [54708] An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,
939987 [54709] Lost packet!
939987 [54710] a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan't lose what I want,
939987 [54711] anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;
939987 [54712] Lost packet!
939987 [54713] which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did
939987 [54714] Lost packet!
939987 [54715] blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a
939987 [54716] Lost packet!
939987 [54717] realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact
939987 [54718] to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not
939987 [54719] merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get
939987 [54720] something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising
939987 [54721] Lost packet!
939987 [54722] on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that
939987 [54723] time."
939987 [54724] 
939987 [54725] "But what are you driving at now?" Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking
939987 [54726] the question without thinking.
939987 [54727] 
939987 [54728] "What is he talking about?" he wondered distractedly, "does he really
939987 [54729] take me to be innocent?"
939987 [54730] 
939987 [54731] "What am I driving at? I've come to explain myself, I consider it my
939987 [54732] duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,
939987 [54733] the whole misunderstanding arose. I've caused you a great deal of
939987 [54734] suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what
939987 [54735] Lost packet!
939987 [54736] imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!
939987 [54737] I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without
939987 [54738] Lost packet!
939987 [54739] Lost packet!
939987 [54740] all I don't want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt
939987 [54741] attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a
939987 [54742] Lost packet!
939987 [54743] Lost packet!
939987 [54744] all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart
939987 [54745] Lost packet!
939987 [54746] Lost packet!
939987 [54747] Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of
939987 [54748] Lost packet!
939987 [54749] Lost packet!
939987 [54750] 
939987 [54751] "It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail," Porfiry
939987 [54752] Lost packet!
939987 [54753] there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to
939987 [54754] Lost packet!
939987 [54755] were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have
939987 [54756] happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that
939987 [54757] Lost packet!
939987 [54758] admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was
939987 [54759] Lost packet!
939987 [54760] Lost packet!
939987 [54761] Lost packet!
939987 [54762] described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great
939987 [54763] Lost packet!
939987 [54764] dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a
939987 [54765] Lost packet!
939987 [54766] Lost packet!
939987 [54767] point of view--you can't help being partial, for after all a lawyer
939987 [54768] is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you
939987 [54769] remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the
939987 [54770] time, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,
939987 [54771] Lost packet!
939987 [54772] Lost packet!
939987 [54773] Lost packet!
939987 [54774] on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed
939987 [54775] Lost packet!
939987 [54776] dangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary
939987 [54777] Lost packet!
939987 [54778] youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your
939987 [54779] article is absurd and fantastic, but there's a transparent sincerity,
939987 [54780] Lost packet!
939987 [54781] Lost packet!
939987 [54782] Lost packet!
939987 [54783] Lost packet!
939987 [54784] Lost packet!
939987 [54785] am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is
939987 [54786] Lost packet!
939987 [54787] and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it's not at all the thing for
939987 [54788] Lost packet!
939987 [54789] Lost packet!
939987 [54790] Lost packet!
939987 [54791] has to consider him, too, for it's a matter of life and death. Why am
939987 [54792] Lost packet!
939987 [54793] Lost packet!
939987 [54794] Lost packet!
939987 [54795] Lost packet!
939987 [54796] not officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was
939987 [54797] Lost packet!
939987 [54798] thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and
939987 [54799] Lost packet!
939987 [54800] but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the
939987 [54801] subject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread
939987 [54802] Lost packet!
939987 [54803] Lost packet!
939987 [54804] Lost packet!
939987 [54805] Lost packet!
939987 [54806] Lost packet!
939987 [54807] at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over
939987 [54808] and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology
939987 [54809] Lost packet!
939987 [54810] came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!
939987 [54811] Lost packet!
939987 [54812] Lost packet!
939987 [54813] remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you
939987 [54814] so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You
939987 [54815] Lost packet!
939987 [54816] Lost packet!
939987 [54817] in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and
939987 [54818] Lost packet!
939987 [54819] your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word
939987 [54820] of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
939987 [54821] Lost packet!
939987 [54822] "So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and
939987 [54823] Lost packet!
939987 [54824] Lost packet!
939987 [54825] Lost packet!
939987 [54826] it was more natural. I was bothered! 'No, I'd better get hold of some
939987 [54827] Lost packet!
939987 [54828] breath and was all in a tremor. 'Here is my little fact,' thought I, and
939987 [54829] Lost packet!
939987 [54830] Lost packet!
939987 [54831] Lost packet!
939987 [54832] Lost packet!
939987 [54833] Lost packet!
939987 [54834] bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?
939987 [54835] 
939987 [54836] "And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on
939987 [54837] you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to
939987 [54838] Lost packet!
939987 [54839] Lost packet!
939987 [54840] thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn't believe
939987 [54841] Lost packet!
939987 [54842] and how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making
939987 [54843] very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised
939987 [54844] Lost packet!
939987 [54845] to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _MorgenfrÃ¼h_. What has Nikolay
939987 [54846] got to do with it!"
939987 [54847] Lost packet!
939987 [54848] "Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had
939987 [54849] yourself assured him of it...."
939987 [54850] 
939987 [54851] His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in
939987 [54852] indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through
939987 [54853] him, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not
939987 [54854] believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for
939987 [54855] something more definite and conclusive.
939987 [54856] 
939987 [54857] "Mr. Razumihin!" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question
939987 [54858] from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. "He-he-he! But I had to
939987 [54859] put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is
939987 [54860] Lost packet!
939987 [54861] with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return
939987 [54862] to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I
939987 [54863] Lost packet!
939987 [54864] Lost packet!
939987 [54865] at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He
939987 [54866] has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells
939987 [54867] Lost packet!
939987 [54868] He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger
939987 [54869] to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at
939987 [54870] times, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,
939987 [54871] without knowing it himself, for 'How can it be stealing, if one picks it
939987 [54872] up?' And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There
939987 [54873] have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his
939987 [54874] village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all
939987 [54875] this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what's more, he
939987 [54876] Lost packet!
939987 [54877] night, read the old books, 'the true' ones, and read himself crazy.
939987 [54878] 
939987 [54879]      [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.
939987 [54880] 
939987 [54881] "Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the
939987 [54882] wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I
939987 [54883] learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see
939987 [54884] him, and now this business came upon him.
939987 [54885] 
939987 [54886] "Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can
939987 [54887] one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The
939987 [54888] very word 'trial' frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall
939987 [54889] see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in
939987 [54890] prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,
939987 [54891] made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of
939987 [54892] the word 'suffering' among some of these people! It's not a question of
939987 [54893] Lost packet!
939987 [54894] suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time
939987 [54895] Lost packet!
939987 [54896] Lost packet!
939987 [54897] crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he
939987 [54898] seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him
939987 [54899] no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side
939987 [54900] on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to
939987 [54901] Lost packet!
939987 [54902] Lost packet!
939987 [54903] 
939987 [54904] "So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something
939987 [54905] Lost packet!
939987 [54906] Lost packet!
939987 [54907] Lost packet!
939987 [54908] Lost packet!
939987 [54909] Lost packet!
939987 [54910] he'll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to
939987 [54911] come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am
939987 [54912] studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me
939987 [54913] very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence
939987 [54914] and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,
939987 [54915] knows nothing and doesn't even suspect that he doesn't know!
939987 [54916] 
939987 [54917] "No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn't come in! This is a fantastic,
939987 [54918] gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart
939987 [54919] of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' when
939987 [54920] comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a
939987 [54921] heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,
939987 [54922] but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over
939987 [54923] a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the
939987 [54924] crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for
939987 [54925] a theory. He committed the murder and couldn't take the money, and what
939987 [54926] he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn't enough for
939987 [54927] him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and
939987 [54928] rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to
939987 [54929] recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
939987 [54930] Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is
939987 [54931] a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,
939987 [54932] poses as injured innocence. No, that's not the work of a Nikolay, my
939987 [54933] dear Rodion Romanovitch!"
939987 [54934] 
939987 [54935] All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that
939987 [54936] these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he
939987 [54937] had been stabbed.
939987 [54938] 
939987 [54939] "Then... who then... is the murderer?" he asked in a breathless voice,
939987 [54940] unable to restrain himself.
939987 [54941] 
939987 [54942] Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at
939987 [54943] the question.
939987 [54944] 
939987 [54945] "Who is the murderer?" he repeated, as though unable to believe his
939987 [54946] ears. "Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer," he added,
939987 [54947] almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.
939987 [54948] 
939987 [54949] Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down
939987 [54950] again without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.
939987 [54951] 
939987 [54952] "Your lip is twitching just as it did before," Porfiry Petrovitch
939987 [54953] observed almost sympathetically. "You've been misunderstanding me, I
939987 [54954] think, Rodion Romanovitch," he added after a brief pause, "that's why
939987 [54955] you are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal
939987 [54956] openly with you."
939987 [54957] 
939987 [54958] "It was not I murdered her," Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened
939987 [54959] child caught in the act.
939987 [54960] 
939987 [54961] "No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else," Porfiry
939987 [54962] whispered sternly, with conviction.
939987 [54963] 
939987 [54964] They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten
939987 [54965] minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers
939987 [54966] through his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly
939987 [54967] Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.
939987 [54968] 
939987 [54969] "You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method
939987 [54970] again. I wonder you don't get sick of it!"
939987 [54971] 
939987 [54972] "Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different
939987 [54973] matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You
939987 [54974] see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.
939987 [54975] Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am
939987 [54976] convinced without it."
939987 [54977] 
939987 [54978] "If so, what did you come for?" Raskolnikov asked irritably. "I ask you
939987 [54979] the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don't you take
939987 [54980] me to prison?"
939987 [54981] 
939987 [54982] "Oh, that's your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the
939987 [54983] first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest."
939987 [54984] 
939987 [54985] "How so? If you are convinced you ought...."
939987 [54986] 
939987 [54987] "Ach, what if I am convinced? That's only my dream for the time. Why
939987 [54988] should I put you in safety? You know that's it, since you ask me to do
939987 [54989] it. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him
939987 [54990] 'were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be
939987 [54991] drunk, and you were drunk, too.' Well, what could I answer, especially
939987 [54992] as your story is a more likely one than his? for there's nothing but
939987 [54993] psychology to support his evidence--that's almost unseemly with his ugly
939987 [54994] mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate
939987 [54995] drunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several
939987 [54996] times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the
939987 [54997] second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from
939987 [54998] that I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in
939987 [54999] prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you
939987 [55000] of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,
939987 [55001] that it won't be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I've come to you
939987 [55002] because..."
939987 [55003] 
939987 [55004] "Yes, yes, secondly?" Raskolnikov was listening breathless.
939987 [55005] 
939987 [55006] "Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I
939987 [55007] don't want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking
939987 [55008] for you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I've come to
939987 [55009] you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender
939987 [55010] and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my
939987 [55011] Lost packet!
939987 [55012] Lost packet!
939987 [55013] 
939987 [55014] Raskolnikov thought a minute.
939987 [55015] 
939987 [55016] "Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but
939987 [55017] psychology to go on, yet now you've gone on mathematics. Well, what if
939987 [55018] you are mistaken yourself, now?"
939987 [55019] 
939987 [55020] "No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even
939987 [55021] then, Providence sent it me."
939987 [55022] 
939987 [55023] "What little fact?"
939987 [55024] 
939987 [55025] "I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven't
939987 [55026] the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:
939987 [55027] it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.
939987 [55028] Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch."
939987 [55029] 
939987 [55030] Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.
939987 [55031] 
939987 [55032] "That's not simply ridiculous, it's positively shameless. Why, even if I
939987 [55033] were guilty, which I don't admit, what reason should I have to confess,
939987 [55034] when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?"
939987 [55035] 
939987 [55036] "Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don't put too much faith in words, perhaps
939987 [55037] prison will not be altogether a restful place. That's only theory and
939987 [55038] my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am
939987 [55039] hiding something from you? I can't lay bare everything, he-he! And how
939987 [55040] can you ask what advantage? Don't you know how it would lessen your
939987 [55041] sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken
939987 [55042] the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I
939987 [55043] Lost packet!
939987 [55044] come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these
939987 [55045] Lost packet!
939987 [55046] will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it
939987 [55047] was an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep
939987 [55048] Lost packet!
939987 [55049] 
939987 [55050] Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink
939987 [55051] dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his
939987 [55052] smile was sad and gentle.
939987 [55053] 
939987 [55054] "No!" he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances
939987 [55055] with Porfiry, "it's not worth it, I don't care about lessening the
939987 [55056] sentence!"
939987 [55057] 
939987 [55058] "That's just what I was afraid of!" Porfiry cried warmly and, as it
939987 [55059] seemed, involuntarily. "That's just what I feared, that you wouldn't
939987 [55060] care about the mitigation of sentence."
939987 [55061] 
939987 [55062] Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.
939987 [55063] 
939987 [55064] "Ah, don't disdain life!" Porfiry went on. "You have a great deal of
939987 [55065] it still before you. How can you say you don't want a mitigation of
939987 [55066] sentence? You are an impatient fellow!"
939987 [55067] 
939987 [55068] "A great deal of what lies before me?"
939987 [55069] 
939987 [55070] "Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek
939987 [55071] and ye shall find. This may be God's means for bringing you to Him. And
939987 [55072] it's not for ever, the bondage...."
939987 [55073] 
939987 [55074] "The time will be shortened," laughed Raskolnikov.
939987 [55075] 
939987 [55076] "Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you
939987 [55077] are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway
939987 [55078] _you_ shouldn't be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing."
939987 [55079] 
939987 [55080] "Ach, hang it!" Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as
939987 [55081] though he did not want to speak aloud.
939987 [55082] 
939987 [55083] He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in
939987 [55084] evident despair.
939987 [55085] 
939987 [55086] "Hang it, if you like! You've lost faith and you think that I am
939987 [55087] grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do
939987 [55088] you understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke
939987 [55089] down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something
939987 [55090] base, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!
939987 [55091] At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the
939987 [55092] furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one
939987 [55093] of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts
939987 [55094] their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and
939987 [55095] you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,
939987 [55096] is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.
939987 [55097] I know you don't believe in it--but don't be over-wise; fling yourself
939987 [55098] straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid--the flood
939987 [55099] will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What
939987 [55100] bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before
939987 [55101] you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared
939987 [55102] beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use
939987 [55103] some time. That's why I speak. It's as well that you only killed the
939987 [55104] old woman. If you'd invented another theory you might perhaps have
939987 [55105] done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,
939987 [55106] perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.
939987 [55107] But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great
939987 [55108] expiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since
939987 [55109] you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice
939987 [55110] in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don't
939987 [55111] believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it
939987 [55112] down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!"
939987 [55113] 
939987 [55114] Raskolnikov positively started.
939987 [55115] 
939987 [55116] "But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic
939987 [55117] calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?"
939987 [55118] 
939987 [55119] "Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that's all. A man
939987 [55120] perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day
939987 [55121] is over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.
939987 [55122] Though, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come
939987 [55123] to nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another
939987 [55124] class of men? It's not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of
939987 [55125] it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It's not time, but
939987 [55126] yourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The
939987 [55127] Lost packet!
939987 [55128] such a Schiller? I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get round
939987 [55129] Lost packet!
939987 [55130] Lost packet!
939987 [55131] made that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,
939987 [55132] Lost packet!
939987 [55133] Lost packet!
939987 [55134] Lost packet!
939987 [55135] Lost packet!
939987 [55136] "Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my
939987 [55137] dear fellow, and pray to God. It's more in your interest, believe me."
939987 [55138] Lost packet!
939987 [55139] "And what if I run away?" asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.
939987 [55140] Lost packet!
939987 [55141] Lost packet!
939987 [55142] Lost packet!
939987 [55143] you've only to show him the end of your little finger and he'll be ready
939987 [55144] to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you've ceased to
939987 [55145] believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what
939987 [55146] would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and
939987 [55147] what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an
939987 [55148] atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If
939987 [55149] you ran away, you'd come back to yourself. _You can't get on without
939987 [55150] us._ And if I put you in prison--say you've been there a month, or two,
939987 [55151] or three--remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps to
939987 [55152] your own surprise. You won't know an hour beforehand that you are coming
939987 [55153] with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, 'to take your
939987 [55154] Lost packet!
939987 [55155] yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never
939987 [55156] mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don't laugh at it,
939987 [55157] there's an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right. No, you won't run away,
939987 [55158] Rodion Romanovitch."
939987 [55159] 
939987 [55160] Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.
939987 [55161] 
939987 [55162] "Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don't
939987 [55163] have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air."
939987 [55164] Lost packet!
939987 [55165] He, too, took his cap.
939987 [55166] 
939987 [55167] "Porfiry Petrovitch, please don't take up the notion that I have
939987 [55168] confessed to you to-day," Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.
939987 [55169] "You're a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.
939987 [55170] But I have admitted nothing, remember that!"
939987 [55171] Lost packet!
939987 [55172] "Oh, I know that, I'll remember. Look at him, he's trembling! Don't
939987 [55173] be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you
939987 [55174] Lost packet!
939987 [55175] Lost packet!
939987 [55176] important. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don't believe
939987 [55177] Lost packet!
939987 [55178] during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to
939987 [55179] the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands
939987 [55180] on yourself--(it's an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for
939987 [55181] it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the
939987 [55182] Lost packet!
939987 [55183] sound decisions to you!"
939987 [55184] 
939987 [55185] Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The
939987 [55186] Lost packet!
939987 [55187] Lost packet!
939987 [55188] too went hurriedly out of the room.
939987 [55189] 
939987 [55190] 
939987 [55191] 
939987 [55192] CHAPTER III
939987 [55193] 
939987 [55194] He hurried to SvidrigaÃ¯lov's. What he had to hope from that man he
939987 [55195] did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once
939987 [55196] recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.
939987 [55197] 
939987 [55198] On the way, one question particularly worried him: had SvidrigaÃ¯lov been
939987 [55199] to Porfiry's?
939987 [55200] 
939987 [55201] As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He
939987 [55202] pondered again and again, went over Porfiry's visit; no, he hadn't been,
939987 [55203] of course he hadn't.
939987 [55204] 
939987 [55205] But if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he
939987 [55206] fancied he couldn't. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,
939987 [55207] he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all
939987 [55208] worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to
939987 [55209] say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague
939987 [55210] anxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety
939987 [55211] tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.
939987 [55212] Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was
939987 [55213] working better that morning than it had done of late.
939987 [55214] 
939987 [55215] And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with
939987 [55216] these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to
939987 [55217] manoeuvre that SvidrigaÃ¯lov should not go to Porfiry's? Was it worth
939987 [55218] while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone
939987 [55219] like SvidrigaÃ¯lov?
939987 [55220] 
939987 [55221] Oh, how sick he was of it all!
939987 [55222] 
939987 [55223] And yet he was hastening to SvidrigaÃ¯lov; could he be expecting
939987 [55224] something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will
939987 [55225] catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
939987 [55226] Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [55227] but some other whom he needed, and SvidrigaÃ¯lov had simply presented
939987 [55228] himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg
939987 [55229] her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as
939987 [55230] an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment
939987 [55231] especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be
939987 [55232] Lost packet!
939987 [55233] Lost packet!
939987 [55234] Lost packet!
939987 [55235] Lost packet!
939987 [55236] be of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently
939987 [55237] depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such
939987 [55238] stories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina
939987 [55239] Ivanovna's children, but who could tell with what motive and what it
939987 [55240] meant? The man always had some design, some project.
939987 [55241] 
939987 [55242] There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late
939987 [55243] about Raskolnikov's mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so
939987 [55244] painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes
939987 [55245] thought that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was dogging his footsteps. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had
939987 [55246] found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them
939987 [55247] still? Wasn't it practically certain that he had? And what if, having
939987 [55248] learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it
939987 [55249] as a weapon against Dounia?
939987 [55250] 
939987 [55251] This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never
939987 [55252] presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [55253] The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would
939987 [55254] transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to
939987 [55255] confess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps
939987 [55256] to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning
939987 [55257] Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in
939987 [55258] Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It's true Razumihin was there to protect
939987 [55259] her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty
939987 [55260] to tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.
939987 [55261] 
939987 [55262] In any case he must see SvidrigaÃ¯lov as soon as possible, he decided
939987 [55263] finally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little
939987 [55264] consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but
939987 [55265] if SvidrigaÃ¯lov were capable... if he were intriguing against
939987 [55266] Dounia--then...
939987 [55267] 
939987 [55268] Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month
939987 [55269] that he could only decide such questions in one way; "then I shall kill
939987 [55270] him," he thought in cold despair.
939987 [55271] 
939987 [55272] A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of
939987 [55273] the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he
939987 [55274] was going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from
939987 [55275] the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of
939987 [55276] the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide
939987 [55277] open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were
939987 [55278] full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and
939987 [55279] violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.
939987 [55280] He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,
939987 [55281] when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw SvidrigaÃ¯lov, sitting
939987 [55282] at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.
939987 [55283] Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [55284] was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov
939987 [55285] at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
939987 [55286] Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking
939987 [55287] absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.
939987 [55288] His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [55289] did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on
939987 [55290] the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his
939987 [55291] chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen
939987 [55292] him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the
939987 [55293] same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room. A
939987 [55294] sly smile came into SvidrigaÃ¯lov's face and grew broader and
939987 [55295] broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last
939987 [55296] SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a loud laugh.
939987 [55297] 
939987 [55298] "Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!" he shouted from the
939987 [55299] window.
939987 [55300] 
939987 [55301] Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found SvidrigaÃ¯lov in a tiny
939987 [55302] back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers
939987 [55303] of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the
939987 [55304] desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls
939987 [55305] could be heard in the distance. On the table before SvidrigaÃ¯lov stood
939987 [55306] an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found
939987 [55307] also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl
939987 [55308] of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with
939987 [55309] ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some
939987 [55310] servants' hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of
939987 [55311] the organ.
939987 [55312] 
939987 [55313] "Come, that's enough," SvidrigaÃ¯lov stopped her at Raskolnikov's
939987 [55314] entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.
939987 [55315] She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful
939987 [55316] expression in her face.
939987 [55317] 
939987 [55318] "Hey, Philip, a glass!" shouted SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [55319] 
939987 [55320] "I won't drink anything," said Raskolnikov.
939987 [55321] 
939987 [55322] "As you like, I didn't mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don't want
939987 [55323] anything more to-day, you can go." He poured her out a full glass, and
939987 [55324] laid down a yellow note.
939987 [55325] 
939987 [55326] Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,
939987 [55327] in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed SvidrigaÃ¯lov's hand, which he
939987 [55328] allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed
939987 [55329] after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.
939987 [55330] SvidrigaÃ¯lov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him
939987 [55331] was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,
939987 [55332] was by now an old friend and very obsequious.
939987 [55333] 
939987 [55334] The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was at
939987 [55335] home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was
939987 [55336] dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.
939987 [55337] 
939987 [55338] "I was going to see you and looking for you," Raskolnikov began, "but
939987 [55339] I don't know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect
939987 [55340] just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay
939987 [55341] Market. And this isn't the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.
939987 [55342] Lost packet!
939987 [55343] 
939987 [55344] "Why don't you say at once 'it's a miracle'?"
939987 [55345] 
939987 [55346] "Because it may be only chance."
939987 [55347] 
939987 [55348] "Oh, that's the way with all you folk," laughed SvidrigaÃ¯lov. "You won't
939987 [55349] admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say
939987 [55350] that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about
939987 [55351] having an opinion of their own, you can't fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I
939987 [55352] don't mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to
939987 [55353] have it. That's how it was you attracted my curiosity."
939987 [55354] 
939987 [55355] "Nothing else?"
939987 [55356] 
939987 [55357] "Well, that's enough, you know," SvidrigaÃ¯lov was obviously exhilarated,
939987 [55358] but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.
939987 [55359] 
939987 [55360] "I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having
939987 [55361] what you call an opinion of my own," observed Raskolnikov.
939987 [55362] 
939987 [55363] "Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And
939987 [55364] apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep
939987 [55365] for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there
939987 [55366] is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,
939987 [55367] told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you
939987 [55368] remember?"
939987 [55369] 
939987 [55370] "I don't remember," answered Raskolnikov with surprise.
939987 [55371] 
939987 [55372] "I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped
939987 [55373] mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet
939987 [55374] precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of
939987 [55375] it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give
939987 [55376] yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I'm
939987 [55377] convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves
939987 [55378] as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific
939987 [55379] men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable
939987 [55380] investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places
939987 [55381] where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul
939987 [55382] of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.
939987 [55383] And it's the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must
939987 [55384] be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there
939987 [55385] now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out
939987 [55386] of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it
939987 [55387] sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see
939987 [55388] nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and
939987 [55389] talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at
939987 [55390] last stand still in the middle of the road. That's not at all the thing.
939987 [55391] Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good.
939987 [55392] It's nothing really to do with me and I can't cure you, but, of course,
939987 [55393] you understand me."
939987 [55394] 
939987 [55395] "Do you know that I am being followed?" asked Raskolnikov, looking
939987 [55396] inquisitively at him.
939987 [55397] 
939987 [55398] "No, I know nothing about it," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, seeming surprised.
939987 [55399] 
939987 [55400] "Well, then, let us leave me alone," Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.
939987 [55401] 
939987 [55402] "Very good, let us leave you alone."
939987 [55403] 
939987 [55404] "You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me
939987 [55405] twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just
939987 [55406] now when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it."
939987 [55407] 
939987 [55408] "He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and
939987 [55409] pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your
939987 [55410] doorway? I saw it."
939987 [55411] 
939987 [55412] "I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself."
939987 [55413] 
939987 [55414] "And I may have had my reasons, though you don't know them."
939987 [55415] 
939987 [55416] Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the
939987 [55417] fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at SvidrigaÃ¯lov. For a
939987 [55418] full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It
939987 [55419] was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,
939987 [55420] with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow
939987 [55421] too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was
939987 [55422] something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so
939987 [55423] wonderfully young for his age. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was smartly dressed in light
939987 [55424] summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge
939987 [55425] ring with a precious stone in it.
939987 [55426] 
939987 [55427] "Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?" said Raskolnikov
939987 [55428] suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. "Even
939987 [55429] though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,
939987 [55430] I don't want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I
939987 [55431] don't prize myself as you probably think I do. I've come to tell you at
939987 [55432] once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister
939987 [55433] and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has
939987 [55434] been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.
939987 [55435] You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the
939987 [55436] second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all
939987 [55437] this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,
939987 [55438] for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late."
939987 [55439] 
939987 [55440] "Why in such haste?" asked SvidrigaÃ¯lov, looking at him curiously.
939987 [55441] 
939987 [55442] "Everyone has his plans," Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.
939987 [55443] 
939987 [55444] "You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question
939987 [55445] you refuse to answer," SvidrigaÃ¯lov observed with a smile. "You
939987 [55446] keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with
939987 [55447] suspicion. Of course it's perfectly natural in your position. But
939987 [55448] though I should like to be friends with you, I shan't trouble myself
939987 [55449] to convince you of the contrary. The game isn't worth the candle and I
939987 [55450] wasn't intending to talk to you about anything special."
939987 [55451] 
939987 [55452] "What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me."
939987 [55453] 
939987 [55454] "Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the
939987 [55455] fantastic nature of your position--that's what it was! Besides you are
939987 [55456] the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person
939987 [55457] I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I
939987 [55458] gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn't that enough?
939987 [55459] Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and
939987 [55460] is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me
939987 [55461] not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something
939987 [55462] new. Isn't that so? Isn't that so?" persisted SvidrigaÃ¯lov with a sly
939987 [55463] smile. "Well, can't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the
939987 [55464] train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my
939987 [55465] making some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!"
939987 [55466] 
939987 [55467] "What profit could you make?"
939987 [55468] 
939987 [55469] "How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all
939987 [55470] my time and it's my enjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment,
939987 [55471] but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only
939987 [55472] I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this."
939987 [55473] 
939987 [55474] He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a
939987 [55475] terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.
939987 [55476] 
939987 [55477] "Have you dined, by the way? I've had something and want nothing more.
939987 [55478] I don't drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch
939987 [55479] anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even
939987 [55480] that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind
939987 [55481] myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a
939987 [55482] peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a
939987 [55483] schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe," he
939987 [55484] pulled out his watch, "I can spend an hour with you. It's half-past
939987 [55485] four now. If only I'd been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry
939987 [55486] officer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,
939987 [55487] and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me
939987 [55488] something new."
939987 [55489] 
939987 [55490] "But what are you, and why have you come here?"
939987 [55491] 
939987 [55492] "What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the
939987 [55493] cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa
939987 [55494] Petrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!"
939987 [55495] 
939987 [55496] "You are a gambler, I believe?"
939987 [55497] 
939987 [55498] "No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler."
939987 [55499] 
939987 [55500] "You have been a card-sharper then?"
939987 [55501] 
939987 [55502] "Yes, I've been a card-sharper too."
939987 [55503] 
939987 [55504] "Didn't you get thrashed sometimes?"
939987 [55505] 
939987 [55506] "It did happen. Why?"
939987 [55507] 
939987 [55508] "Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been
939987 [55509] lively."
939987 [55510] 
939987 [55511] "I won't contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I
939987 [55512] confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women."
939987 [55513] 
939987 [55514] "As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?"
939987 [55515] 
939987 [55516] "Quite so," SvidrigaÃ¯lov smiled with engaging candour. "What of it? You
939987 [55517] seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?"
939987 [55518] 
939987 [55519] "You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?"
939987 [55520] 
939987 [55521] "Vice! Oh, that's what you are after! But I'll answer you in order,
939987 [55522] first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,
939987 [55523] what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I
939987 [55524] have a passion for them? It's an occupation, anyway."
939987 [55525] 
939987 [55526] "So you hope for nothing here but vice?"
939987 [55527] 
939987 [55528] "Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway
939987 [55529] I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something
939987 [55530] permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,
939987 [55531] something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever
939987 [55532] setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even
939987 [55533] with years. You'll agree it's an occupation of a sort."
939987 [55534] 
939987 [55535] "That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a dangerous one."
939987 [55536] 
939987 [55537] "Oh, that's what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like
939987 [55538] everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must
939987 [55539] exceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way
939987 [55540] or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate
939987 [55541] and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn't
939987 [55542] this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent
939987 [55543] man ought to put up with being bored, but yet..."
939987 [55544] 
939987 [55545] "And could you shoot yourself?"
939987 [55546] 
939987 [55547] "Oh, come!" SvidrigaÃ¯lov parried with disgust. "Please don't speak of
939987 [55548] it," he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown
939987 [55549] in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. "I admit it's
939987 [55550] an unpardonable weakness, but I can't help it. I am afraid of death and
939987 [55551] I dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent
939987 [55552] a mystic?"
939987 [55553] 
939987 [55554] "Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting
939987 [55555] you?"
939987 [55556] 
939987 [55557] "Oh, don't talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound
939987 [55558] them!" he cried with an air of irritation. "Let's rather talk of that...
939987 [55559] though... H'm! I have not much time, and can't stay long with you,
939987 [55560] it's a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you."
939987 [55561] 
939987 [55562] "What's your engagement, a woman?"
939987 [55563] 
939987 [55564] "Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that's not what I want to talk
939987 [55565] of."
939987 [55566] 
939987 [55567] "And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn't
939987 [55568] that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?"
939987 [55569] 
939987 [55570] "And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just
939987 [55571] now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.
939987 [55572] You preach to me about vice and Ã¦sthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an
939987 [55573] idealist! Of course that's all as it should be and it would be
939987 [55574] surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,
939987 [55575] what a pity I have no time, for you're a most interesting type! And,
939987 [55576] by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him."
939987 [55577] 
939987 [55578] "But what a braggart you are," Raskolnikov said with some disgust.
939987 [55579] 
939987 [55580] "Upon my word, I am not," answered SvidrigaÃ¯lov laughing. "However, I
939987 [55581] won't dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no
939987 [55582] one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when
939987 [55583] I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly
939987 [55584] interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I've drunk that
939987 [55585] half-glass of champagne and it's gone to my head a little. And besides,
939987 [55586] there's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that
939987 [55587] I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?" he asked in alarm.
939987 [55588] 
939987 [55589] Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,
939987 [55590] as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that
939987 [55591] SvidrigaÃ¯lov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.
939987 [55592] 
939987 [55593] "A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!" SvidrigaÃ¯lov begged. "Let them bring
939987 [55594] you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won't talk nonsense, about
939987 [55595] myself, I mean. I'll tell you something. If you like I'll tell you how a
939987 [55596] woman tried 'to save' me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to
939987 [55597] your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell
939987 [55598] you? It will help to spend the time."
939987 [55599] 
939987 [55600] "Tell me, but I trust that you..."
939987 [55601] 
939987 [55602] "Oh, don't be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,
939987 [55603] Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect."
939987 [55604] 
939987 [55605] 
939987 [55606] 
939987 [55607] CHAPTER IV
939987 [55608] 
939987 [55609] "You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself," began SvidrigaÃ¯lov, "that
939987 [55610] I was in the debtors' prison here, for an immense sum, and had not
939987 [55611] any expectation of being able to pay it. There's no need to go into
939987 [55612] particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a
939987 [55613] point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,
939987 [55614] and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe
939987 [55615] that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and
939987 [55616] reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which
939987 [55617] she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than
939987 [55618] I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There
939987 [55619] was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to
939987 [55620] tell her straight out that I couldn't be absolutely faithful to her.
939987 [55621] This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have
939987 [55622] liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to
939987 [55623] deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous
939987 [55624] woman, you know, that's the first consideration. After many tears an
939987 [55625] unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never
939987 [55626] leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I
939987 [55627] would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would
939987 [55628] never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa
939987 [55629] Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her
939987 [55630] secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of
939987 [55631] our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by
939987 [55632] a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On
939987 [55633] this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a
939987 [55634] sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute
939987 [55635] profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous
939987 [55636] woman are two very different things, and that's where the trouble
939987 [55637] came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain
939987 [55638] preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people
939987 [55639] about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
939987 [55640] in anyone's. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was
939987 [55641] ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very
939987 [55642] ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the
939987 [55643] innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that's enough, I
939987 [55644] think, by way of a decorous _oraison funÃ¨bre_ for the most tender wife
939987 [55645] of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue
939987 [55646] and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to
939987 [55647] attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were
939987 [55648] times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn't
939987 [55649] put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a
939987 [55650] beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that
939987 [55651] Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell
939987 [55652] in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little
939987 [55653] wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance
939987 [55654] and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya
939987 [55655] Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you
939987 [55656] believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first
939987 [55657] for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception
939987 [55658] of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don't know
939987 [55659] what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya
939987 [55660] Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of
939987 [55661] telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually
939987 [55662] complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful
939987 [55663] new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt
939987 [55664] Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were
939987 [55665] current about me.... I don't mind betting that you too have heard
939987 [55666] something of the sort already?"
939987 [55667] 
939987 [55668] "I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is
939987 [55669] that true?"
939987 [55670] 
939987 [55671] "Don't refer to those vulgar tales, I beg," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov with
939987 [55672] disgust and annoyance. "If you insist on wanting to know about all that
939987 [55673] idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now..."
939987 [55674] 
939987 [55675] "I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you
939987 [55676] treated badly."
939987 [55677] 
939987 [55678] "I beg you to drop the subject," SvidrigaÃ¯lov interrupted again with
939987 [55679] obvious impatience.
939987 [55680] 
939987 [55681] "Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
939987 [55682] you told me about it yourself." Raskolnikov felt more and more
939987 [55683] irritated.
939987 [55684] 
939987 [55685] SvidrigaÃ¯lov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught
939987 [55686] a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But SvidrigaÃ¯lov restrained
939987 [55687] himself and answered very civilly:
939987 [55688] 
939987 [55689] "Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall
939987 [55690] feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon
939987 [55691] my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with
939987 [55692] some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having
939987 [55693] repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip
939987 [55694] about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any
939987 [55695] case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna's natural
939987 [55696] aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she
939987 [55697] did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a
939987 [55698] girl's heart is moved to _pity_, it's more dangerous than anything. She
939987 [55699] is bound to want to 'save him,' to bring him to his senses, and lift
939987 [55700] him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and
939987 [55701] usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once
939987 [55702] that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.
939987 [55703] I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There's no need. As you
939987 [55704] know, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)
939987 [55705] Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn't
939987 [55706] your sister's fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as
939987 [55707] the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia
939987 [55708] Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure
939987 [55709] martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot
939987 [55710] pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or
939987 [55711] fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and
939987 [55712] would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and
939987 [55713] visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and
939987 [55714] if she can't get her torture, she'll throw herself out of a window. I've
939987 [55715] heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he's said to be a sensible fellow;
939987 [55716] his surname suggests it, indeed. He's probably a divinity student. Well,
939987 [55717] he'd better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am
939987 [55718] proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one
939987 [55719] is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn't see clearly. Hang it
939987 [55720] all, why is she so handsome? It's not my fault. In fact, it began on
939987 [55721] my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is
939987 [55722] awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you
939987 [55723] this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in
939987 [55724] spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There
939987 [55725] happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed
939987 [55726] wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another
939987 [55727] village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,
939987 [55728] wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
939987 [55729] One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in
939987 [55730] the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha
939987 [55731] alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,
939987 [55732] was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,
939987 [55733] embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,
939987 [55734] mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even
939987 [55735] tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for
939987 [55736] propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on
939987 [55737] my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally
939987 [55738] resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the
939987 [55739] female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It's the well-known
939987 [55740] resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the
939987 [55741] truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there's the hundredth part
939987 [55742] of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that
939987 [55743] leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it
939987 [55744] is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be
939987 [55745] a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the
939987 [55746] flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That's so for all
939987 [55747] stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be
939987 [55748] seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once
939987 [55749] seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her
939987 [55750] principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really
939987 [55751] had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being
939987 [55752] utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her
939987 [55753] shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of
939987 [55754] the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having
939987 [55755] snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that
939987 [55756] I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
939987 [55757] I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my
939987 [55758] treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In
939987 [55759] fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was
939987 [55760] innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and
939987 [55761] had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I
939987 [55762] explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was
939987 [55763] just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of
939987 [55764] flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property
939987 [55765] settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine
939987 [55766] now and talking too much.) I hope you won't be angry if I mention now
939987 [55767] that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.
939987 [55768] But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had
939987 [55769] several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by
939987 [55770] the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a
939987 [55771] light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and
939987 [55772] more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,
939987 [55773] but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the
939987 [55774] coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha
939987 [55775] came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a
939987 [55776] tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your
939987 [55777] sister's eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this
939987 [55778] moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.
939987 [55779] I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of
939987 [55780] her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think
939987 [55781] that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could
939987 [55782] be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,
939987 [55783] but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what
939987 [55784] a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake
939987 [55785] anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya
939987 [55786] Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that's not the word...
939987 [55787] but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by
939987 [55788] her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you
939987 [55789] are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty
939987 [55790] thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with
939987 [55791] me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,
939987 [55792] rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time
939987 [55793] that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat
939987 [55794] and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in
939987 [55795] the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I
939987 [55796] was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly
939987 [55797] attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would
939987 [55798] really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn't it?
939987 [55799] Wouldn't it? I notice that you've begun to be very attentive... you
939987 [55800] interesting young man...."
939987 [55801] 
939987 [55802] SvidrigaÃ¯lov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.
939987 [55803] Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne
939987 [55804] that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he
939987 [55805] resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious
939987 [55806] of SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [55807] 
939987 [55808] "Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have
939987 [55809] come to Petersburg with designs on my sister," he said directly to
939987 [55810] SvidrigaÃ¯lov, in order to irritate him further.
939987 [55811] 
939987 [55812] "Oh, nonsense," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, seeming to rouse himself. "Why, I
939987 [55813] told you... besides your sister can't endure me."
939987 [55814] 
939987 [55815] "Yes, I am certain that she can't, but that's not the point."
939987 [55816] 
939987 [55817] "Are you so sure that she can't?" SvidrigaÃ¯lov screwed up his eyes and
939987 [55818] smiled mockingly. "You are right, she doesn't love me, but you can
939987 [55819] never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and
939987 [55820] mistress. There's always a little corner which remains a secret to
939987 [55821] the world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that
939987 [55822] Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?"
939987 [55823] 
939987 [55824] "From some words you've dropped, I notice that you still have
939987 [55825] designs--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out
939987 [55826] promptly."
939987 [55827] 
939987 [55828] "What, have I dropped words like that?" SvidrigaÃ¯lov asked in naÃ¯ve
939987 [55829] dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his
939987 [55830] designs.
939987 [55831] 
939987 [55832] "Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What
939987 [55833] are you so afraid of now?"
939987 [55834] 
939987 [55835] "Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher
939987 [55836] ami_. But what nonsense.... I've drunk too much though, I see that. I
939987 [55837] was almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!"
939987 [55838] 
939987 [55839] He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of
939987 [55840] the window. Philip brought the water.
939987 [55841] 
939987 [55842] "That's all nonsense!" said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, wetting a towel and putting it
939987 [55843] to his head. "But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your
939987 [55844] suspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?"
939987 [55845] 
939987 [55846] "You told me so before."
939987 [55847] 
939987 [55848] "Did I? I've forgotten. But I couldn't have told you so for certain for
939987 [55849] I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really
939987 [55850] have a betrothed and it's a settled thing, and if it weren't that I have
939987 [55851] business that can't be put off, I would have taken you to see them
939987 [55852] at once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten
939987 [55853] minutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it's an
939987 [55854] interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?
939987 [55855] Going again?"
939987 [55856] 
939987 [55857] "No, I'm not going away now."
939987 [55858] 
939987 [55859] "Not at all? We shall see. I'll take you there, I'll show you my
939987 [55860] betrothed, only not now. For you'll soon have to be off. You have to go
939987 [55861] to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the
939987 [55862] woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you're thinking, that she's
939987 [55863] the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are
939987 [55864] you listening? She arranged it all for me. You're bored, she said,
939987 [55865] you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,
939987 [55866] depressed person. Do you think I'm light-hearted? No, I'm gloomy. I do
939987 [55867] no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a
939987 [55868] time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has
939987 [55869] got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and
939987 [55870] depart, and she'll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our
939987 [55871] class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down
939987 [55872] retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three
939987 [55873] years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible
939987 [55874] woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn't help;
939987 [55875] there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn't visit them. And
939987 [55876] they've two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children
939987 [55877] were not enough, and they've taken from school their youngest daughter,
939987 [55878] a girl who'll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be
939987 [55879] married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present
939987 [55880] myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,
939987 [55881] with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks
939987 [55882] of that? But it's fascinating, isn't it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You
939987 [55883] should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying
939987 [55884] to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,
939987 [55885] still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had
939987 [55886] been told, no doubt. I don't know how you feel about female faces, but
939987 [55887] to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears
939987 [55888] of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little
939987 [55889] picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb's, full little rosy
939987 [55890] lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was
939987 [55891] in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is
939987 [55892] the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on
939987 [55893] my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset
939987 [55894] and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that
939987 [55895] this is her husband and that this must be so. It's simply delicious! The
939987 [55896] present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you
939987 [55897] have what is called _la nature et la vÃ©ritÃ©_, ha-ha! I've talked to her
939987 [55898] twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that
939987 [55899] positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael's Madonna. You know,
939987 [55900] the Sistine Madonna's face has something fantastic in it, the face
939987 [55901] of mournful religious ecstasy. Haven't you noticed it? Well, she's
939987 [55902] something in that line. The day after we'd been betrothed, I bought her
939987 [55903] presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and
939987 [55904] another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all
939987 [55905] sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna's face glowed. I sat her
939987 [55906] on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she
939987 [55907] flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn't want to show it.
939987 [55908] We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first
939987 [55909] time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and
939987 [55910] vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make
939987 [55911] me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would
939987 [55912] sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is
939987 [55913] my _respect_, and that she wants 'nothing, nothing more from me, no
939987 [55914] presents.' You'll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an
939987 [55915] angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush
939987 [55916] of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is
939987 [55917] rather fascinating! Isn't it fascinating? It's worth paying for, isn't
939987 [55918] it? Well... listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!"
939987 [55919] 
939987 [55920] "The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites
939987 [55921] your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?"
939987 [55922] 
939987 [55923] "Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who
939987 [55924] knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about
939987 [55925] virtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!"
939987 [55926] 
939987 [55927] "But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...
939987 [55928] though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now."
939987 [55929] 
939987 [55930] "I am always fond of children, very fond of them," laughed SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [55931] "I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I
939987 [55932] visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You
939987 [55933] probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my
939987 [55934] old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when
939987 [55935] I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought
939987 [55936] of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great
939987 [55937] deal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young
939987 [55938] people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams
939987 [55939] and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are
939987 [55940] amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From
939987 [55941] the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be
939987 [55942] in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and
939987 [55943] there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you
939987 [55944] have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely
939987 [55945] dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one
939987 [55946] _vis-Ã -vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can't
939987 [55947] fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at
939987 [55948] last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began
939987 [55949] whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I
939987 [55950] like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,
939987 [55951] 'Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn't bring children!' Well,
939987 [55952] it's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or
939987 [55953] not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by
939987 [55954] saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and
939987 [55955] that they couldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,
939987 [55956] gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them
939987 [55957] home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were
939987 [55958] lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the
939987 [55959] country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my
939987 [55960] acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their
939987 [55961] own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my
939987 [55962] services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon
939987 [55963] by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to
939987 [55964] assist in the young girl's education in French and dancing. My offer was
939987 [55965] accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If
939987 [55966] you like, we'll go and see them, only not just now."
939987 [55967] 
939987 [55968] "Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual
939987 [55969] man!"
939987 [55970] 
939987 [55971] "Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_
939987 [55972] But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure
939987 [55973] of hearing your outcries!"
939987 [55974] 
939987 [55975] "I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself," muttered Raskolnikov
939987 [55976] angrily.
939987 [55977] 
939987 [55978] SvidrigaÃ¯lov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,
939987 [55979] and began getting up.
939987 [55980] 
939987 [55981] "I say, but I am drunk, _assez causÃ©_," he said. "It's been a pleasure."
939987 [55982] 
939987 [55983] "I should rather think it must be a pleasure!" cried Raskolnikov,
939987 [55984] getting up. "No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to
939987 [55985] describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in
939987 [55986] his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as
939987 [55987] me.... It's stimulating!"
939987 [55988] 
939987 [55989] "Well, if you come to that," SvidrigaÃ¯lov answered, scrutinising
939987 [55990] Raskolnikov with some surprise, "if you come to that, you are a thorough
939987 [55991] cynic yourself. You've plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand
939987 [55992] a great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely
939987 [55993] regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan't lose sight of
939987 [55994] you.... Only wait a bit."
939987 [55995] 
939987 [55996] SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after
939987 [55997] him. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him
939987 [55998] for a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied
939987 [55999] with something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited
939987 [56000] and uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had
939987 [56001] changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering
939987 [56002] every moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He
939987 [56003] became very suspicious of SvidrigaÃ¯lov and resolved to follow him.
939987 [56004] 
939987 [56005] They came out on to the pavement.
939987 [56006] 
939987 [56007] "You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.
939987 [56008] Only _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again."
939987 [56009] 
939987 [56010] And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.
939987 [56011] 
939987 [56012] 
939987 [56013] 
939987 [56014] CHAPTER V
939987 [56015] 
939987 [56016] Raskolnikov walked after him.
939987 [56017] 
939987 [56018] "What's this?" cried SvidrigaÃ¯lov turning round, "I thought I said..."
939987 [56019] 
939987 [56020] "It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now."
939987 [56021] 
939987 [56022] "What?"
939987 [56023] 
939987 [56024] Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their
939987 [56025] strength.
939987 [56026] 
939987 [56027] "From all your half tipsy stories," Raskolnikov observed harshly, "I am
939987 [56028] _positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but
939987 [56029] are pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister
939987 [56030] received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still
939987 [56031] all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that
939987 [56032] means nothing. I should like to make certain myself."
939987 [56033] 
939987 [56034] Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
939987 [56035] wished to make certain.
939987 [56036] 
939987 [56037] "Upon my word! I'll call the police!"
939987 [56038] 
939987 [56039] "Call away!"
939987 [56040] 
939987 [56041] Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last SvidrigaÃ¯lov's
939987 [56042] face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not
939987 [56043] frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.
939987 [56044] 
939987 [56045] "What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,
939987 [56046] though I am devoured by curiosity. It's a fantastic affair. I've put it
939987 [56047] off till another time, but you're enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let
939987 [56048] us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,
939987 [56049] to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to
939987 [56050] spend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?"
939987 [56051] 
939987 [56052] "I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to
939987 [56053] say I'm sorry not to have been at the funeral."
939987 [56054] 
939987 [56055] "That's as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken
939987 [56056] the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some
939987 [56057] orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by
939987 [56058] depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of
939987 [56059] Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her
939987 [56060] too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.
939987 [56061] It produced an indescribable effect on her. That's why Sofya Semyonovna
939987 [56062] has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is
939987 [56063] staying for the time."
939987 [56064] 
939987 [56065] "No matter, I'll come all the same."
939987 [56066] 
939987 [56067] "As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come with you; here we are
939987 [56068] at home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion
939987 [56069] just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled
939987 [56070] you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I
939987 [56071] don't mind betting it's that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!"
939987 [56072] 
939987 [56073] "And to listen at doors!"
939987 [56074] 
939987 [56075] "Ah, that's it, is it?" laughed SvidrigaÃ¯lov. "Yes, I should have been
939987 [56076] surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!
939987 [56077] Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and
939987 [56078] were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps
939987 [56079] I am quite behind the times and can't understand. For goodness' sake,
939987 [56080] explain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!"
939987 [56081] 
939987 [56082] "You couldn't have heard anything. You're making it all up!"
939987 [56083] 
939987 [56084] "But I'm not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I'm
939987 [56085] talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in
939987 [56086] you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at
939987 [56087] doors. If that's how you feel, go and inform the police that you had
939987 [56088] this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are
939987 [56089] convinced that one mustn't listen at doors, but one may murder old women
939987 [56090] at one's pleasure, you'd better be off to America and make haste. Run,
939987 [56091] young man! There may still be time. I'm speaking sincerely. Haven't you
939987 [56092] the money? I'll give you the fare."
939987 [56093] 
939987 [56094] "I'm not thinking of that at all," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.
939987 [56095] 
939987 [56096] "I understand (but don't put yourself out, don't discuss it if you don't
939987 [56097] want to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,
939987 [56098] aren't they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are
939987 [56099] nothing to you now, ha-ha! You'll say you are still a man and a citizen.
939987 [56100] If so you ought not to have got into this coil. It's no use taking up a
939987 [56101] job you are not fit for. Well, you'd better shoot yourself, or don't you
939987 [56102] want to?"
939987 [56103] 
939987 [56104] "You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you."
939987 [56105] 
939987 [56106] "What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You
939987 [56107] see, that's the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.
939987 [56108] Don't you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here
939987 [56109] is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she
939987 [56110] gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won't be till late in
939987 [56111] the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see
939987 [56112] me, didn't you? Here we are. Madame Resslich's not at home. She is a
939987 [56113] woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might
939987 [56114] have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,
939987 [56115] see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot
939987 [56116] I've got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I
939987 [56117] mustn't waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,
939987 [56118] and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I'm going to
939987 [56119] the Islands. Would you like a lift? I'll take this carriage. Ah, you
939987 [56120] refuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on
939987 [56121] to rain. Never mind, we'll put down the hood...."
939987 [56122] 
939987 [56123] SvidrigaÃ¯lov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his
939987 [56124] suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a
939987 [56125] word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only
939987 [56126] turned round on his way he might have seen SvidrigaÃ¯lov get out not a
939987 [56127] hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he
939987 [56128] had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him
939987 [56129] away from SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [56130] 
939987 [56131] "To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that
939987 [56132] coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!" he cried.
939987 [56133] 
939987 [56134] Raskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
939987 [56135] something about SvidrigaÃ¯lov which gave him a certain original, even a
939987 [56136] mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced
939987 [56137] that SvidrigaÃ¯lov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome
939987 [56138] and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.
939987 [56139] 
939987 [56140] When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as
939987 [56141] usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and
939987 [56142] began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.
939987 [56143] 
939987 [56144] He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing
939987 [56145] her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was
939987 [56146] struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call
939987 [56147] to him or not. Suddenly she saw SvidrigaÃ¯lov coming quickly from the
939987 [56148] direction of the Hay Market.
939987 [56149] 
939987 [56150] He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the
939987 [56151] bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid
939987 [56152] Raskolnikov's seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had
939987 [56153] been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not
939987 [56154] to speak to her brother, but to come to him.
939987 [56155] 
939987 [56156] That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to
939987 [56157] SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [56158] 
939987 [56159] "Let us make haste away," SvidrigaÃ¯lov whispered to her, "I don't want
939987 [56160] Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I've been
939987 [56161] sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and
939987 [56162] I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of
939987 [56163] my letter to you and suspects something. It wasn't you who told him, of
939987 [56164] course, but if not you, who then?"
939987 [56165] 
939987 [56166] "Well, we've turned the corner now," Dounia interrupted, "and my brother
939987 [56167] won't see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
939987 [56168] Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street."
939987 [56169] 
939987 [56170] "In the first place, I can't say it in the street; secondly, you must
939987 [56171] hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....
939987 [56172] Oh well, if you won't agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give
939987 [56173] any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that
939987 [56174] a very curious secret of your beloved brother's is entirely in my
939987 [56175] keeping."
939987 [56176] 
939987 [56177] Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at SvidrigaÃ¯lov with
939987 [56178] searching eyes.
939987 [56179] 
939987 [56180] "What are you afraid of?" he observed quietly. "The town is not the
939987 [56181] country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you."
939987 [56182] 
939987 [56183] "Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?"
939987 [56184] 
939987 [56185] "No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she
939987 [56186] is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother
939987 [56187] to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I
939987 [56188] don't want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken
939987 [56189] to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like
939987 [56190] this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That's the porter
939987 [56191] of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he's bowing; he sees I'm
939987 [56192] coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you
939987 [56193] will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse
939987 [56194] my putting things so coarsely. I haven't a flat to myself; Sofya
939987 [56195] Semyonovna's room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The
939987 [56196] whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?
939987 [56197] Am I really so terrible?"
939987 [56198] 
939987 [56199] SvidrigaÃ¯lov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in
939987 [56200] no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
939987 [56201] He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not
939987 [56202] notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that
939987 [56203] she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to
939987 [56204] her.
939987 [56205] 
939987 [56206] "Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the
939987 [56207] least afraid of you. Lead the way," she said with apparent composure,
939987 [56208] but her face was very pale.
939987 [56209] 
939987 [56210] SvidrigaÃ¯lov stopped at Sonia's room.
939987 [56211] 
939987 [56212] "Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How
939987 [56213] unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she's gone out, it
939987 [56214] can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....
939987 [56215] I've been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna
939987 [56216] does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if
939987 [56217] you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,
939987 [56218] my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you
939987 [56219] my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two
939987 [56220] perfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look
939987 [56221] into them with some attention."
939987 [56222] 
939987 [56223] SvidrigaÃ¯lov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was
939987 [56224] looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the
939987 [56225] furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,
939987 [56226] for instance, that SvidrigaÃ¯lov's flat was exactly between two sets of
939987 [56227] almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly
939987 [56228] from the passage, but through the landlady's two almost empty rooms.
939987 [56229] Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, SvidrigaÃ¯lov showed Dounia
939987 [56230] the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not
939987 [56231] knowing what she was called to look upon, but SvidrigaÃ¯lov hastened to
939987 [56232] explain.
939987 [56233] 
939987 [56234] "Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it's locked.
939987 [56235] By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it
939987 [56236] from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of
939987 [56237] the door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she sat there talking to Rodion
939987 [56238] Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for
939987 [56239] two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what
939987 [56240] do you think?"
939987 [56241] 
939987 [56242] "You listened?"
939987 [56243] 
939987 [56244] "Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can't sit down here."
939987 [56245] 
939987 [56246] He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her
939987 [56247] a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven
939987 [56248] feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which
939987 [56249] had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked
939987 [56250] about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently
939987 [56251] did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of
939987 [56252] SvidrigaÃ¯lov's lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask
939987 [56253] whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from
939987 [56254] asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably
939987 [56255] greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.
939987 [56256] 
939987 [56257] "Here is your letter," she said, laying it on the table. "Can it be true
939987 [56258] what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.
939987 [56259] You hint at it too clearly; you daren't deny it now. I must tell you
939987 [56260] that I'd heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don't believe a
939987 [56261] word of it. It's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story
939987 [56262] and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to
939987 [56263] prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don't believe you! I don't
939987 [56264] believe you!"
939987 [56265] 
939987 [56266] Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour
939987 [56267] rushed to her face.
939987 [56268] 
939987 [56269] "If you didn't believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?
939987 [56270] Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?"
939987 [56271] 
939987 [56272] "Don't torment me. Speak, speak!"
939987 [56273] 
939987 [56274] "There's no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought
939987 [56275] you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not
939987 [56276] with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It's spirited of
939987 [56277] you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything
939987 [56278] is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You've
939987 [56279] just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?"
939987 [56280] 
939987 [56281] "Surely that's not the only thing you are building on?"
939987 [56282] 
939987 [56283] "No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive
939987 [56284] evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I've shown you where they sat. He made
939987 [56285] a full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a
939987 [56286] pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister
939987 [56287] too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he
939987 [56288] was murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with
939987 [56289] him. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and
939987 [56290] various things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,
939987 [56291] the only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word
939987 [56292] or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don't
939987 [56293] be anxious, she won't betray him."
939987 [56294] 
939987 [56295] "It cannot be," muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.
939987 [56296] "It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....
939987 [56297] It's a lie, a lie!"
939987 [56298] 
939987 [56299] "He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It's true
939987 [56300] that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid
939987 [56301] them under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared
939987 [56302] not make use of them."
939987 [56303] 
939987 [56304] "But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?" cried Dounia,
939987 [56305] and she jumped up from the chair. "Why, you know him, and you've seen
939987 [56306] him, can he be a thief?"
939987 [56307] 
939987 [56308] She seemed to be imploring SvidrigaÃ¯lov; she had entirely forgotten her
939987 [56309] fear.
939987 [56310] 
939987 [56311] "There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,
939987 [56312] Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I've
939987 [56313] heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he
939987 [56314] thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have
939987 [56315] believed it myself if I'd been told of it as you have, but I believe my
939987 [56316] own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but
939987 [56317] she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at
939987 [56318] last."
939987 [56319] 
939987 [56320] "What... were the causes?"
939987 [56321] 
939987 [56322] "It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here's... how shall I tell
939987 [56323] you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider
939987 [56324] that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a
939987 [56325] solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It's galling too, of
939987 [56326] course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if
939987 [56327] he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his
939987 [56328] whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three
939987 [56329] thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging
939987 [56330] in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social
939987 [56331] position and his sister's and mother's position too. Above all, vanity,
939987 [56332] pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities
939987 [56333] too.... I am not blaming him, please don't think it; besides, it's not
939987 [56334] my business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a
939987 [56335] sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,
939987 [56336] that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their
939987 [56337] superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that
939987 [56338] is. It's all right as a theory, _une thÃ©orie comme une autre_. Napoleon
939987 [56339] attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a
939987 [56340] great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have
939987 [56341] overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied
939987 [56342] that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He
939987 [56343] has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he
939987 [56344] could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,
939987 [56345] and so he is not a man of genius. And that's humiliating for a young man
939987 [56346] of any pride, in our day especially...."
939987 [56347] 
939987 [56348] "But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?"
939987 [56349] 
939987 [56350] "Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was
939987 [56351] ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,
939987 [56352] Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to
939987 [56353] the fantastic, the chaotic. But it's a misfortune to be broad without
939987 [56354] a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on
939987 [56355] this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,
939987 [56356] you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking
939987 [56357] at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There
939987 [56358] are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,
939987 [56359] Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for
939987 [56360] himself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the
939987 [56361] most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost
939987 [56362] ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I
939987 [56363] never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But
939987 [56364] we've talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to
939987 [56365] interest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna."
939987 [56366] 
939987 [56367] "I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is
939987 [56368] permitted. Razumihin brought it to me."
939987 [56369] 
939987 [56370] "Mr. Razumihin? Your brother's article? In a magazine? Is there such an
939987 [56371] article? I didn't know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,
939987 [56372] Avdotya Romanovna?"
939987 [56373] 
939987 [56374] "I want to see Sofya Semyonovna," Dounia articulated faintly. "How do I
939987 [56375] go to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps
939987 [56376] she..."
939987 [56377] 
939987 [56378] Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.
939987 [56379] 
939987 [56380] "Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.
939987 [56381] She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in
939987 [56382] till quite late."
939987 [56383] 
939987 [56384] "Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the
939987 [56385] time.... I don't believe you! I don't believe you!" cried Dounia,
939987 [56386] completely losing her head.
939987 [56387] 
939987 [56388] Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to
939987 [56389] give her.
939987 [56390] 
939987 [56391] "Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.
939987 [56392] Drink a little...."
939987 [56393] 
939987 [56394] He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.
939987 [56395] 
939987 [56396] "It has acted violently," SvidrigaÃ¯lov muttered to himself, frowning.
939987 [56397] "Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will
939987 [56398] save him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get
939987 [56399] a ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of
939987 [56400] good deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great
939987 [56401] man yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?"
939987 [56402] 
939987 [56403] "Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go..."
939987 [56404] 
939987 [56405] "Where are you going?"
939987 [56406] 
939987 [56407] "To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in
939987 [56408] at that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?"
939987 [56409] 
939987 [56410] "We couldn't be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far
939987 [56411] from jeering; it's simply that I'm sick of talking like this. But how
939987 [56412] can you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive
939987 [56413] him to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already
939987 [56414] being watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving
939987 [56415] him away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He
939987 [56416] can still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.
939987 [56417] I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to
939987 [56418] consider it thoroughly. But do sit down!"
939987 [56419] 
939987 [56420] "How can you save him? Can he really be saved?"
939987 [56421] 
939987 [56422] Dounia sat down. SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down beside her.
939987 [56423] 
939987 [56424] "It all depends on you, on you, on you alone," he began with glowing
939987 [56425] eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for
939987 [56426] emotion.
939987 [56427] 
939987 [56428] Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.
939987 [56429] 
939987 [56430] "You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I'll save him. I have
939987 [56431] money and friends. I'll send him away at once. I'll get a passport,
939987 [56432] two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable
939987 [56433] people.... If you like, I'll take a passport for you... for your
939987 [56434] mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love
939987 [56435] you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let
939987 [56436] me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, 'do that,'
939987 [56437] and I'll do it. I'll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you
939987 [56438] believe, I will believe. I'll do anything--anything! Don't, don't look
939987 [56439] at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?..."
939987 [56440] 
939987 [56441] He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to
939987 [56442] his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.
939987 [56443] 
939987 [56444] "Open it! Open it!" she called, shaking the door. "Open it! Is there no
939987 [56445] one there?"
939987 [56446] 
939987 [56447] SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly
939987 [56448] broke into an angry mocking smile.
939987 [56449] 
939987 [56450] "There is no one at home," he said quietly and emphatically. "The
939987 [56451] landlady has gone out, and it's waste of time to shout like that. You
939987 [56452] are only exciting yourself uselessly."
939987 [56453] 
939987 [56454] "Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!"
939987 [56455] 
939987 [56456] "I have lost the key and cannot find it."
939987 [56457] 
939987 [56458] "This is an outrage," cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed
939987 [56459] to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a
939987 [56460] little table.
939987 [56461] 
939987 [56462] She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
939987 [56463] every movement he made.
939987 [56464] 
939987 [56465] SvidrigaÃ¯lov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
939987 [56466] He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was
939987 [56467] pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.
939987 [56468] 
939987 [56469] "You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you
939987 [56470] may be sure I've taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The
939987 [56471] Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at
939987 [56472] least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.
939987 [56473] For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing
939987 [56474] actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How
939987 [56475] should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?
939987 [56476] So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.
939987 [56477] It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna."
939987 [56478] 
939987 [56479] "Scoundrel!" whispered Dounia indignantly.
939987 [56480] 
939987 [56481] "As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general
939987 [56482] proposition. It's my personal conviction that you are perfectly
939987 [56483] right--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have
939987 [56484] no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your
939987 [56485] own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to
939987 [56486] circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think
939987 [56487] about it. Your brother's and your mother's fate are in your hands. I
939987 [56488] will be your slave... all my life... I will wait here."
939987 [56489] 
939987 [56490] SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had
939987 [56491] not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she
939987 [56492] knew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it
939987 [56493] and laid it in her hand on the table. SvidrigaÃ¯lov jumped up.
939987 [56494] 
939987 [56495] "Aha! So that's it, is it?" he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.
939987 [56496] "Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You've made things
939987 [56497] wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the
939987 [56498] revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!
939987 [56499] And how I've hunted for it! The shooting lessons I've given you in the
939987 [56500] country have not been thrown away."
939987 [56501] 
939987 [56502] "It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,
939987 [56503] wretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began
939987 [56504] to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I
939987 [56505] swear I'll kill you." She was frantic.
939987 [56506] 
939987 [56507] "But your brother? I ask from curiosity," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, still
939987 [56508] standing where he was.
939987 [56509] 
939987 [56510] "Inform, if you want to! Don't stir! Don't come nearer! I'll shoot! You
939987 [56511] poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!" She held the
939987 [56512] revolver ready.
939987 [56513] 
939987 [56514] "Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?"
939987 [56515] 
939987 [56516] "You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know
939987 [56517] you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....
939987 [56518] It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!"
939987 [56519] 
939987 [56520] "Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would
939987 [56521] have been the cause."
939987 [56522] 
939987 [56523] "You are lying! I hated you always, always...."
939987 [56524] 
939987 [56525] "Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened
939987 [56526] to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember
939987 [56527] that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?"
939987 [56528] 
939987 [56529] "That's a lie," there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, "that's a
939987 [56530] lie and a libel!"
939987 [56531] 
939987 [56532] "A lie? Well, if you like, it's a lie. I made it up. Women ought not
939987 [56533] to be reminded of such things," he smiled. "I know you will shoot, you
939987 [56534] pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!"
939987 [56535] 
939987 [56536] Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the
939987 [56537] distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was
939987 [56538] white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had
939987 [56539] never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment
939987 [56540] she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of
939987 [56541] anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The
939987 [56542] bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and
939987 [56543] laughed softly.
939987 [56544] 
939987 [56545] "The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What's this?
939987 [56546] Blood?" he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed
939987 [56547] in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just
939987 [56548] grazed the skin.
939987 [56549] 
939987 [56550] Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at SvidrigaÃ¯lov not so much in
939987 [56551] terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what
939987 [56552] she was doing and what was going on.
939987 [56553] 
939987 [56554] "Well, you missed! Fire again, I'll wait," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov softly,
939987 [56555] still smiling, but gloomily. "If you go on like that, I shall have time
939987 [56556] to seize you before you cock again."
939987 [56557] 
939987 [56558] Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.
939987 [56559] 
939987 [56560] "Let me be," she cried in despair. "I swear I'll shoot again. I... I'll
939987 [56561] kill you."
939987 [56562] 
939987 [56563] "Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don't...
939987 [56564] then." His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot
939987 [56565] again: it missed fire.
939987 [56566] 
939987 [56567] "You haven't loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge
939987 [56568] there. Get it ready, I'll wait."
939987 [56569] 
939987 [56570] He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild
939987 [56571] determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia
939987 [56572] saw that he would sooner die than let her go. "And... now, of course she
939987 [56573] would kill him, at two paces!" Suddenly she flung away the revolver.
939987 [56574] 
939987 [56575] "She's dropped it!" said SvidrigaÃ¯lov with surprise, and he drew a deep
939987 [56576] breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only
939987 [56577] the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
939987 [56578] It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,
939987 [56579] which he could not himself have defined.
939987 [56580] 
939987 [56581] He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not
939987 [56582] resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.
939987 [56583] He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to
939987 [56584] utter a sound.
939987 [56585] 
939987 [56586] "Let me go," Dounia implored. SvidrigaÃ¯lov shuddered. Her voice now was
939987 [56587] quite different.
939987 [56588] 
939987 [56589] "Then you don't love me?" he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.
939987 [56590] 
939987 [56591] "And... and you can't? Never?" he whispered in despair.
939987 [56592] 
939987 [56593] "Never!"
939987 [56594] 
939987 [56595] There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of
939987 [56596] SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly
939987 [56597] he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
939987 [56598] Another moment passed.
939987 [56599] 
939987 [56600] "Here's the key."
939987 [56601] 
939987 [56602] He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table
939987 [56603] behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.
939987 [56604] 
939987 [56605] "Take it! Make haste!"
939987 [56606] 
939987 [56607] He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to
939987 [56608] take the key.
939987 [56609] 
939987 [56610] "Make haste! Make haste!" repeated SvidrigaÃ¯lov, still without turning
939987 [56611] or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that
939987 [56612] "make haste."
939987 [56613] 
939987 [56614] Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it
939987 [56615] quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she
939987 [56616] ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.
939987 [56617] 
939987 [56618] SvidrigaÃ¯lov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he
939987 [56619] slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A
939987 [56620] strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of
939987 [56621] despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.
939987 [56622] He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.
939987 [56623] The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly
939987 [56624] caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket
939987 [56625] three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still
939987 [56626] two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He
939987 [56627] thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went
939987 [56628] out.
939987 [56629] 
939987 [56630] 
939987 [56631] 
939987 [56632] CHAPTER VI
939987 [56633] 
939987 [56634] He spent that evening till ten o'clock going from one low haunt to
939987 [56635] another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain
939987 [56636] 
939987 [56637] "villain and tyrant,"
939987 [56638] 
939987 [56639] "began kissing Katia."
939987 [56640] 
939987 [56641] SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and
939987 [56642] the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these
939987 [56643] clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the
939987 [56644] left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure
939987 [56645] garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky
939987 [56646] three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a
939987 [56647] "Vauxhall," which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was
939987 [56648] served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
939987 [56649] A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed
939987 [56650] German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The
939987 [56651] clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.
939987 [56652] SvidrigaÃ¯lov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for
939987 [56653] a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no
939987 [56654] possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was
939987 [56655] that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in
939987 [56656] selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his
939987 [56657] companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon
939987 [56658] belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem
939987 [56659] troublesome. SvidrigaÃ¯lov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of
939987 [56660] the garden. It was about six o'clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine
939987 [56661] all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than
939987 [56662] anything.
939987 [56663] 
939987 [56664] It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over
939987 [56665] the sky about ten o'clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain
939987 [56666] came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the
939987 [56667] earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each
939987 [56668] flash lasted while one could count five.
939987 [56669] 
939987 [56670] Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the
939987 [56671] bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,
939987 [56672] putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,
939987 [56673] but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the
939987 [56674] rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room
939987 [56675] without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.
939987 [56676] 
939987 [56677] She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She
939987 [56678] was giving them tea. She received SvidrigaÃ¯lov in respectful silence,
939987 [56679] looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at
939987 [56680] once in indescribable terror.
939987 [56681] 
939987 [56682] SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.
939987 [56683] She timidly prepared to listen.
939987 [56684] 
939987 [56685] "I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna," said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, "and
939987 [56686] as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some
939987 [56687] arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to
939987 [56688] you, you need not tell me." (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) "Those
939987 [56689] people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your
939987 [56690] brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them
939987 [56691] I've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had
939987 [56692] better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take
939987 [56693] them! Well now, that's settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the
939987 [56694] value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for
939987 [56695] yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one
939987 [56696] knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on
939987 [56697] living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no
939987 [56698] need for it now."
939987 [56699] 
939987 [56700] "I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my
939987 [56701] stepmother," said Sonia hurriedly, "and if I've said so little... please
939987 [56702] don't consider..."
939987 [56703] 
939987 [56704] "That's enough! that's enough!"
939987 [56705] 
939987 [56706] "But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,
939987 [56707] but I don't need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don't think me
939987 [56708] ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money...."
939987 [56709] 
939987 [56710] "It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste words
939987 [56711] over it. I haven't time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch
939987 [56712] has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia." (Sonia looked
939987 [56713] wildly at him, and started.) "Don't be uneasy, I know all about it from
939987 [56714] himself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone. It was good advice
939987 [56715] when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much
939987 [56716] better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and
939987 [56717] you will follow him. That's so, isn't it? And if so, you'll need money.
939987 [56718] You'll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same
939987 [56719] as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
939987 [56720] what's owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so
939987 [56721] heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and not
939987 [56722] yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.
939987 [56723] You can't get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned
939987 [56724] about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don't say
939987 [56725] anything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money to
939987 [56726] anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye." (He got up.) "My
939987 [56727] greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you'd better put the money
939987 [56728] for the present in Mr. Razumihin's keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of
939987 [56729] course you do. He's not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...
939987 [56730] when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully."
939987 [56731] 
939987 [56732] Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [56733] She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she
939987 [56734] did not dare and did not know how to begin.
939987 [56735] 
939987 [56736] "How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?"
939987 [56737] 
939987 [56738] "Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,
939987 [56739] Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to
939987 [56740] others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.
939987 [56741] Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigaÃ¯lov sends his greetings. Be sure
939987 [56742] to."
939987 [56743] 
939987 [56744] He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague
939987 [56745] apprehension.
939987 [56746] 
939987 [56747] It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,
939987 [56748] he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still
939987 [56749] persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where
939987 [56750] the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky
939987 [56751] Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit
939987 [56752] at first caused great perturbation; but SvidrigaÃ¯lov could be
939987 [56753] very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very
939987 [56754] intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that SvidrigaÃ¯lov had
939987 [56755] probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing
939987 [56756] vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see
939987 [56757] SvidrigaÃ¯lov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the
939987 [56758] conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct
939987 [56759] question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she
939987 [56760] were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when SvidrigaÃ¯lov
939987 [56761] would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and
939987 [56762] almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only
939987 [56763] by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other
939987 [56764] occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady
939987 [56765] Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his
939987 [56766] betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she
939987 [56767] had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.
939987 [56768] 
939987 [56769] SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important
939987 [56770] affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her
939987 [56771] fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from
939987 [56772] him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present
939987 [56773] before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his
939987 [56774] immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that
939987 [56775] purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went
939987 [56776] off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,
939987 [56777] the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the
939987 [56778] other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced
939987 [56779] by tears from the most sensible of mothers. SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up,
939987 [56780] laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon
939987 [56781] come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a
939987 [56782] sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though
939987 [56783] he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be
939987 [56784] immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He
939987 [56785] went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but
939987 [56786] the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of
939987 [56787] the most important of their doubts, concluding that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was
939987 [56788] a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great
939987 [56789] wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start
939987 [56790] off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that
939987 [56791] there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he
939987 [56792] was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,
939987 [56793] and all these people of high society didn't think of what was said of
939987 [56794] them and didn't stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that
939987 [56795] on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a
939987 [56796] word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and
939987 [56797] the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the
939987 [56798] cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said
939987 [56799] to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up
939987 [56800] whispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,
939987 [56801] amazed and rather sorrowful.
939987 [56802] 
939987 [56803] SvidrigaÃ¯lov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the
939987 [56804] way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring
939987 [56805] wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black
939987 [56806] waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.
939987 [56807] But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and
939987 [56808] went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long
939987 [56809] time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the
939987 [56810] wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side
939987 [56811] of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that
939987 [56812] there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly
939987 [56813] large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was
939987 [56814] not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place
939987 [56815] that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,
939987 [56816] blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were
939987 [56817] lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked
939987 [56818] a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,
939987 [56819] scanning SvidrigaÃ¯lov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a
939987 [56820] close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under
939987 [56821] the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow
939987 [56822] looked inquiringly.
939987 [56823] 
939987 [56824] "Is there tea?" asked SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [56825] 
939987 [56826] "Yes, sir."
939987 [56827] 
939987 [56828] "What else is there?"
939987 [56829] 
939987 [56830] "Veal, vodka, savouries."
939987 [56831] 
939987 [56832] "Bring me tea and veal."
939987 [56833] 
939987 [56834] "And you want nothing else?" he asked with apparent surprise.
939987 [56835] 
939987 [56836] "Nothing, nothing."
939987 [56837] 
939987 [56838] The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
939987 [56839] 
939987 [56840] "It must be a nice place," thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. "How was it I didn't
939987 [56841] know it? I expect I look as if I came from a cafÃ© chantant and have
939987 [56842] had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stay
939987 [56843] here?"
939987 [56844] 
939987 [56845] He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a
939987 [56846] room so low-pitched that SvidrigaÃ¯lov could only just stand up in it;
939987 [56847] it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained
939987 [56848] chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they
939987 [56849] were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty
939987 [56850] that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general
939987 [56851] colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short
939987 [56852] by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under
939987 [56853] the stairs.
939987 [56854] 
939987 [56855] SvidrigaÃ¯lov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into
939987 [56856] thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout
939987 [56857] in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from
939987 [56858] the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and
939987 [56859] almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
939987 [56860] 
939987 [56861] SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw
939987 [56862] light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The
939987 [56863] room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of
939987 [56864] them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing
939987 [56865] in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to
939987 [56866] preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached
939987 [56867] the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He
939987 [56868] declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn
939987 [56869] him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it
939987 [56870] all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the
939987 [56871] air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't. He sometimes
939987 [56872] turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not
939987 [56873] the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A
939987 [56874] candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly
939987 [56875] empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs
939987 [56876] of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov turned away
939987 [56877] indifferently and sat down on the bed.
939987 [56878] 
939987 [56879] The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking
939987 [56880] him again whether he didn't want anything more, and again receiving a
939987 [56881] negative reply, finally withdrew. SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to drink a
939987 [56882] glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began
939987 [56883] to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the
939987 [56884] blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. "It would have been better
939987 [56885] to be well for the occasion," he thought with a smile. The room was
939987 [56886] close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard
939987 [56887] a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of
939987 [56888] leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He
939987 [56889] felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. "It must be a garden
939987 [56890] under the window," he thought. "There's a sound of trees. How I dislike
939987 [56891] the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a
939987 [56892] horrid feeling." He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed
939987 [56893] Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little
939987 [56894] Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. "I never have
939987 [56895] liked water," he thought, "even in a landscape," and he suddenly smiled
939987 [56896] again at a strange idea: "Surely now all these questions of taste and
939987 [56897] comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an
939987 [56898] animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought
939987 [56899] to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,
939987 [56900] ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why
939987 [56901] haven't I put out the candle?" he blew it out. "They've gone to bed next
939987 [56902] door," he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. "Well, now, Marfa
939987 [56903] Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the very
939987 [56904] time and place for you. But now you won't come!"
939987 [56905] 
939987 [56906] He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on
939987 [56907] Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin's
939987 [56908] keeping. "I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to
939987 [56909] tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He's gone through a
939987 [56910] good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got over
939987 [56911] his nonsense. But now he's _too_ eager for life. These young men
939987 [56912] are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please
939987 [56913] himself, it's nothing to do with me."
939987 [56914] 
939987 [56915] He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's image rose before him,
939987 [56916] and a shudder ran over him. "No, I must give up all that now," he
939987 [56917] thought, rousing himself. "I must think of something else. It's queer
939987 [56918] and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly
939987 [56919] desired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad
939987 [56920] sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that's
939987 [56921] a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!
939987 [56922] But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me
939987 [56923] somehow...."
939987 [56924] 
939987 [56925] He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia's image
939987 [56926] rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,
939987 [56927] she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that
939987 [56928] he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand
939987 [56929] to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that
939987 [56930] instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his
939987 [56931] heart...
939987 [56932] 
939987 [56933] "AÃ¯e! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!"
939987 [56934] 
939987 [56935] He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly
939987 [56936] something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He
939987 [56937] started. "Ugh! hang it! I believe it's a mouse," he thought, "that's the
939987 [56938] veal I left on the table." He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the
939987 [56939] blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over
939987 [56940] his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking
939987 [56941] with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
939987 [56942] He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
939987 [56943] He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without
939987 [56944] leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and
939987 [56945] suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one
939987 [56946] instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down
939987 [56947] his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.
939987 [56948] 
939987 [56949] The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket
939987 [56950] as before. The wind was howling under the window. "How disgusting," he
939987 [56951] thought with annoyance.
939987 [56952] 
939987 [56953] He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the
939987 [56954] window. "It's better not to sleep at all," he decided. There was a cold
939987 [56955] damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the
939987 [56956] blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of
939987 [56957] anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,
939987 [56958] incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his
939987 [56959] mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or
939987 [56960] Lost packet!
939987 [56961] Lost packet!
939987 [56962] on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,
939987 [56963] Lost packet!
939987 [56964] cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with
939987 [56965] flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was
939987 [56966] surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with
939987 [56967] rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed
939987 [56968] particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant
939987 [56969] narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was
939987 [56970] Lost packet!
939987 [56971] Lost packet!
939987 [56972] the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
939987 [56973] Lost packet!
939987 [56974] were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were
939987 [56975] Lost packet!
939987 [56976] Lost packet!
939987 [56977] covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of
939987 [56978] flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a
939987 [56979] Lost packet!
939987 [56980] though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was
939987 [56981] a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of
939987 [56982] her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her
939987 [56983] pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
939987 [56984] SvidrigaÃ¯lov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle
939987 [56985] beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
939987 [56986] She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed
939987 [56987] Lost packet!
939987 [56988] soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn
939987 [56989] Lost packet!
939987 [56990] Lost packet!
939987 [56991] Lost packet!
939987 [56992] SvidrigaÃ¯lov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the
939987 [56993] Lost packet!
939987 [56994] Lost packet!
939987 [56995] his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been
939987 [56996] Lost packet!
939987 [56997] probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of
939987 [56998] rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as
939987 [56999] Lost packet!
939987 [57000] Lost packet!
939987 [57001] gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed
939987 [57002] Lost packet!
939987 [57003] Lost packet!
939987 [57004] swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and
939987 [57005] cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain
939987 [57006] and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is
939987 [57007] it now?" And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on
939987 [57008] the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
939987 [57009] 
939987 [57010] "Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go out at once
939987 [57011] straight to the park. I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,
939987 [57012] so that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on
939987 [57013] one's head."
939987 [57014] 
939987 [57015] He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his
939987 [57016] waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,
939987 [57017] into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep
939987 [57018] somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay
939987 [57019] him for the room and leave the hotel. "It's the best minute; I couldn't
939987 [57020] Lost packet!
939987 [57021] Lost packet!
939987 [57022] He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
939987 [57023] anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner
939987 [57024] Lost packet!
939987 [57025] which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little
939987 [57026] girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her
939987 [57027] Lost packet!
939987 [57028] Lost packet!
939987 [57029] black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been
939987 [57030] Lost packet!
939987 [57031] was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. "How can she have come here?
939987 [57032] Lost packet!
939987 [57033] her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby
939987 [57034] language, something about "mammy" and that "mammy would beat her," and
939987 [57035] Lost packet!
939987 [57036] Lost packet!
939987 [57037] Lost packet!
939987 [57038] of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken
939987 [57039] a cup of her mother's and was so frightened that she had run away the
939987 [57040] Lost packet!
939987 [57041] rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and
939987 [57042] spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness
939987 [57043] and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his
939987 [57044] Lost packet!
939987 [57045] her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as
939987 [57046] Lost packet!
939987 [57047] undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in
939987 [57048] the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he
939987 [57049] sank into dreary musing again.
939987 [57050] 
939987 [57051] "What folly to trouble myself," he decided suddenly with an oppressive
939987 [57052] feeling of annoyance. "What idiocy!" In vexation he took up the candle
939987 [57053] to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
939987 [57054] "Damn the child!" he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again
939987 [57055] to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.
939987 [57056] Lost packet!
939987 [57057] and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed
939987 [57058] Lost packet!
939987 [57059] of fever," thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It was like the flush from drinking, as
939987 [57060] though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were
939987 [57061] hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long
939987 [57062] Lost packet!
939987 [57063] sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little
939987 [57064] Lost packet!
939987 [57065] a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to
939987 [57066] control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,
939987 [57067] a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite
939987 [57068] Lost packet!
939987 [57069] shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they
939987 [57070] turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited
939987 [57071] him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that
939987 [57072] laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. "What,
939987 [57073] Lost packet!
939987 [57074] it mean?" And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding
939987 [57075] out her arms.... "Accursed child!" SvidrigaÃ¯lov cried, raising his hand
939987 [57076] to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.
939987 [57077] 
939987 [57078] He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not
939987 [57079] been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.
939987 [57080] 
939987 [57081] "I've had nightmare all night!" He got up angrily, feeling utterly
939987 [57082] shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could
939987 [57083] see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,
939987 [57084] put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his
939987 [57085] Lost packet!
939987 [57086] pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few
939987 [57087] Lost packet!
939987 [57088] elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some
939987 [57089] Lost packet!
939987 [57090] the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began
939987 [57091] trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.
939987 [57092] At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he
939987 [57093] Lost packet!
939987 [57094] Lost packet!
939987 [57095] 
939987 [57096] A thick milky mist hung over the town. SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked along the
939987 [57097] slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing
939987 [57098] the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,
939987 [57099] Lost packet!
939987 [57100] Lost packet!
939987 [57101] Lost packet!
939987 [57102] The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with
939987 [57103] their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and
939987 [57104] Lost packet!
939987 [57105] Lost packet!
939987 [57106] came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with
939987 [57107] its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead
939987 [57108] Lost packet!
939987 [57109] stood up on the left. "Bah!" he shouted, "here is a place. Why should
939987 [57110] Lost packet!
939987 [57111] Lost packet!
939987 [57112] 
939987 [57113] He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where
939987 [57114] there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of
939987 [57115] the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,
939987 [57116] wrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his
939987 [57117] Lost packet!
939987 [57118] Lost packet!
939987 [57119] printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,
939987 [57120] SvidrigaÃ¯lov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes
939987 [57121] without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man
939987 [57122] not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a
939987 [57123] word.
939987 [57124] 
939987 [57125] "What do you want here?" he said, without moving or changing his
939987 [57126] position.
939987 [57127] 
939987 [57128] "Nothing, brother, good morning," answered SvidrigaÃ¯lov.
939987 [57129] 
939987 [57130] "This isn't the place."
939987 [57131] 
939987 [57132] "I am going to foreign parts, brother."
939987 [57133] 
939987 [57134] "To foreign parts?"
939987 [57135] 
939987 [57136] "To America."
939987 [57137] 
939987 [57138] "America."
939987 [57139] 
939987 [57140] SvidrigaÃ¯lov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his
939987 [57141] eyebrows.
939987 [57142] 
939987 [57143] "I say, this is not the place for such jokes!"
939987 [57144] 
939987 [57145] "Why shouldn't it be the place?"
939987 [57146] 
939987 [57147] "Because it isn't."
939987 [57148] 
939987 [57149] "Well, brother, I don't mind that. It's a good place. When you are
939987 [57150] asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America."
939987 [57151] 
939987 [57152] He put the revolver to his right temple.
939987 [57153] 
939987 [57154] "You can't do it here, it's not the place," cried Achilles, rousing
939987 [57155] himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
939987 [57156] 
939987 [57157] SvidrigaÃ¯lov pulled the trigger.
939987 [57158] 
939987 [57159] 
939987 [57160] 
939987 [57161] CHAPTER VII
939987 [57162] 
939987 [57163] The same day, about seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on
939987 [57164] his way to his mother's and sister's lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev's
939987 [57165] house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from
939987 [57166] the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still
939987 [57167] hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:
939987 [57168] his decision was taken.
939987 [57169] 
939987 [57170] "Besides, it doesn't matter, they still know nothing," he thought, "and
939987 [57171] they are used to thinking of me as eccentric."
939987 [57172] 
939987 [57173] He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a
939987 [57174] night's rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the
939987 [57175] inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all
939987 [57176] the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a
939987 [57177] decision.
939987 [57178] 
939987 [57179] He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not
939987 [57180] at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria
939987 [57181] Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by
939987 [57182] the hand and drew him into the room.
939987 [57183] 
939987 [57184] "Here you are!" she began, faltering with joy. "Don't be angry with
939987 [57185] me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not
939987 [57186] crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I've got
939987 [57187] into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I've been like that ever
939987 [57188] since your father's death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you
939987 [57189] must be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are."
939987 [57190] 
939987 [57191] "I was in the rain yesterday, mother...." Raskolnikov began.
939987 [57192] 
939987 [57193] "No, no," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, "you thought I
939987 [57194] was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don't be
939987 [57195] anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I've learned the ways
939987 [57196] here and truly I see for myself that they are better. I've made up my
939987 [57197] mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to
939987 [57198] give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,
939987 [57199] or what ideas you are hatching; so it's not for me to keep nudging your
939987 [57200] Lost packet!
939987 [57201] Lost packet!
939987 [57202] article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch
939987 [57203] brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: 'There,
939987 [57204] foolish one,' I thought, 'that's what he is busy about; that's the
939987 [57205] Lost packet!
939987 [57206] have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I
939987 [57207] worry him and upset him.' I read it, my dear, and of course there was a
939987 [57208] great deal I did not understand; but that's only natural--how should I?"
939987 [57209] Lost packet!
939987 [57210] "Show me, mother."
939987 [57211] 
939987 [57212] Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous
939987 [57213] as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and
939987 [57214] bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he
939987 [57215] sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only
939987 [57216] a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed
939987 [57217] with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding
939987 [57218] months. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.
939987 [57219] 
939987 [57220] "But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you
939987 [57221] will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the
939987 [57222] Lost packet!
939987 [57223] don't know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,
939987 [57224] Lost packet!
939987 [57225] Lost packet!
939987 [57226] Lost packet!
939987 [57227] Lost packet!
939987 [57228] out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren't! I was
939987 [57229] breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your
939987 [57230] Lost packet!
939987 [57231] Lost packet!
939987 [57232] Lost packet!
939987 [57233] occupied with much more important matters...."
939987 [57234] Lost packet!
939987 [57235] Lost packet!
939987 [57236] 
939987 [57237] "No, Rodya. I often don't see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri
939987 [57238] Prokofitch comes to see me, it's so good of him, and he always talks
939987 [57239] about you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don't say that
939987 [57240] Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has
939987 [57241] her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and
939987 [57242] I never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia
939987 [57243] has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don't
939987 [57244] know what it will all lead to. You've made me so happy by coming now,
939987 [57245] Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I'll tell
939987 [57246] her: 'Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all
939987 [57247] this time?' You mustn't spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,
939987 [57248] but if you can't, it doesn't matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,
939987 [57249] that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what
939987 [57250] you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you'll
939987 [57251] come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you've come now to
939987 [57252] comfort your mother, I see that."
939987 [57253] 
939987 [57254] Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
939987 [57255] 
939987 [57256] "Here I am again! Don't mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I
939987 [57257] sitting here?" she cried, jumping up. "There is coffee and I don't offer
939987 [57258] you any. Ah, that's the selfishness of old age. I'll get it at once!"
939987 [57259] 
939987 [57260] "Mother, don't trouble, I am going at once. I haven't come for that.
939987 [57261] Please listen to me."
939987 [57262] 
939987 [57263] Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
939987 [57264] 
939987 [57265] "Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are
939987 [57266] told about me, will you always love me as you do now?" he asked suddenly
939987 [57267] from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and
939987 [57268] not weighing them.
939987 [57269] 
939987 [57270] "Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?
939987 [57271] Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn't believe
939987 [57272] anyone, I should refuse to listen."
939987 [57273] 
939987 [57274] "I've come to assure you that I've always loved you and I am glad
939987 [57275] that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out," he went on with the same
939987 [57276] impulse. "I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you
939987 [57277] must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all
939987 [57278] you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn't care about you, was
939987 [57279] all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that's enough:
939987 [57280] I thought I must do this and begin with this...."
939987 [57281] 
939987 [57282] Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her
939987 [57283] bosom and weeping gently.
939987 [57284] 
939987 [57285] "I don't know what is wrong with you, Rodya," she said at last. "I've
939987 [57286] been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see
939987 [57287] that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that's why you are
939987 [57288] miserable. I've foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking
939987 [57289] about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister
939987 [57290] lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I
939987 [57291] caught something, but I couldn't make it out. I felt all the morning
939987 [57292] as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting
939987 [57293] something, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You
939987 [57294] are going away somewhere?"
939987 [57295] 
939987 [57296] "Yes."
939987 [57297] 
939987 [57298] "That's what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need
939987 [57299] me. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya
939987 [57300] Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon
939987 [57301] her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.
939987 [57302] But... where... are you going?"
939987 [57303] 
939987 [57304] "Good-bye, mother."
939987 [57305] 
939987 [57306] "What, to-day?" she cried, as though losing him for ever.
939987 [57307] 
939987 [57308] "I can't stay, I must go now...."
939987 [57309] 
939987 [57310] "And can't I come with you?"
939987 [57311] 
939987 [57312] "No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will
939987 [57313] reach Him."
939987 [57314] 
939987 [57315] "Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That's right, that's
939987 [57316] right. Oh, God, what are we doing?"
939987 [57317] 
939987 [57318] Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that
939987 [57319] he was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful
939987 [57320] months his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her
939987 [57321] feet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not
939987 [57322] question him this time. For some days she had realised that something
939987 [57323] awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had
939987 [57324] come for him.
939987 [57325] 
939987 [57326] "Rodya, my darling, my first born," she said sobbing, "now you are just
939987 [57327] as when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and
939987 [57328] kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us
939987 [57329] simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we
939987 [57330] wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I've been crying
939987 [57331] lately, it's that my mother's heart had a foreboding of trouble. The
939987 [57332] first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived
939987 [57333] here, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day
939987 [57334] when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had
939987 [57335] come. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?"
939987 [57336] 
939987 [57337] "No!"
939987 [57338] 
939987 [57339] "You'll come again?"
939987 [57340] 
939987 [57341] "Yes... I'll come."
939987 [57342] 
939987 [57343] "Rodya, don't be angry, I don't dare to question you. I know I mustn't.
939987 [57344] Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?"
939987 [57345] 
939987 [57346] "Very far."
939987 [57347] 
939987 [57348] "What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?"
939987 [57349] 
939987 [57350] "What God sends... only pray for me." Raskolnikov went to the door, but
939987 [57351] she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked
939987 [57352] with terror.
939987 [57353] 
939987 [57354] "Enough, mother," said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.
939987 [57355] 
939987 [57356] "Not for ever, it's not yet for ever? You'll come, you'll come
939987 [57357] to-morrow?"
939987 [57358] 
939987 [57359] "I will, I will, good-bye." He tore himself away at last.
939987 [57360] 
939987 [57361] It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
939987 [57362] Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all
939987 [57363] before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the
939987 [57364] stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him
939987 [57365] intently. "Can anyone have come to see me?" he wondered. He had a
939987 [57366] disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She
939987 [57367] was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had
939987 [57368] been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from
939987 [57369] the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,
939987 [57370] betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at
939987 [57371] once that she knew.
939987 [57372] 
939987 [57373] "Am I to come in or go away?" he asked uncertainly.
939987 [57374] 
939987 [57375] "I've been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.
939987 [57376] We thought that you would be sure to come there."
939987 [57377] 
939987 [57378] Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.
939987 [57379] 
939987 [57380] "I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this
939987 [57381] moment to be able to control myself."
939987 [57382] 
939987 [57383] He glanced at her mistrustfully.
939987 [57384] 
939987 [57385] "Where were you all night?"
939987 [57386] 
939987 [57387] "I don't remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind
939987 [57388] once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that
939987 [57389] I wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn't make up my mind," he
939987 [57390] whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.
939987 [57391] 
939987 [57392] "Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and
939987 [57393] I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!"
939987 [57394] 
939987 [57395] Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
939987 [57396] 
939987 [57397] "I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in mother's arms; I
939987 [57398] haven't faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don't know
939987 [57399] how it is, Dounia, I don't understand it."
939987 [57400] 
939987 [57401] "Have you been at mother's? Have you told her?" cried Dounia,
939987 [57402] horror-stricken. "Surely you haven't done that?"
939987 [57403] 
939987 [57404] "No, I didn't tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.
939987 [57405] She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it
939987 [57406] already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don't know why I did
939987 [57407] go. I am a contemptible person, Dounia."
939987 [57408] 
939987 [57409] "A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren't
939987 [57410] you?"
939987 [57411] 
939987 [57412] "Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of
939987 [57413] drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that
939987 [57414] if I had considered myself strong till now I'd better not be afraid of
939987 [57415] disgrace," he said, hurrying on. "It's pride, Dounia."
939987 [57416] 
939987 [57417] "Pride, Rodya."
939987 [57418] 
939987 [57419] There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad
939987 [57420] to think that he was still proud.
939987 [57421] 
939987 [57422] "You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?" he
939987 [57423] asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.
939987 [57424] 
939987 [57425] "Oh, Rodya, hush!" cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two
939987 [57426] minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the
939987 [57427] other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got
939987 [57428] up.
939987 [57429] 
939987 [57430] "It's late, it's time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I
939987 [57431] don't know why I am going to give myself up."
939987 [57432] 
939987 [57433] Big tears fell down her cheeks.
939987 [57434] 
939987 [57435] "You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?"
939987 [57436] 
939987 [57437] "You doubted it?"
939987 [57438] 
939987 [57439] She threw her arms round him.
939987 [57440] 
939987 [57441] "Aren't you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?" she
939987 [57442] cried, holding him close and kissing him.
939987 [57443] 
939987 [57444] "Crime? What crime?" he cried in sudden fury. "That I killed a vile
939987 [57445] noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing
939987 [57446] her was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor
939987 [57447] people. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking
939987 [57448] of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? 'A
939987 [57449] crime! a crime!' Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,
939987 [57450] now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It's simply
939987 [57451] because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,
939987 [57452] perhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!"
939987 [57453] 
939987 [57454] "Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?" cried
939987 [57455] Dounia in despair.
939987 [57456] 
939987 [57457] "Which all men shed," he put in almost frantically, "which flows and has
939987 [57458] always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which
939987 [57459] men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of
939987 [57460] mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to
939987 [57461] do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds
939987 [57462] to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply
939987 [57463] clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now
939987 [57464] that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that
939987 [57465] stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to
939987 [57466] take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have
939987 [57467] been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...
939987 [57468] I couldn't carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,
939987 [57469] that's what's the matter! And yet I won't look at it as you do. If I had
939987 [57470] succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I'm trapped."
939987 [57471] 
939987 [57472] "But that's not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?"
939987 [57473] 
939987 [57474] "Ah, it's not picturesque, not Ã¦sthetically attractive! I fail to
939987 [57475] understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.
939987 [57476] The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I've never,
939987 [57477] never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever
939987 [57478] from seeing that what I did was a crime. I've never, never been stronger
939987 [57479] and more convinced than now."
939987 [57480] 
939987 [57481] The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered
939987 [57482] his last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia's eyes and he saw such
939987 [57483] anguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he
939987 [57484] had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,
939987 [57485] the cause...
939987 [57486] 
939987 [57487] "Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven
939987 [57488] if I am guilty). Good-bye! We won't dispute. It's time, high time to go.
939987 [57489] Don't follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you
939987 [57490] go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It's my last request
939987 [57491] of you. Don't leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that
939987 [57492] she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with
939987 [57493] her! Razumihin will be with you. I've been talking to him.... Don't cry
939987 [57494] about me: I'll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a
939987 [57495] murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won't disgrace you,
939987 [57496] you will see; I'll still show.... Now good-bye for the present," he
939987 [57497] concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia's
939987 [57498] eyes at his last words and promises. "Why are you crying? Don't cry,
939987 [57499] don't cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I'd
939987 [57500] forgotten!"
939987 [57501] 
939987 [57502] He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took
939987 [57503] from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was
939987 [57504] the portrait of his landlady's daughter, who had died of fever, that
939987 [57505] strange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the
939987 [57506] delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave
939987 [57507] it to Dounia.
939987 [57508] 
939987 [57509] "I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her," he said
939987 [57510] thoughtfully. "To her heart I confided much of what has since been so
939987 [57511] hideously realised. Don't be uneasy," he returned to Dounia, "she was
939987 [57512] as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great
939987 [57513] point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to
939987 [57514] be broken in two," he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.
939987 [57515] "Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?
939987 [57516] They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What's the object of these
939987 [57517] senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I
939987 [57518] am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty
939987 [57519] years' penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I
939987 [57520] consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood
939987 [57521] looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!"
939987 [57522] 
939987 [57523] At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.
939987 [57524] She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look
939987 [57525] at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for
939987 [57526] the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,
939987 [57527] he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the
939987 [57528] corner abruptly.
939987 [57529] 
939987 [57530] "I am wicked, I see that," he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a
939987 [57531] moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. "But why are they so fond
939987 [57532] of me if I don't deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved
939987 [57533] me and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have
939987 [57534] happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so
939987 [57535] meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word
939987 [57536] that I am a criminal? Yes, that's it, that's it, that's what they are
939987 [57537] sending me there for, that's what they want. Look at them running to and
939987 [57538] fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at
939987 [57539] heart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they'd be
939987 [57540] wild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!"
939987 [57541] 
939987 [57542] He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could
939987 [57543] be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
939987 [57544] And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual
939987 [57545] bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should
939987 [57546] he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be
939987 [57547] so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that
939987 [57548] question since the previous evening, but still he went.
939987 [57549] 
939987 [57550] 
939987 [57551] 
939987 [57552] CHAPTER VIII
939987 [57553] 
939987 [57554] When he went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark. All day
939987 [57555] Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been
939987 [57556] waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering
939987 [57557] SvidrigaÃ¯lov's words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the
939987 [57558] conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.
939987 [57559] Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her
939987 [57560] brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his
939987 [57561] confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;
939987 [57562] she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,
939987 [57563] but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and
939987 [57564] at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point
939987 [57565] of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at
939987 [57566] Dounia. Dounia's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively
939987 [57567] and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room had
939987 [57568] remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.
939987 [57569] 
939987 [57570] Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her
939987 [57571] brother's room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come
939987 [57572] there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread
939987 [57573] of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent
939987 [57574] the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both
939987 [57575] were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each
939987 [57576] thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how SvidrigaÃ¯lov had said to
939987 [57577] her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...
939987 [57578] Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
939987 [57579] 
939987 [57580] "Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to
939987 [57581] make him live?" she thought at last in despair.
939987 [57582] 
939987 [57583] Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
939987 [57584] intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
939987 [57585] unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to
939987 [57586] feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.
939987 [57587] 
939987 [57588] She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned
939987 [57589] pale.
939987 [57590] 
939987 [57591] "Yes," said Raskolnikov, smiling. "I have come for your cross, Sonia. It
939987 [57592] was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
939987 [57593] now it's come to that?"
939987 [57594] 
939987 [57595] Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
939987 [57596] shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
939987 [57597] words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid
939987 [57598] meeting her eyes.
939987 [57599] 
939987 [57600] "You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. There is one
939987 [57601] fact.... But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it. But
939987 [57602] do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish
939987 [57603] faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid
939987 [57604] questions, which I shall have to answer--they'll point their fingers at
939987 [57605] me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I'd
939987 [57606] rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
939987 [57607] him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I've become
939987 [57608] too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my
939987 [57609] sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It's
939987 [57610] a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the
939987 [57611] crosses?"
939987 [57612] 
939987 [57613] He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or
939987 [57614] concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after
939987 [57615] one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.
939987 [57616] 
939987 [57617] Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress
939987 [57618] wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and
939987 [57619] over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.
939987 [57620] 
939987 [57621] "It's the symbol of my taking up the cross," he laughed. "As though I
939987 [57622] had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant
939987 [57623] one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's--you will wear yourself, show
939987 [57624] me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like
939987 [57625] these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old
939987 [57626] woman's neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I
939987 [57627] ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what
939987 [57628] matters; I'm somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,
939987 [57629] Sonia, so that you might know... that's all--that's all I came for. But
939987 [57630] I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I
939987 [57631] am going to prison and you'll have your wish. Well, what are you crying
939987 [57632] for? You too? Don't. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!"
939987 [57633] 
939987 [57634] But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. "Why
939987 [57635] is she grieving too?" he thought to himself. "What am I to her? Why does
939987 [57636] she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She'll
939987 [57637] be my nurse."
939987 [57638] 
939987 [57639] "Cross yourself, say at least one prayer," Sonia begged in a timid
939987 [57640] broken voice.
939987 [57641] 
939987 [57642] "Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely...."
939987 [57643] 
939987 [57644] But he wanted to say something quite different.
939987 [57645] 
939987 [57646] He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put
939987 [57647] it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which
939987 [57648] Marmeladov had spoken, "the family shawl." Raskolnikov thought of that
939987 [57649] looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he
939987 [57650] was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was
939987 [57651] frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia
939987 [57652] meant to go with him.
939987 [57653] 
939987 [57654] "What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I'll go
939987 [57655] alone," he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved
939987 [57656] towards the door. "What's the use of going in procession?" he muttered
939987 [57657] going out.
939987 [57658] 
939987 [57659] Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said
939987 [57660] good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt
939987 [57661] surged in his heart.
939987 [57662] 
939987 [57663] "Was it right, was it right, all this?" he thought again as he went down
939987 [57664] the stairs. "Couldn't he stop and retract it all... and not go?"
939987 [57665] 
939987 [57666] But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn't ask
939987 [57667] himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he
939987 [57668] had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of
939987 [57669] the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted
939987 [57670] at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another
939987 [57671] thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike
939987 [57672] him then.
939987 [57673] 
939987 [57674] "Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on
939987 [57675] business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was
939987 [57676] _going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away
939987 [57677] just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I've sunk! No,
939987 [57678] I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart
939987 [57679] ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some
939987 [57680] friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what
939987 [57681] I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!"
939987 [57682] 
939987 [57683] He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But
939987 [57684] on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it
939987 [57685] went to the Hay Market.
939987 [57686] 
939987 [57687] He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and
939987 [57688] could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. "In
939987 [57689] another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this
939987 [57690] bridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember
939987 [57691] this!" slipped into his mind. "Look at this sign! How shall I read those
939987 [57692] letters then? It's written here 'Campany,' that's a thing to remember,
939987 [57693] that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look
939987 [57694] at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial
939987 [57695] it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be
939987 [57696] interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am
939987 [57697] becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how
939987 [57698] people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against
939987 [57699] me, does he know whom he pushed? There's a peasant woman with a baby,
939987 [57700] begging. It's curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might
939987 [57701] give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here's a five copeck
939987 [57702] piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my
939987 [57703] good woman!"
939987 [57704] 
939987 [57705] "God bless you," the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.
939987 [57706] 
939987 [57707] He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be
939987 [57708] in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have
939987 [57709] given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he
939987 [57710] would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and
939987 [57711] disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There
939987 [57712] was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,
939987 [57713] stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short
939987 [57714] jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,
939987 [57715] though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he
939987 [57716] was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly
939987 [57717] came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
939987 [57718] 
939987 [57719] He suddenly recalled Sonia's words, "Go to the cross-roads, bow down to
939987 [57720] the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say
939987 [57721] aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.'" He trembled, remembering
939987 [57722] that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially
939987 [57723] of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively
939987 [57724] clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came
939987 [57725] over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and
939987 [57726] spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the
939987 [57727] tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....
939987 [57728] 
939987 [57729] He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and
939987 [57730] kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed
939987 [57731] down a second time.
939987 [57732] 
939987 [57733] "He's boozed," a youth near him observed.
939987 [57734] 
939987 [57735] There was a roar of laughter.
939987 [57736] 
939987 [57737] "He's going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children
939987 [57738] and his country. He's bowing down to all the world and kissing the great
939987 [57739] city of St. Petersburg and its pavement," added a workman who was a
939987 [57740] little drunk.
939987 [57741] 
939987 [57742] "Quite a young man, too!" observed a third.
939987 [57743] 
939987 [57744] "And a gentleman," someone observed soberly.
939987 [57745] 
939987 [57746] "There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays."
939987 [57747] 
939987 [57748] These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, "I am
939987 [57749] a murderer," which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,
939987 [57750] died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking
939987 [57751] round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a
939987 [57752] glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt
939987 [57753] that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he
939987 [57754] saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding
939987 [57755] from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had
939987 [57756] followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt
939987 [57757] and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow
939987 [57758] him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his
939987 [57759] heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.
939987 [57760] 
939987 [57761] He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third
939987 [57762] storey. "I shall be some time going up," he thought. He felt as though
939987 [57763] the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time
939987 [57764] left for consideration.
939987 [57765] 
939987 [57766] Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
939987 [57767] stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and
939987 [57768] the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been
939987 [57769] here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but
939987 [57770] still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to
939987 [57771] collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. "But why? what for?" he
939987 [57772] wondered, reflecting. "If I must drink the cup what difference does it
939987 [57773] make? The more revolting the better." He imagined for an instant the
939987 [57774] figure of the "explosive lieutenant," Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually
939987 [57775] going to him? Couldn't he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?
939987 [57776] Couldn't he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings?
939987 [57777] At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the "explosive
939987 [57778] lieutenant"! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.
939987 [57779] 
939987 [57780] Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.
939987 [57781] There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a
939987 [57782] peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
939987 [57783] Raskolnikov walked into the next room. "Perhaps I still need not speak,"
939987 [57784] passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
939987 [57785] settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was
939987 [57786] seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.
939987 [57787] 
939987 [57788] "No one in?" Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.
939987 [57789] 
939987 [57790] "Whom do you want?"
939987 [57791] 
939987 [57792] "A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the
939987 [57793] Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I've forgotten! 'At
939987 [57794] your service!'" a familiar voice cried suddenly.
939987 [57795] 
939987 [57796] Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He
939987 [57797] had just come in from the third room. "It is the hand of fate," thought
939987 [57798] Raskolnikov. "Why is he here?"
939987 [57799] 
939987 [57800] "You've come to see us? What about?" cried Ilya Petrovitch. He
939987 [57801] was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle
939987 [57802] exhilarated. "If it's on business you are rather early.[*] It's only a
939987 [57803] chance that I am here... however I'll do what I can. I must admit, I...
939987 [57804] what is it, what is it? Excuse me...."
939987 [57805] 
939987 [57806]      [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
939987 [57807]      sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
939987 [57808]      police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
939987 [57809]      coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.
939987 [57810] 
939987 [57811] "Raskolnikov."
939987 [57812] 
939987 [57813] "Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn't imagine I'd forgotten? Don't think I
939987 [57814] am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that's it, isn't it?"
939987 [57815] 
939987 [57816] "Rodion Romanovitch."
939987 [57817] 
939987 [57818] "Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I
939987 [57819] made many inquiries about you. I assure you I've been genuinely grieved
939987 [57820] since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me
939987 [57821] afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and
939987 [57822] so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific
939987 [57823] man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have
939987 [57824] the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it's a genuine passion!
939987 [57825] Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be
939987 [57826] gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,
939987 [57827] what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but
939987 [57828] what's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that! I was even
939987 [57829] meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd... But I
939987 [57830] am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your
939987 [57831] family have come?"
939987 [57832] 
939987 [57833] "Yes, my mother and sister."
939987 [57834] 
939987 [57835] "I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly
939987 [57836] cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with
939987 [57837] you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting
939987 [57838] fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!
939987 [57839] I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on
939987 [57840] account of your family's arriving?"
939987 [57841] 
939987 [57842] "No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find
939987 [57843] Zametov here."
939987 [57844] 
939987 [57845] "Oh, yes! Of course, you've made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is
939987 [57846] not here. Yes, we've lost Zametov. He's not been here since yesterday...
939987 [57847] he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a
939987 [57848] feather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected something
939987 [57849] from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.
939987 [57850] He wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk and
939987 [57851] boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it's a very
939987 [57852] different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your
939987 [57853] career is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure. For
939987 [57854] you, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an
939987 [57855] ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned
939987 [57856] research--that's where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....
939987 [57857] Have you read Livingstone's Travels?"
939987 [57858] 
939987 [57859] "No."
939987 [57860] 
939987 [57861] "Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,
939987 [57862] and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I
939987 [57863] ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me
939987 [57864] openly, openly!"
939987 [57865] 
939987 [57866] "N-no..."
939987 [57867] 
939987 [57868] "Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!
939987 [57869] Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say
939987 [57870] _friendship_ is quite another? No, you're wrong! It's not friendship,
939987 [57871] but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of
939987 [57872] love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound
939987 [57873] to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.
939987 [57874] Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad
939987 [57875] reputation, over a glass of champagne... that's all your Zametov is good
939987 [57876] for! While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty
939987 [57877] feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and
939987 [57878] have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is
939987 [57879] he, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then
939987 [57880] these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous."
939987 [57881] 
939987 [57882] Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya
939987 [57883] Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a
939987 [57884] stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He
939987 [57885] looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.
939987 [57886] 
939987 [57887] "I mean those crop-headed wenches," the talkative Ilya Petrovitch
939987 [57888] continued. "Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory
939987 [57889] one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am
939987 [57890] I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!" Ilya
939987 [57891] Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. "It's an immoderate
939987 [57892] zeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough. Why abuse
939987 [57893] it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why
939987 [57894] did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common
939987 [57895] they are, you can't fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill
939987 [57896] themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard
939987 [57897] about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what
939987 [57898] was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?"
939987 [57899] 
939987 [57900] "SvidrigaÃ¯lov," someone answered from the other room with drowsy
939987 [57901] listlessness.
939987 [57902] 
939987 [57903] Raskolnikov started.
939987 [57904] 
939987 [57905] "SvidrigaÃ¯lov! SvidrigaÃ¯lov has shot himself!" he cried.
939987 [57906] 
939987 [57907] "What, do you know SvidrigaÃ¯lov?"
939987 [57908] 
939987 [57909] "Yes... I knew him.... He hadn't been here long."
939987 [57910] 
939987 [57911] "Yes, that's so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and
939987 [57912] all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left
939987 [57913] in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his
939987 [57914] faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they
939987 [57915] say. How did you come to know him?"
939987 [57916] 
939987 [57917] "I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family."
939987 [57918] 
939987 [57919] "Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had
939987 [57920] no suspicion?"
939987 [57921] 
939987 [57922] "I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing."
939987 [57923] 
939987 [57924] Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling
939987 [57925] him.
939987 [57926] 
939987 [57927] "You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here..."
939987 [57928] 
939987 [57929] "Yes, I must go," muttered Raskolnikov. "Excuse my troubling you...."
939987 [57930] 
939987 [57931] "Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It's a pleasure to see you and I
939987 [57932] am glad to say so."
939987 [57933] 
939987 [57934] Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.
939987 [57935] 
939987 [57936] "I only wanted... I came to see Zametov."
939987 [57937] 
939987 [57938] "I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you."
939987 [57939] 
939987 [57940] "I... am very glad... good-bye," Raskolnikov smiled.
939987 [57941] 
939987 [57942] He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
939987 [57943] what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself
939987 [57944] with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed
939987 [57945] past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in
939987 [57946] the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a
939987 [57947] rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.
939987 [57948] There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.
939987 [57949] She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of
939987 [57950] poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips
939987 [57951] worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned
939987 [57952] and went back to the police office.
939987 [57953] 
939987 [57954] Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before
939987 [57955] him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.
939987 [57956] 
939987 [57957] "Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What's the matter?"
939987 [57958] 
939987 [57959] Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.
939987 [57960] He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say
939987 [57961] something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.
939987 [57962] 
939987 [57963] "You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!"
939987 [57964] 
939987 [57965] Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the
939987 [57966] face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both
939987 [57967] looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.
939987 [57968] 
939987 [57969] "It was I..." began Raskolnikov.
939987 [57970] 
939987 [57971] "Drink some water."
939987 [57972] 
939987 [57973] Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,
939987 [57974] but distinctly said:
939987 [57975] 
939987 [57976] "_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with
939987 [57977] an axe and robbed them._"
939987 [57978] 
939987 [57979] Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.
939987 [57980] 
939987 [57981] Raskolnikov repeated his statement.
939987 [57982] 
939987 [57983] 
939987 [57984] 
939987 [57985] EPILOGUE
939987 [57986] 
939987 [57987] I
939987 [57988] 
939987 [57989] Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of
939987 [57990] the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,
939987 [57991] in the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class
939987 [57992] convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a
939987 [57993] year and a half has passed since his crime.
939987 [57994] 
939987 [57995] There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered
939987 [57996] exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor
939987 [57997] misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit
939987 [57998] the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the
939987 [57999] secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which
939987 [58000] was found in the murdered woman's hand. He described minutely how he
939987 [58001] had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its
939987 [58002] contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described how
939987 [58003] Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said
939987 [58004] to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay
939987 [58005] and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards
939987 [58006] gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
939987 [58007] Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
939987 [58008] The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the
939987 [58009] judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he
939987 [58010] had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making
939987 [58011] use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the
939987 [58012] trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had
939987 [58013] never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed
939987 [58014] incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and
939987 [58015] seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,
939987 [58016] some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
939987 [58017] damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man
939987 [58018] should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made
939987 [58019] a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers
939987 [58020] more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really
939987 [58021] not looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when he
939987 [58022] hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that
939987 [58023] the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental
939987 [58024] derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of
939987 [58025] gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary
939987 [58026] insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover
939987 [58027] Raskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by
939987 [58028] Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.
939987 [58029] All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not
939987 [58030] quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another
939987 [58031] element in the case.
939987 [58032] 
939987 [58033] To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the
939987 [58034] criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question
939987 [58035] as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he
939987 [58036] answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was
939987 [58037] his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to
939987 [58038] provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand
939987 [58039] roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder
939987 [58040] through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by
939987 [58041] privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he
939987 [58042] Lost packet!
939987 [58043] coarse....
939987 [58044] 
939987 [58045] The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,
939987 [58046] perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,
939987 [58047] but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange
939987 [58048] and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.
939987 [58049] There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition
939987 [58050] of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he
939987 [58051] had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his
939987 [58052] Lost packet!
939987 [58053] murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man
939987 [58054] commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the
939987 [58055] confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by
939987 [58056] Lost packet!
939987 [58057] and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no
939987 [58058] suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did
939987 [58059] much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner's
939987 [58060] favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and
939987 [58061] proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor
939987 [58062] consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting
939987 [58063] him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit
939987 [58064] old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,
939987 [58065] Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral
939987 [58066] when he died. Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they
939987 [58067] Lost packet!
939987 [58068] little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was
939987 [58069] investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts
939987 [58070] made an impression in his favour.

939987 [58073] circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a
939987 [58074] term of eight years only.
939987 [58075] 
939987 [58076] At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Dounia
939987 [58077] and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the
939987 [58078] trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so
939987 [58079] as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time
939987 [58080] to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna's
939987 [58081] Lost packet!
939987 [58082] derangement of her intellect.
939987 [58083] 
939987 [58084] When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she
939987 [58085] had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening
939987 [58086] Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother's
939987 [58087] questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her
939987 [58088] mother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia
939987 [58089] on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and
939987 [58090] reputation.
939987 [58091] 
939987 [58092] But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never
939987 [58093] asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the
939987 [58094] contrary, she had her own version of her son's sudden departure; she
939987 [58095] told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting
939987 [58096] that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya
939987 [58097] had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be
939987 [58098] in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be
939987 [58099] brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured
939987 [58100] Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his
939987 [58101] article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was
939987 [58102] continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed
939987 [58103] with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was
939987 [58104] obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken
939987 [58105] Lost packet!
939987 [58106] 
939987 [58107] They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange
939987 [58108] silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of
939987 [58109] getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived
939987 [58110] on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of
939987 [58111] great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother
939987 [58112] suspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and was
939987 [58113] afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any
939987 [58114] case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of
939987 [58115] Lost packet!
939987 [58116] 
939987 [58117] It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave
939987 [58118] such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her
939987 [58119] without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and
939987 [58120] suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood
939987 [58121] lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive
939987 [58122] her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely
939987 [58123] silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that

939987 [58130] begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his
939987 [58131] future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,
939987 [58132] pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),
939987 [58133] but she still went on talking.
939987 [58134] 
939987 [58135] Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin
939987 [58136] and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last
939987 [58137] the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the
939987 [58138] separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in
939987 [58139] his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least
939987 [58140] of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving
939987 [58141] up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every
939987 [58142] natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There
939987 [58143] they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would
939987 [58144] begin a new life. They all wept at parting.
939987 [58145] 
939987 [58146] Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great
939987 [58147] Lost packet!
939987 [58148] so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his
939987 [58149] mother's illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly
939987 [58150] reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by
939987 [58151] SvidrigaÃ¯lov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the
939987 [58152] party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word
939987 [58153] passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it
939987 [58154] would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his
939987 [58155] sister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future
939987 [58156] together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their
939987 [58157] mother's illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last
939987 [58158] set off.
939987 [58159] 
939987 [58160] Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and
939987 [58161] Lost packet!
939987 [58162] During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
939987 [58163] Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she
939987 [58164] could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.
939987 [58165] Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order
939987 [58166] Lost packet!
939987 [58167] both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till
939987 [58168] Lost packet!
939987 [58169] Lost packet!
939987 [58170] Lost packet!
939987 [58171] marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more
939987 [58172] melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how
939987 [58173] Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father
939987 [58174] Lost packet!
939987 [58175] little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria
939987 [58176] Alexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was
939987 [58177] continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with
939987 [58178] Lost packet!
939987 [58179] Lost packet!
939987 [58180] Lost packet!
939987 [58181] student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did
939987 [58182] not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid
939987 [58183] excitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's name
939987 [58184] and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the
939987 [58185] address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted
939987 [58186] on going to see her.
939987 [58187] 
939987 [58188] At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes
939987 [58189] begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One
939987 [58190] morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,
939987 [58191] that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must
939987 [58192] expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,
939987 [58193] began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and
939987 [58194] Lost packet!
939987 [58195] helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual
939987 [58196] fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
939987 [58197] taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.
939987 [58198] Lost packet!
939987 [58199] dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her
939987 [58200] son's terrible fate than they had supposed.
939987 [58201] Lost packet!
939987 [58202] For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, though
939987 [58203] Lost packet!
939987 [58204] Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month
939987 [58205] to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At
939987 [58206] first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on
939987 [58207] they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for
939987 [58208] from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate
939987 [58209] brother's life. Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact
939987 [58210] detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's
939987 [58211] surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no
939987 [58212] Lost packet!
939987 [58213] any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the
939987 [58214] simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,
939987 [58215] what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her
939987 [58216] and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The
939987 [58217] Lost packet!
939987 [58218] and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but
939987 [58219] facts.
939987 [58220] 
939987 [58221] But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,
939987 [58222] especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not
939987 [58223] Lost packet!
939987 [58224] him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and
939987 [58225] that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last
939987 [58226] Lost packet!
939987 [58227] affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although
939987 [58228] Lost packet!
939987 [58229] Lost packet!
939987 [58230] that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,
939987 [58231] had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely
939987 [58232] Lost packet!
939987 [58233] had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his
939987 [58234] Lost packet!
939987 [58235] about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that
939987 [58236] at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have
939987 [58237] his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,
939987 [58238] declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote
939987 [58239] Lost packet!
939987 [58240] had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were
939987 [58241] crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a
939987 [58242] rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that
939987 [58243] Lost packet!
939987 [58244] Lost packet!
939987 [58245] 
939987 [58246] Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,
939987 [58247] had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and
939987 [58248] Lost packet!
939987 [58249] almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when
939987 [58250] she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him
939987 [58251] Lost packet!
939987 [58252] Lost packet!
939987 [58253] see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the
939987 [58254] sheds on the banks of the Irtish.
939987 [58255] 
939987 [58256] About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some
939987 [58257] acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there
939987 [58258] was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an
939987 [58259] indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the
939987 [58260] authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task
939987 [58261] was lightened and so on.
939987 [58262] 
939987 [58263] At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and
939987 [58264] uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,
939987 [58265] that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days
939987 [58266] at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote
939987 [58267] that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of
939987 [58268] the hospital.
939987 [58269] 
939987 [58270] 
939987 [58271] 
939987 [58272] II
939987 [58273] 
939987 [58274] He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not
939987 [58275] the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes
939987 [58276] that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!
939987 [58277] he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at
939987 [58278] least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to
939987 [58279] him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a
939987 [58280] student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited
939987 [58281] to his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed
939987 [58282] of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?
939987 [58283] Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he
939987 [58284] was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with
939987 [58285] his contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his
939987 [58286] fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was
939987 [58287] wounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he
939987 [58288] could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even
939987 [58289] shame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated
939987 [58290] conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except
939987 [58291] a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just
939987 [58292] because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief
939987 [58293] through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to
939987 [58294] "the idiocy" of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.
939987 [58295] 
939987 [58296] Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a
939987 [58297] continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before
939987 [58298] him. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he
939987 [58299] Lost packet!
939987 [58300] live for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live
939987 [58301] in order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to
939987 [58302] give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.
939987 [58303] Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted
939987 [58304] more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he
939987 [58305] had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.
939987 [58306] 
939987 [58307] And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that
939987 [58308] would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the
939987 [58309] Lost packet!
939987 [58310] have been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.
939987 [58311] But he did not repent of his crime.
939987 [58312] 
939987 [58313] At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he
939987 [58314] had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.
939987 [58315] But now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his
939987 [58316] actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque
939987 [58317] as they had seemed at the fatal time.
939987 [58318] 
939987 [58319] "In what way," he asked himself, "was my theory stupider than others
939987 [58320] that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has
939987 [58321] only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced
939987 [58322] by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.
939987 [58323] Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!
939987 [58324] 
939987 [58325] "Why does my action strike them as so horrible?" he said to himself. "Is
939987 [58326] Lost packet!
939987 [58327] Lost packet!
939987 [58328] was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the
939987 [58329] Lost packet!
939987 [58330] benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of
939987 [58331] inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But
939987 [58332] those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn't, and so I
939987 [58333] Lost packet!
939987 [58334] Lost packet!
939987 [58335] It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact
939987 [58336] Lost packet!
939987 [58337] 
939987 [58338] He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why
939987 [58339] Lost packet!
939987 [58340] desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not
939987 [58341] Lost packet!
939987 [58342] 
939987 [58343] In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,
939987 [58344] at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had
939987 [58345] perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and
939987 [58346] his convictions. He didn't understand that that consciousness might be
939987 [58347] the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future
939987 [58348] resurrection.
939987 [58349] 
939987 [58350] He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he
939987 [58351] could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at
939987 [58352] his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and
939987 [58353] prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in
939987 [58354] prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of
939987 [58355] them, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for
939987 [58356] Lost packet!
939987 [58357] in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and
939987 [58358] longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the
939987 [58359] green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he
939987 [58360] saw still more inexplicable examples.
939987 [58361] Lost packet!
939987 [58362] Lost packet!
939987 [58363] want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome
939987 [58364] and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that
939987 [58365] surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much
939987 [58366] that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was
939987 [58367] the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They
939987 [58368] seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at
939987 [58369] him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his
939987 [58370] isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons
939987 [58371] were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political
939987 [58372] prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as
939987 [58373] ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.
939987 [58374] He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the
939987 [58375] Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former
939987 [58376] Lost packet!
939987 [58377] He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at
939987 [58378] last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised
939987 [58379] Lost packet!
939987 [58380] 
939987 [58381] "You're a gentleman," they used to say. "You shouldn't hack about with
939987 [58382] an axe; that's not a gentleman's work."
939987 [58383] 
939987 [58384] The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his
939987 [58385] gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out
939987 [58386] one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.
939987 [58387] 
939987 [58388] "You're an infidel! You don't believe in God," they shouted. "You ought
939987 [58389] to be killed."
939987 [58390] 
939987 [58391] He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to
939987 [58392] kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at
939987 [58393] him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;
939987 [58394] Lost packet!
939987 [58395] succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would
939987 [58396] have been bloodshed.
939987 [58397] 
939987 [58398] There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so
939987 [58399] fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met
939987 [58400] Lost packet!
939987 [58401] everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,
939987 [58402] knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no
939987 [58403] particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents
939987 [58404] of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between
939987 [58405] Lost packet!
939987 [58406] relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their
939987 [58407] instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives
939987 [58408] and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited
939987 [58409] Lost packet!
939987 [58410] Lost packet!
939987 [58411] Lost packet!
939987 [58412] frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was
939987 [58413] Lost packet!
939987 [58414] to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in
939987 [58415] fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her
939987 [58416] Lost packet!
939987 [58417] Lost packet!
939987 [58418] Lost packet!
939987 [58419] he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish
939987 [58420] and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a
939987 [58421] Lost packet!
939987 [58422] Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts
939987 [58423] of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were
939987 [58424] endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once
939987 [58425] mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual
939987 [58426] and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never
939987 [58427] had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their
939987 [58428] moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples
939987 [58429] went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand
939987 [58430] one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched
939987 [58431] looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung
939987 [58432] his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to
939987 [58433] Lost packet!
939987 [58434] Lost packet!
939987 [58435] Lost packet!
939987 [58436] the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken
939987 [58437] Lost packet!
939987 [58438] and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in
939987 [58439] the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was
939987 [58440] summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,
939987 [58441] because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they
939987 [58442] Lost packet!
939987 [58443] on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something
939987 [58444] quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,
939987 [58445] Lost packet!
939987 [58446] men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and
939987 [58447] Lost packet!
939987 [58448] Lost packet!
939987 [58449] a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these
939987 [58450] men, no one had heard their words and their voices.
939987 [58451] 
939987 [58452] Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so
939987 [58453] miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.
939987 [58454] The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring
939987 [58455] days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel
939987 [58456] paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during
939987 [58457] his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was
939987 [58458] difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially
939987 [58459] in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the
939987 [58460] windows of the ward.
939987 [58461] 
939987 [58462] One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On
939987 [58463] waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the
939987 [58464] distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.

939987 [58466] Lost packet!
939987 [58467] after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was
939987 [58468] discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that
939987 [58469] Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.
939987 [58470] Lost packet!
939987 [58471] Lost packet!
939987 [58472] her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,
939987 [58473] Lost packet!
939987 [58474] that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and
939987 [58475] Lost packet!
939987 [58476] 
939987 [58477] Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he
939987 [58478] went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster
939987 [58479] and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only
939987 [58480] three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the
939987 [58481] fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and
939987 [58482] laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river
939987 [58483] Lost packet!
939987 [58484] wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before
939987 [58485] him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
939987 [58486] In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black
939987 [58487] specks, the nomads' tents. There there was freedom, there other men were
939987 [58488] living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand
939987 [58489] Lost packet!
939987 [58490] Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into
939987 [58491] contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited
939987 [58492] and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up
939987 [58493] noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the
939987 [58494] Lost packet!
939987 [58495] Lost packet!
939987 [58496] paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand
939987 [58497] with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand
939987 [58498] to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would
939987 [58499] repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always
939987 [58500] seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout
939987 [58501] her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply
939987 [58502] grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance
939987 [58503] Lost packet!
939987 [58504] alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.
939987 [58505] 
939987 [58506] How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to
939987 [58507] seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round
939987 [58508] her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she
939987 [58509] turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same
939987 [58510] Lost packet!
939987 [58511] eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and

939987 [58524] 
939987 [58525] On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,
939987 [58526] Lost packet!
939987 [58527] that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him
939987 [58528] differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered
939987 [58529] Lost packet!
939987 [58530] to be so. Wasn't everything now bound to be changed?
939987 [58531] Lost packet!
939987 [58532] He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her
939987 [58533] Lost packet!
939987 [58534] But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what

939987 [58536] Lost packet!
939987 [58537] Lost packet!
939987 [58538] external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not

939987 [58540] Lost packet!
939987 [58541] into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself

939987 [58544] Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.

939987 [58552] 
939987 [58553] He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: "Can
939987 [58554] her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at
939987 [58555] least...."
939987 [58556] 
939987 [58557] She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken
939987 [58558] Lost packet!
939987 [58559] almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At

939987 [58567] renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing
939987 [58568] from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.

939987 [58622] electronic works
939987 [58623] 
939987 [58624] 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
939987 [58625] electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
939987 [58626] and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
939987 [58627] (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
939987 [58628] the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
939987 [58629] all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
939987 [58630] If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
939987 [58631] Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
939987 [58632] terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
939987 [58633] entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
939987 [58634] 
939987 [58635] 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
939987 [58636] used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
939987 [58637] agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
939987 [58638] things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
939987 [58639] even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
939987 [58640] paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
939987 [58641] Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
939987 [58642] and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
939987 [58643] works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
939987 [58644] 
939987 [58645] 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
939987 [58646] or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
939987 [58647] Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
939987 [58648] collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
939987 [58649] individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
939987 [58650] located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
939987 [58651] copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
939987 [58652] works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
939987 [58653] are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
939987 [58654] Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
939987 [58655] freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
939987 [58656] this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
939987 [58657] the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
939987 [58658] keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
939987 [58659] Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
939987 [58660] 
939987 [58661] 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
939987 [58662] what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
939987 [58663] a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
939987 [58664] the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
939987 [58665] before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
939987 [58666] creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
939987 [58667] Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

939987 [58669] States.

939987 [58696] 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
939987 [58697] with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
939987 [58698] must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional

939987 [58771] 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
939987 [58772] effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

939987 [58774] collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

939987 [58776] "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

939987 [58792] LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
939987 [58793] INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
939987 [58794] DAMAGE.

939987 [58800] received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
939987 [58801] your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
939987 [58802] the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

939987 [58804] providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
939987 [58805] receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
939987 [58806] is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

939987 [58818] interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
939987 [58819] the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
939987 [58820] provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

939987 [58827] harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

939987 [58834] Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
939987 [58835] 
939987 [58836] Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
939987 [58837] electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
939987 [58838] including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
939987 [58839] because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
939987 [58840] people in all walks of life.
939987 [58841] 
939987 [58842] Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
939987 [58843] assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
939987 [58844] goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
939987 [58845] remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
939987 [58846] Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
939987 [58847] and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
939987 [58848] To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
939987 [58849] and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

939987 [58879] Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
939987 [58880] Literary Archive Foundation
939987 [58881] 
939987 [58882] Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
939987 [58883] spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
939987 [58884] increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
939987 [58885] freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
939987 [58886] array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
939987 [58887] ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
939987 [58888] status with the IRS.
939987 [58889] 
939987 [58890] The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
939987 [58891] charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
939987 [58892] States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
939987 [58893] considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
939987 [58894] with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
939987 [58895] where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
939987 [58896] SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
939987 [58897] particular state visit http://pglaf.org
939987 [58898] 
939987 [58899] While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
939987 [58900] have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
939987 [58901] against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
939987 [58902] approach us with offers to donate.
939987 [58903] 
939987 [58904] International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
939987 [58905] any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
939987 [58906] outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
939987 [58907] 
939987 [58908] Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
939987 [58909] methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
939987 [58910] ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

939987 [58914] Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
939987 [58915] works.
939987 [58916] 
939987 [58917] Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
939987 [58918] concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
939987 [58919] with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
939987 [58920] Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
939987 [58921] 
939987 [58922] 
939987 [58923] Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
939987 [58924] editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
939987 [58925] unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
939987 [58926] keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
